These depict an enormous archway emblazoned with five glyphs surrounded by a five-pointed star. Below the archway—or perhaps behind it—looms something grotesque. The lines of the sketch disintegrate into a tangle of light strokes and splotches of ink you can scarcely describe. Several more creatures with barrel-shaped bodies and starfish-like heads—the alien “Elder Things” Dyer described in his report—flank the archway, looking on reverently, their wing-like appendages spread forth in reverence. You wish you could ask Dyer himself what this may mean, but sadly, it’s too late for that. You collect his sketches and bring them with you, hoping they might come in handy later."

You’re not sure why Danforth thought there was any reason to bring such a collection of tales, most especially one so beloved to him. You open it to one of the tabbed pages and read: “He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ‘Tekeli-li!’” In the margins, Danforth has scribbled: “What could force one out of such paroxysm?

From there, the notes become less detailed and more jumbled. Her recounting of the days leading up to the plane crash is less a well-kept diary and more a delirious tangent. She wrote of walls dripping with black miasma, an endless void beneath the ice, something evil and alien that dwelled at the core beyond the gateway—and then, nothing.\nDr. Kensler had not been one to recount dreams or author works of fiction. Something had rattled her. Something had made her see the things of which she wrote. But how? And when? You sit and continue her documentation with your own record of events, hoping grimly that if you don’t make it off this continent alive, someone will read this and know what transpired here…"

You heft the backpack straps onto your shoulders and turn to leave Dr. Sinha’s tent, hoping to put this grim business out of mind.

Inside are several of Cookie’s personal effects—a pocketwatch with a cracked face, a matchbook emblazoned with the logo of the Excelsior Hotel, and of course his trusty .32 Colt revolver. It is exceptionally well-maintained, its barrel polished clean and its wooden grip immaculate. Knowing Cookie, it had less to do with his love of the thing and more to do with old habits dying hard.

They chose precisely the right place to build their city. And the way these structures and streets are built, they're mostly protected from excess snowfall.” He glances at you meaningfully before continuing. “These creatures chose the harshest place on Earth to make their home, and despite all odds, they thrived.” You wonder if perhaps this means the inclement weather you've faced thus far will abate during the next leg of your journey. “Unlikey,” he responds. “A lot of the natural safeguards they built into their city seem to have weathered away.

Anyu has helped me through a lot of situations like… well, I suppose I have never quite been in a situation like this. But she has always been there for me. And she seems to have taken a particular liking to you, too.” As if she understands Eliyah's words, the dog gazes at you warmly. You smile again and tell her that you feel the same way.

You reach instinctively for a weapon to defend yourself, but when you peer about, nothing is out of place. In fact…\nYou rise to your feet, shocked, and examine your surroundings. Your makeshift camp was protected from the harsh elements, but still deep in the Antarctic wilderness. And yet, you find yourself indoors, in a hall that you cannot place, though it seems familiar to you. You brush aside some of the snow that still lingers on the ground around your sleeping bag, noting a tiled floor that wasn't there before. A dream?\nAs you doubt the truth of this mysterious place, the walls and the tiled floor shimmer and fade. You are left back in the freezing cold of your camp, surrounded by your companions-except the door leading out of that hall still remains. Thick gray mist swirls around you, guiding you onward.\nThis is no natural refraction of light. Something supernatural is at work here. The thick miasma that churns around your camp is not unlike the substance that makes up the nightmarish creatures you encountered after your plane crashed. Do you really want to know what it wants you to see?"
