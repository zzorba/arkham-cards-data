You're not sure what would be worse—a slow death trapped inside an icy cavern, or an equally slow one failing to reach the summit. But when one of your companions switches on their flashlight, you realize there may be a third option.\nThe walls of this narrow tunnel are covered in strange hieroglyphs, the likes of which you've never seen. The ancient writings of an alien language, you presume. Possibly even that of the Elder Things who once called this region home. More importantly, the cavern continues deeper and deeper into the side of the mountain, far beyond the reach of your light.\nYou take a vote and decide to press onward, hoping beyond hope that the tunnel might take you to another exit. To your surprise, the journey is smooth, although the ever-present darkness, the frightening echoes of uncanny groans, and the muffled voices of something deep below wear upon your sanity. For hours you continue on, until finally, mercifully, you see light in the distance.\nYou emerge once more onto the side of the mountain, this time to a breathtaking vista. Sprawled before you lies the city described in Dyer's report. Its haunting visage is unmistakable. Dozens of conical and pyramidal buildings of dark slate and sandstone are honeycombed throughout the region like a labyrinth of perfect geometric shapes. Though weathered by the ages, the city still stands, hidden by the jagged peaks and the heavy snow.\nFor a while, you stand in silence and take in the wondrous sight. Somehow, you have managed to find a way through the mountain. If it weren't for the many trials you faced along the way, it would be a moment of triumph. But after the sacrifices made to get here, the victory rings hollow. After a moment's rest, you begin the long trek down into the alien city. You will have to make camp before you reach the bottom.
