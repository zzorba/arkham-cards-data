The creatures that dwell within are the same that Dyer and Danforth described from their journey—shapeless monstrosities composed of viscous, bubbling jelly and covered in lidless eyes. You flee back to the gateway to rest and lick your wounds, but before you can decide what to do next, something slams against the ancient, massive doorway, scaring you nearly to death. It reverberates through the facility. Then another, and another. You try to flee, but it's too late.",
