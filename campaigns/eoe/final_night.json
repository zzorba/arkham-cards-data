It was hard enough to tell the time with the sun always lingering in the Antarctic sky—now, deep underground with no sunlight to speak of, it is impossible. When one of your companions checks their pocketwatch and informs the team that fourteen hours have passed since you went underground, the response is one of utter disbelief. You do not remember traveling that long, but your body is weary enough to prove it.\nIn gloomy silence, you and the others set up camp once more. Your numbers have dwindled to only yourself and the few experts who remain from those originally introduced to you by Dr. Kensler. The rest of the students and researchers are either back at the barrier camp where you first disembarked from the Theodosia, or… no longer with you.\nThe cavern is easily large enough for what few of you remain, and the icy floor brittle enough to stake down your tents. Even so, it does not truly feel safe. You wonder if you will ever feel safe again."

These depict an enormous archway emblazoned with five glyphs surrounded by a five-pointed star. Below the archway—or perhaps behind it—looms something grotesque. The lines of the sketch disintegrate into a tangle of light strokes and splotches of ink you can scarcely describe. Several more creatures with barrel-shaped bodies and starfish-like heads—the alien “Elder Things” Dyer described in his report—flank the archway, looking on reverently, their wing-like appendages spread forth in reverence. You wish you could ask Dyer himself what this may mean, but sadly, it’s too late for that. You collect his sketches and bring them with you, hoping they might come in handy later."

You’re not sure why Danforth thought there was any reason to bring such a collection of tales, most especially one so beloved to him. You open it to one of the tabbed pages and read: “He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ‘Tekeli-li!’” In the margins, Danforth has scribbled: “What could force one out of such paroxysm? How can I leave this dreadful feeling behind?”"

You've never seen Dr. Kensler in such disarray before. \"Ah! Here.\" The book she identifies is not one of her treatises on biology or a textbook filled with anatomical diagrams. It is an old, moldy tome unrelated to any of the sciences, written in French. \"I know I saw it in here…\" she mumbles, scouring the tome's pages for a specific passage. You sit nearby in silence, almost too frightened to ask anything. Dr. Kensler has changed completely from her usual cold, stoic demeanor. \"Here!\" She marks her page and snaps back to you. \"Can I trust you?\" You nod your head. Whatever Dr. Kensler has found, you get the feeling she is only showing you because you have shared in her discoveries up until this point. She opens the tome to a depiction of some unfamiliar, cosmic hierarchy-the kind of absurd dogmatic theory that any self-respecting scientist would scoff at. \"Henry Armitage was the only other person at the university who did not approve of this undertaking. He is the one who showed me this, after Dyer submitted his report.\" She points to the section of the diagram illustrating the Earth, and you note the pattern of intersecting lines at its edge. \"The south pole,\" she says. \"At the edge of the Earth, where the lines meet. The culmination of eldritch forces, he said. Superstitious nonsense, I presumed. But my research proves otherwise. These creatures—these phantom mirages, eidolons of broken minds, they did not arrive here. They were always here. From the very beginning.

Perhaps she knew more about these creatures than she let on. You scour her tent and filter through her belongings until you come across a thick journal filled with meticulous notes regarding the journey to Antarctica and the first couple days you spent unloading supplies and setting up camp. From there, the notes become less detailed and more jumbled. Her recounting of the days leading up to the plane crash is less a well-kept diary and more a delirious tangent. She wrote of walls dripping with black miasma, an endless void beneath the ice, something evil and alien that dwelled at the core beyond the gateway—and then, nothing.\nDr. Kensler had not been one to recount dreams or author works of fiction. Something had rattled her. Something had made her see the things of which she wrote. But how? And when? You sit and continue her documentation with your own record of events, hoping grimly that if you don’t make it off this continent alive, someone will read this and know what transpired here…"

That is just the nature of things, I suppose. We are fragile creatures, after all. Bend us just a little bit, and we tend to break.\" She winds a bandage around your arm with practiced precision, but you spot the subtle shaking in her hands. \"I went into this profession because I could not stand seeing people hurt. It was a pretty foolish decision, looking back. After all, in this profession, all I do is see people hurt.\" You ask her if there is any satisfaction in seeing them healthy, once her work is done. \"Of course,\" she replies, after a long sigh. \"But this time…\" She averts her gaze from your eyes, her voice practically a whisper. \"I do not think I will get that satisfaction.

You heft the backpack straps onto your shoulders and turn to leave Dr. Sinha’s tent, hoping to put this grim business out of mind. The quiet clatter of something falling out of the backpack’s front pocket catches your attention.

You remark that you're lucky he has any trigger discipline left. \"Trigger discipline,\" he scoffs. A long pause hangs in the air. \"C'mon. Help me with the fire.\" In silence, you and the grizzled veteran set what remains of your firewood in the center of the camp and attempt to light it. In the cold, damp conditions, it takes almost half an hour of effort before the fire is lit. It eagerly consumes the kindling, casting dancing shadows along the icy walls of the cavern. Finally, Cookie breaks the silence. \"This,\" he utters decisively. \"I remember this.\" You don't bother to ask—you only have to meet his faraway gaze to know he is referring to the feeling of impending death permeating the camp. \"Piece of advice\" he offers, \"when the time comes, you can't hesitate.

Inside are several of Cookie’s personal effects—a pocketwatch with a cracked face, a matchbook emblazoned with the logo of the Excelsior Hotel, and of course his trusty .32 Colt revolver.

Into places we should not end up.\" You shrug and point out the fact that you, too, are here with him. \"Right. So I doubt your opinion of me is unbiased,\" he jokes.

The foul gust dies down around you, but it clearly came from the left-hand path. \"Something that way is circulating air. That has to mean something, right?\" You nod in agreement, but you sure as hell don't like the smell of it…"

You reach instinctively for a weapon to defend yourself, but when you peer about, nothing is out of place. In fact…\nYou rise to your feet, shocked, and examine your surroundings. Your makeshift camp was protected from the harsh elements, but still deep in the Antarctic wilderness. And yet, you find yourself indoors, in a hall that you cannot place, though it seems familiar to you. You brush aside some of the snow that still lingers on the ground around your sleeping bag, noting a tiled floor that wasn't there before. A dream?\nAs you doubt the truth of this mysterious place, the walls and the tiled floor shimmer and fade. You are left back in the freezing cold of your camp, surrounded by your companions-except the door leading out of that hall still remains. Thick gray mist swirls around you, guiding you onward.\nThis is no natural refraction of light. Something supernatural is at work here. The thick miasma that churns around your camp is not unlike the substance that makes up the nightmarish creatures you encountered after your plane crashed. Do you really want to know what it wants you to see?"
