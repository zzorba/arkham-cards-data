Part of you knows that staying any longer would prove foolish or deadly. But a great many questions crowd your thoughts, demanding answers despite your worries. What were those uncanny, Phantasmal creatures? What happened here after Dyer’s expedition left the icy wastes behind?\nYou and the others discuss the situation at length and consider various plans. Some believe in the total abandonment of the expedition. But to return empty-handed now would prove disastrous for the university, frustrate the scientific community, and possibly cost the remaining crew their careers. After all, very few believed Dyer’s outlandish claims --who would believe this?\nIn the end, you decide to press onward. Another flight is out of the question, of course. That thing in the sky must still be out there. It was a miracle you survived one aeroplane crash, let alone two. No, there’s only one way to reach the site described in Dyer’s report now: you must travel on foot.\nThe decision made, you retire to get what meager rest you can before the grueling trek ahead."

And as a man of science, I find myself struggling to…to come to terms with what we have seen thus far.” You nod and ask Dyer to explain his current working theory. “Well,” he begins, “these spectral creatures, they seem to possess some kind of ethereal physiology, very unlike the Elder Things that Lake and his team discovered and dissected the last time I was here. Those creatures might have been of alien origin, but they were…like us, in more ways than one. Flesh and organs, you see. But these…” he ponders in silence for some time. “And yet, I cannot help but wonder what the connection between the two might be?”"

These depict an enormous archway emblazoned with five glyphs surrounded by a five-pointed star. Below the archway—or perhaps behind it—looms something grotesque. The lines of the sketch disintegrate into a tangle of light strokes and splotches of ink you can scarcely describe. Several more creatures with barrel-shaped bodies and starfish-like heads—the alien “Elder Things” Dyer described in his report—flank the archway, looking on reverently, their wing-like appendages spread forth in reverence. You wish you could ask Dyer himself what this may mean, but sadly, it’s too late for that. You collect his sketches and bring them with you, hoping they might come in handy later."

You’re not sure why Danforth thought there was any reason to bring such a collection of tales, most especially one so beloved to him. You open it to one of the tabbed pages and read: “He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ‘Tekeli-li!’” In the margins, Danforth has scribbled: “What could force one out of such paroxysm?

You heft the backpack straps onto your shoulders and turn to leave Dr. Sinha’s tent, hoping to put this grim business out of mind. The quiet clatter of something falling out of the backpack’s front pocket catches your attention. You search around your feet for the object and find a small leather wallet containing only a hairpin, a picture of Dr. Sinha with what you can only assume to be her family, and a ticket stub for a show at the Riverview Theatre.

Inside are several of Cookie’s personal effects—a pocketwatch with a cracked face, a matchbook emblazoned with the logo of the Excelsior Hotel, and of course his trusty .32 Colt revolver.

There are others who feel the opposite: that we should leave immediately and find safety elsewhere.

Black, jagged mountains loom in the distance, barely visible through the harsh snowfall. “There,” he says, pointing between two of the peaks. “What does that look like, to you?” You raise the telescope up to your eyes, careful not to press the cold glass against your skin lest it freeze there. Magnified by the device’s lens, you can just make out a narrow pass between the peaks. Perhaps this would be the optimal route to take tomorrow?

You ponder aloud if she realizes the danger you’re all in. “Oh, she knows,” Eliyah responds. “She is rather good at making all the troubles of the world fade away. It wouldn’t be the first time.” You wonder with a bit of curiosity what other adventures Eliyah and Anyu might have been on in the past. But before you can ask, a cold flask hits you square in the chest and tumbles into your hands. “Drink,” Eliyah offers. “It’ll warm you up.” He sits down and drinks from a flask of his own, motioning for you to join him. You do, gulping down a large swallow. It burns on its way down. Anyu lies between the two of you, nudging your hand pleadingly. No more words are spoken, but Eliyah is right. For just a moment, everything is okay."

A dream?\nAs you doubt the truth of this mysterious place, the walls and the tiled floor shimmer and fade. You are left back in the freezing cold of your camp, surrounded by your companions—except the door leading out of that hall still remains. Thick gray mist swirls around you, guiding you onward.\nThis is no natural refraction of light. Something supernatural is at work here.
