Each part is its own game with its own setup and resolution.\nAfter completing one part of a scenario, the campaign guide directs the investigators to a Checkpoint that instructs them how to proceed. If the investigators wish to proceed directly to the next part of the scenario, the Checkpoint will instruct them how to clean up the game to prepare for the next part of the scenario. If the investigators wish to take a break and resume playing during their next game session, the Checkpoint will instruct them to record information in the Campaign Log that makes setup for the next session quick and easy."

During Bob's first investigation attempt, he reveals a [frost] token. This reduces his skill value by 1 and causes him to reveal another token. The next token he reveals is a +1, resulting in a total of 0 from both tokens. Bob succeeds! Emboldened, Bob attempts to investigate a second time.
