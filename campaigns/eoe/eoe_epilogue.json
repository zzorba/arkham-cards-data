The two of them share a knowing glance. \"A vacation, I think,\" Ellsworth says. \"A very, very long vacation.\"\n\"Nothing but blue skies and warm air,\" Claypool suggests.\n\"Sure. Somewhere that is on a map, preferably,\" Ellsworth adds with a gentle smile.\n\"Really? I was thinking somewhere nice and remote. Just the two of us,\" Claypool hints.\nYou chuckle and leave the two of them to their vacation plans. Perhaps there is hope for the lot of you, after all."

And perhaps another show?\" she finally manages to say.\nDr. Sinha rolls her eyes, hiding a smile. \"Yes, you idiot.\"\nDr. Kensler blinks in surprise. You get the feeling she has never been called such a thing before.\n\"Amy, you are highly astute, incredibly well read, and a true prodigy in your field.
