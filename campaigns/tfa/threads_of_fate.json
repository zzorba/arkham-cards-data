When you emerge from your bedroom the next morning, your uninvited guest is sitting at your dining-room table, arms crossed tightly across her chest. Her piercing eyes trace your every move like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged. “Where is the relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain that it is safe, in good hands. She shakes her head, her knuckles white with frustration. “I assure you it is not.”"

Their methods are secret and furtive, and their motives elude you still. However, one piece of vital information has come to light.\n“They seek a place known as the Nexus of N’kai,” Ichtaca claims. A map of Central America lies on the table before you, marked with the previous expedition’s trail. “I have heard of this place, but its exact location is not known to me.” Once again, your mysterious guide appears to know more than she lets on.\nWith no other leads to follow, you are left with no choice.
