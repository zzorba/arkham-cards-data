How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\nAlejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private. I’ll have to decide tonight; after tomorrow, there won’t be time to change my mind…"

If anyone can discover the relic’s secrets, it’s him.\nThe relic is to be the centerpiece of a new exhibit at the museum. Alejandro has already written extensively about our discoveries, but his work has only just begun. Many mysteries about our expedition remain. How have the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear to be guarding the jungle, and from what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored? I have no doubt Alejandro will uncover the answers to these questions, given enough time.\nAs for me, my role in this endeavor has ended. However, I have yet to relax. My thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths. When I walk through the streets, I find myself drawn toward the museum without realizing it, as though possessed to see the relic once again. There is a nagging sensation in the back of my mind, as though we have forgotten something important. What must I do to rid myself of—\n(The journal entry ends abruptly.)"

I should never have encouraged them to go on that dreadful expedition.” Though your paths have only crossed a few times before, Mr. Earnstone has become a valuable contact of yours within Miskatonic University. When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet…I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures they encountered…” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for all of us. Read this journal, and if you can, please keep an eye on my colleague.” You agree to help, but his worry does not fade. “I only hope that I am not damning you to a similar fate by asking for your aid.”\nYou spend the remainder of that night studying the expedition journal, your mind swimming with thoughts of strange serpent-creatures and Aztec warriors. Long after Harlan has left, a loud knocking at the door startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in the morning. Who could possibly be at your door at this hour? You open the front door warily. On the other side is a woman with brown skin, long brown hair, and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard glare. She wears a long coat and a Bollman-style hat, visibly uncomfortable in her shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. A sudden flash of insight crosses your mind, and you realize at once who she must be. After all, you’ve read and re-read the journal’s description of Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior. She lets out a heavy sigh and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever they did, you have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will all cease to exist.”"
