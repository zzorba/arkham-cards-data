Fortunately, you have seen no sign yet of the serpent people who attacked the previous expedition, but you’re positive they are out there. Watching. Waiting.\nOn the morning of the sixth day, you find the entrance. It is a huge cave opening, partially obscured by trees, brush, and vines. You nearly missed the great cavern maw altogether, despite its enormity. Surrounding the cavern’s entrance are six stone pillars, each covered in strange grooves and carvings that glow with a dim red hue. Perhaps one of your guides will understand what this means?"
