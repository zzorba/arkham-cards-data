Ichtaca approaches the campfire and sits across from you. Her eyes are cast to the ground, and her shoulders sag with a burdensome weight. “I feel that I must apologize to you,” she admits, peering into the flickering fire. “You have proven yourselves to be both wise and formidable, and I have done nothing but command you and endanger you at every turn.” There is a long, peaceful pause between you. “Perhaps there is hope for humanity after all,” she says under her breath as she meets your gaze. Does she speak for you? Or for herself, as well?\nIchtaca rises to her feet after some time. “I trust you to take the first watch. Be on the lookout for serpents. They are surely on the lookout for us.” Your camp is quiet for the remainder of the night, but for the soothing crackling of the campfire and the choir of chirping insects whose singing fills the night air."
