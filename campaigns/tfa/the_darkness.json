You are in the deepest level of this subterranean realm now: the caverns Ichtaca referred to as “N’kai.” Nothing could have prepared you for the impervious murk that surrounds you on all sides, an inky darkness that none of your light sources can penetrate. You grope around in the darkness until you feel the jagged wall of the cavern and begin to follow it aimlessly, desperately hoping to find the way forward. A grim realization dawns on you: Even should you complete your task, you will surely never find a way back to the surface. The overwhelming darkness of the cavern fills you with a dread you have never before experienced. You cannot see your hands as you grope about in the darkness, nor can you tell if you are in a narrow tunnel or a vast open space. The ground beside you could extend for miles or abruptly become a bottomless cavern, and you would not be able to tell the difference unless you stepped there. Hours pass as you stumble in the dark, slowly, carefully, nervously. Every step could be your last."
