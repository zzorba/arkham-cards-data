It has been several days since you hit the road from Arkham on your way to Mexico City, where you may be able to get answers from some of Alejandro’s associates—or even better, from his adversaries in academia. Your recent investigations in Arkham uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail went cold soon after. The “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but vanished from the city. Its members left behind little information as to their next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever, the Eztli warrior sits in the passenger seat next to you. She is tense and coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her little comfort."

The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\nIchtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\nCrossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\nPadma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs.\nOnce she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation…"

The glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples. Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air.\nRising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\nYour head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back. I know where to find the Nexus, and you must journey with me.”",

Perhaps she wished to know the location of the Nexus, as well,” Ichtaca says cryptically. Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of the past few hours. “You saw it, did you not? The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\nIt is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing…Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains unspoken: In the haze of broken timelines and unexplainable phenomena, the path you saw was “one future.” A future you intend to fulfill.",
