I am curious how deep Alejandro’s connections are in Mexico. For an outcast historian, he was able to secure guns and ammunition faster than I had anticipated. But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\nWe ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple. Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?"

I told Maria, the expedition’s naturalist, to take one of the trucks and wait beyond the northern edge of the rainforest. Our cartographer, José, is guarding the camp until we return.

For the sake of my fallen comrades, I have taken it upon myself to record the remainder of our expedition in this journal.\nThe others never made it out of the temple. I convinced two of the other members of the expedition, José and Andrea, to venture in after the others…But now I fear a terrible fate has befallen them, as well.\nThankfully, my gambit was worthwhile. While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\nIn the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device. The orb was made of an unnatural steel, attached delicately to its bronze frame. It pulsed with power in my hands and glowed with a dim blue light. Any fool could tell that it was not made by the Aztecs, but the other members of the expedition could not even begin to understand its true significance. The ruins started to crumble around me as I left, but it mattered not. The relic was all that mattered now.\nWith the artifact in tow, I returned to camp and told the others it was time to depart. Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. Now we are headed to Texas, where we will cross the border into the United States.\nIt is a shame what happened to the others. Their sacrifice will not be in vain. Now, my work can continue.\n– Alejandro Vela",

José had brought some TNT from the trucks, and there was more than enough to level the damned place.\nThat night, we put on a hell of a fireworks show. The jungle protested. Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\nJosé was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\nWith the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\nMaria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City. Even now I do not feel safe: who could, after seeing what we have seen?\nTo hell with the Eztli and to hell with this forsaken place.",
