She spends her first action to explore, drawing the top card of the exploration deck. The card she draws is Desert Oasis. Because Desert Oasis is a location that is not connected to the Expedition Camp, it is placed next to the exploration deck, and Ursula draws the next card in the exploration deck. This time, she draws the Sandstorm treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Desert Oasis that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action. This time, she draws Nile River, which is connected to the Expedition Camp. Her exploration is successful. Nile River is put into play with clues on it equal to its clue value, and Ursula immediately moves from the Expedition Camp to the Nile River.</i>"
