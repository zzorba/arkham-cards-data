I don't even know if this letter will make it to you safely. I can only hope it does, for all our sakes.</fancy>\n<fancy>There's something wrong in this city. It started a few weeks ago. The head curator of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities fell asleep and simply never awoke. I thought nothing of it at first; just a medical curiosity, a mystery the doctors would solve in due time. But then it happened again. And again. More and more, people all across the city started falling into comas. Now it's happening every night. . . And as I write to you, they are taking my husband John to the hospital.</fancy>\n<fancy>I'm scared. I don't want to fall asleep and never wake up again. But more than that, I'm worried that there are people purposely inflicting this curse on others. And if so, why?</fancy>\n<fancy>Please, I am begging you. I need your help.</fancy>\n<fancy>Yours sincerely,</fancy>\n<fancy>Jessie Burk</fancy>"
