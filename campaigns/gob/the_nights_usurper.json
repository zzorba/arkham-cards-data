As the leader of the expedition currently scouring through Dashur, the decision of whether or not to let you join the expedition is up to him. “Look, I read through the evidence you gathered. I know about what happened in Cairo. I believe your story. But, still…” He lets out an exasperated sigh. “I just don’t know how I’m going to convince the rest of the expedition crew. Ancient temples is one thing, but a gate to another dimension? This ‘Xzharah’ fellow? None of this can be real, right?”\nYour research and your experience says otherwise. The threat is real. There is a secret organization operating within Egypt—The Brotherhood of the Beast—and if they are not stopped, their newfound “Chosen One” will begin a campaign of destruction that ends with the Earth.\nYou insist one last time to be allowed access to the expedition’s resources. “Alright, alright,” Winlock relents. “I don’t know what it is you’re looking for out there in the desert, but I hope you find it.” You shake your head in reply. You’d rather come up empty‑handed."
