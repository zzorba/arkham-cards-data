Just as you're considering finding somewhere to catch some sleep, your attention is caught by the sound of wheels rattling on unpaved stones. You peer into a nearby alley, and see a man in a doctor's coat trying to push a wobbling gurney through a side door. A man whose face you recognize.\nIt takes you a moment to place him, but the mousy figure can only be Doctor West - one of your two attending physicians at St. Mary's. What is he doing here? At this time of night? With a dead body?\nBefore you can answer, several cars come barreling down the street. By the time they've passed, West is nowhere to be seen."
