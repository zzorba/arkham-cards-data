You roll your head to the side, and chance the opening of an eye.\nA disfigured corpse lies on the table across from you.\nYou bolt upright, taking in your surroundings. A large room. A pickled smell. A few hanging lights. Corpses. Several. And the loud clock, ticking away, reading 3:42pm.\nYou realize, with some concern, that you are in a morgue.\nYou tear yourself off a cold stone table, and take a moment to catch your breath and make sure you are not merely in a nightmare. Unfortunately, this is all too real.]\nSitting just by your table are your belongings, haphazardly laid out on trays labeled with your name and a date. As you find some small comfort in dressing, your eyes wander to the other tables.\nThe corpses are in terrible shape. Their veins are a sickly emerald hue, and their flesh is… warped. Limbs at odd angles, features displaced. The worst, a huge and grotesque thing, seems to have been mixed up with parts from a deer. You shiver to think of what might have damaged the human body in this way.\nBefore you have the chance to consider further, a gunshot fires off from a nearby room. You whip your head around and see, to your dismay, that the door has several pieces of furniture piled against it. Worse, a strange gas swirls slowly in from under the door. A gas the same green shade as the veins of the bodies.\nThis is going to be one of those days."
