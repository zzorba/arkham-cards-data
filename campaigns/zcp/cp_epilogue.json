But your hunger for carnage only grew, and your will only diminished.\nYou told yourself you had to do it. And besides, he was a drifter - nobody would miss him. But once you had taken one life, it became all the easier to take another.\nWhen they found your stash of bodies, you were long gone. Which brought you to your ignoble position. Squatting in the sewers, crushing rats between your teeth just to feel the blood drip down.\nThe light of a flashlight shines in your eyes, and you hiss up at the hulking figure holding it. As you rear up to strike, you realize the man before you has no head on his shoulders. But in one hand, he holds a head that you just barely recognize. The head begins to speak.\n\"Disgusting. It's a travesty - West making us this way, then just letting us fall apart.\nHow do you feel about a little revenge?\""
