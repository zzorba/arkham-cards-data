It has a comically long nose and a strange symbol scrawled in yellow on its forehead. \"So, she calls it in. My boys and I picked him up on the corner of Saltonstall & Garrison.\" The sheriff's jaw clenches and his brows furrow as he recounts the story. \"Fella did nothing but laugh as we slapped the bracelets on him. Called himself Zanni. Said nothing except the 'carnival is coming'; whatever the hell that meant. Wasn't until the next day we found the victim's body. Defense wanted him in a straitjacket. We were happy to oblige.\"\nThere isn't much time to spare. If your research is right, there is more to this case than meets the eye.

You nod and drag yourself onto the docks from his gondola, drenched and aching all over. The city is devastated. Most of the boats in the canal are wrecked. The streets are covered not in confetti, but in blood.",

The chanting in the city plunges into mournful silence. As you return to the canal-side streets, black feathers fall from the sky where bright confetti once fluttered. You can only wonder how long it will take for the creature to recover.",
