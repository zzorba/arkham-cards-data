      "text": "September 1926.\nYou have just witnessed the resounding trial of Dr. Nadelmann, a person close to you, who was the rising star of the Department of Anthropology at Miskatonic University. Nadelmann is the only living member of the science expedition, launched to explore a wild valley in north-western Canada called North Hanninah. Sylvia Davidson, Norman Falkner and Bernard Epstein, the three newly graduated students who accompanied the anthropologist, have disappeared. The Arkham authorities were keen to ensure that justice was done, and Dr. Nadelmann was found guilty of involuntary homicide. However, everyone was able to see during the testimony that Nadelmann's physical and mental health were severely deteriorated. An ugly throat wound, which still had not healed after weeks, prevented Nadelmann from speaking normally. When Nadelmann's words could be understood, they were implausible rants, full of man-eating monsters and local spirits that doomed the expedition. After the judgment, mystery remained as to the real fate of the students, and Nadelmann was to leave for the Arkham Asylum to receive proper care pending a possible appeal of the trial.\nStanding in front of the court, as you meditate on the best way to prove Nadelmann innocent and rehabilitate the anthropologist’s name, many relatives of the missing students come to find you. Just like you, they are not satisfied with this judgment that has not shed light on the fate of their loved ones. They tell you that the Canadian Mounted Police stopped the investigation after the disappearance of many of their men. They are desperate, and ask you to find the three students, knowing that as a close friend of Dr. Nadelmann, you have access to all the information in Nadelmann's possession, and that they will provide you with all the support necessary to discover the truth.\nSoon after, you follow the footsteps of the previous expedition, starting by train from Arkham to Central Canada. During the trip you read Dr. Nadelmann's expedition notebook. Nadelmann's records are clear and precise at the beginning of the adventure. Several entries later, Nadelmann notes that the Sarcee guide of their expedition, Charlie Foxtail, abandoned the group after seeing the tracks of a being that Charlie called “The Wendigo”. Then the information quickly becomes confusing, the writing becomes increasingly jerky, unreadable. As it stands, you are not able to make sense of the disaster that supposedly befell the expedition. There are nonetheless enough interesting and concrete leads to begin your investigation.\nOnce at the terminus of the train, you are heading towards the Mackenzie River. Your destination is Fort McDonald, an outpost of the Mounted Police, which will give you access to the wild valley of North Hanninah. The weather is still good on the river bank, however higher up, in the mountains, the cold and the snow begin to settle. You have a short time before the arrival of winter to discover the truth about Dr. Nadelmann's disastrous expedition."
