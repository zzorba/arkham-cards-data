      "text": "A book publisher approaches the investigators and offers them some cash to help research a part of Justin Geoffrey's life. Justin Geoffrey was a promising young poet who reportedly died in a European madhouse recently. The publisher would like the investigators to unearth the reasons Geoffrey had for composing his bizarre and masterful swansong, a disturbing book of poetry entitled \"People of the Monolith.\" Some say that this poetry collection eventually caused the poet's death.\nThe publisher knows that Geoffrey was traveling somewhere in Hungary then, but the only clue to his destination is the word \"Xuthltan,\" mentioned in his final letter to his agent. The publisher has been unable to locate this place-name on any map of Hungary. The publisher would like the investigators to write descriptions of the area Geoffrey traveled, gather information about Geoffrey from residents who may remember him, as well as draw or photograph the countryside and any other particulars that may have prompted the mad poet to write his final poems. For this, the publisher offers mystery, adventure, and $500 cash. What's not to like?\nResearch in several books, including Dostmann's 1809 \"Remnants of Lost Empires,\" Dornly's \"Magyar Folklore,\" and Rachismoff's \"Back Roads of Hungary\" leads the investigators to a sleepy village called Stregoicavar in a low valley of Bicske, Hungary. The village's original Goth residents were long ago exterminated in Hunnish conquest, but the hamlet was eventually reclaimed by Boris Vladinoff in the 1526 Battle of Schomvaal, where the Hungarian general conquered the Mohammedan forces of Suleiman the Magnificent. Since then, the village has maintained a meager and obscure existence, albeit haunted by legends and tales of the tremendous bloodshed that once occurred there.\nOn the uncomfortable three-day coach ride from Bicske, the driver points out a mossy ruin to one side and explains that it is the tomb of Count Boris Vladinoff who was killed by the Turks centuries ago. Just an off-handed remark for a bit of color, yet for a moment the dreadful past of the region seems not so distant."

The legends say he is buried with a manuscript documenting what the Turks found in this valley!\nThree nights later, you unearth the discovery. Boris Vladinoff is buried where everyone says, and with his bones is a sealed lacquered box containing a yellowed parchment written in Turkish by Selim Bahadur. It tells of what he and his raiders found in the valley of Xuthltan, and the details align uncannily with what you witnessed on midsummer's night. You no longer doubt any of your recollections, nor the crazed utterings of Justin Geoffrey, nor the dire warnings recorded in certain ancient and forbidden texts. Since reading what Selim Bahadur wrote, you know for certain that man was not always master of the earth. And is he now?",

By then, it was no longer midsummer night, and yet still the Stone lurked mute and ominous, and the valley throbbed with breathless intensity. Yet by then you sensed that the moment had passed. Whatever secrets the Stone had long held, it would keep. You left the valley with no trace of Justin Geoffrey's visit to the Black Stone, nor was the poet himself ever heard from again. As with any poet, his poems alone must memorialize him.\nYou were compensated and thanked by your employer for your pictures and notes of the valley, which are indisputably accurate and clear.
