A single officer stands in front of the station at rapt attention -- one that you knew would be waiting for you.  Tetsuo Mori is a fairly new face in Arkham, but he has quickly earned a reputation for his diligence and bravery. Despite this reputation and his position within the police force, he has asked for your assistance on this specific evening. Tetsuo bows forward deliberately at your approach. His eyes glint with recognition, but his face remains stiff and serious.\n\"Thank you for agreeing to help. I know that you are busy, but this is a matter of the utmost importance, and one that I sadly cannot trust to my colleagues -- not all of them, that is to say.\" Tetsuo turns toward the station, brow knit with anxiety. \"A body was brought to the station last night. It was never identified, but that is the least troubling part. The next day, I discovered that the body had been dismembered savagely, as if torn apart.  Only my fellow officers could have accessed the body in the morgue. I called you here tonight because each of the five men who were on duty that night are on duty tonight as well. One of them must be responsible, and I must protect the others against that one. I am counting upon your skills to uncover the truth.\""
