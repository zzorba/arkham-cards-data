For everything that you wouldn't do, however, there are people like Olive McBride. The young woman's curiosity and fascination with true magic has led her to some crazy things in the past, so when she came to you about being in over her head, it had to be serious.\n\"Look, I've done blood magic before,\" Olive huffs, talking as if this could happen to anyone, \"It was one of the first kinds of magic I ever did! So when these fellas started going on about old blood rituals, I thought I already knew where this was going. What they did seemed kind of familiar, but there was something of about it.\" Olive idly rubs the scars on her arms from habitual spellcasting.\"I've used blood as a ritual component before, but they were making the blood move like it was alive. I could feel my own blood crawling under myskin when they were chanting, like it was trying to get out on its own. I called the whole thing off, and the guy in charge looked disappointed, but just packed up and left without a word.\" You press Olive for details on the sorcerers, and she nods. \"I did a little more magic after they left. A scrying spell this time. They made straight for Black Cave, and started preparingfor an even bigger ritual. I'd bet my soul that it's gonna be bad.\""

The remaining sorcerers who had already begun to flee at the loss of their leader are struck down by the arcing magic, and their implements destroyed from the feedback.  Everything goes white, until finally your senses fade back in, finding yourself lying on the stone cave floor next to the now-placid pool of blood.  \"That was incredible!\" Olive exclaims as she recovers alongside you, \"I've never felt anything like that before.  Maybe there's something to their kind of blood magic!\"  You give her a baffled look but she doesn't seem to notice it.  \"Look, there's even some of that crazy living blood left!\"  Olive feels around until she finds a glass vial to scoop up the still-roiling blood, grinning excitedly as she holds it up.  \"I'll bet you could do some equally crazy things with this blood.  Wouldn't hurt to try, would it?\"",
