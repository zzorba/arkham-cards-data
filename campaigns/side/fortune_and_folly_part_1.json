In addition to the unlucky patron being struck down mere moments after leaving the casino with his winnings, others have also met grisly yet improbable fates either within or nearby. Upon inquiring further, it seems that this casino appeared quickly and unexpectedly, and the authorities in Monaco have been suspiciously tight-lipped about where exactly it came from and who owns it. Since its opening, the casino has been a magnet for the unnatural and implausible. The more you learn, the more it seems worth at least taking a look to determine whether these events are simply coincidence, or the result of something much more sinister."

Isamara is not just an employee there, she is the \"Flor de Nicaragua,\" a singer whose performances have become a major draw for the casino. She has reputedly reached out to various parties for help over the course of the past month, concerned with some of the events she has witnessed behind the scenes. The Foundation has reason to believe a Key may be involved in these strange events. You find a table in the casino lounge, and wait for an opportune moment to attract her attention. Only a few minutes later, a woman in a striking red dress takes the stage. Her performance is so captivating that she is already leaving the stage before you remember why you are here. There is no doubt that she is the one you are looking for. As she glances at the crowd, you give a small wave. At first, she appears to take little notice, but then her eyes fall to the flower that you were told to wear. She approaches your table and sits down. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"If you were sent by Them, its not safe to talk here. Meet me in an hour.\" She hands you a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance!\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. Hope to see you again soon!\""

Clearly, she is worried about someone recognizing her. \"You're right to be suspicious about what's happening at Défis,\" she begins, wasting no time with pleasantries. \"On the surface, it's a casino like any other. But there's more going on than anyone could guess, Behind the scenes, a cult called the Fortune's Chosen are the ones that really run the show. They are deadly and dangerous. Anyone who has gotten too close to the truth or crossed the casino in some way has met a horrible fate.\"\nYou ask about the casino owner, and how involved he is with this cult. Isamara gives a mirthless smile. \"Abarran? He is their leader. Not just that, he is the worst of them all. He brought the casino here, but more importantly, he brought the Wellspring.\"\nIsamara explains that the vault of the casino holds a strange and powerful relic of mysterious origin. It is this relic that is responsible for the unlikely events that seem to pop up around the casino. This item is known as the Wellspring of Fortune, and it has the power to manipulate probability and luck. Abarran guards it jealously, as whoever possesses the Wellspring is able to turn fortune to their cause, no matter how selfish and destructive that cause may be. Over time, he has created the loyal cadre of the Fortune's Chosen by granting them some measure of the benefits of the Wellspring. They have come to revere it almost as a god. These true believers can be easily distinguished from the regular casino employees by the distinctive coin medallions they wear around their necks. \"Abarran trusts me for some reason, and he's even offered me to join. I think he views me as a potential asset,\" Isamara mutters.\nYou ask Isamara what she would have you do. \"Steal the Wellspring. Take it far away from here. I don't know how to say it more plainly. As long as it is in Abarran's grasp, he will use it to aggrandize himself. Even worse, I fear that the longer its powers are used, the greater the chance of harm coming to those in the casino. Who knows what seemingly impossible catastrophes it may summon if it is not removed?\"\nHer words seem not so much a plea for help as a call to action. You find yourself agreeing to the task almost without conscious thought. As you move to stand, she stops you with her hand.\n\"One last thing: do not underestimate Abarran. He is a dangerous man. He puts on a face of civility to the world, but underneath that mask there is a barely contained anger that can explode if he feels his prize is threatened. I've seen his temper, and I don't doubt it could drive him to tear a man limb from limb with his bare hands if he felt he had the cause.\" Left with that cheery thought, you begin planning a heist with the highest stakes."
