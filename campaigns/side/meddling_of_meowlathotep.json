What could a cat be doing way out here?\nYour question is answered when the creature is picked up by a robed human outside the manor house of the Barkham Hisstorical Society, an organization devoted to educating the populace about the “noble” cats of the city. It makes sense that such a reviled cult would be involved in this plot. The human brings the cat indoors, presumably to feed it and give it treats and such. Your blood boils. Curse you, foul cat! How dare you trick these humans into thinking you are cute and fluffy and not at all evil—!"

You patrol the area until you spot several panicked rats scurrying from a nearby sewer drain.\n“What’s the matter?” you bark. They chitter and chirp in response, and it is only then that you remember that rats can’t talk. Still, you glean some of their story from their frantic pantomiming. The Order of Dead Rodents at the Doorstep, as evidenced by their very namesake, has been hunting rats for ages. But now it is not just cats hunting them, but horrid cat-abominations that defy all earthly logic. Sounds like the Order is up to its old tricks once again…"

As you turn away from Velma’s, you spot a streak of cat-fur dipping gracefully out of sight. Using your keen sense of smell, you keep a tight pursuit as the cat winds its way west to Tailside, where Barkham’s train station can be found.\nYou follow the cat to the tracks on the western edge of town, where it ducks underneath an abandoned train car marked with a cat’s paw print. “Meowsachusetts Catnip Co.” reads the label beneath the logo. A front for a cult headquarters, no doubt. You are about to eavesdrop on the cats’ refuge when suddenly, a creature bursts forth from underneath the train! It is a hideous hybrid of bird, bat, and cat, with webbed paws and membranous wings notably lacking in fur, though its face is unmistakably feline. The sight of the thing makes your fur stand on end."
