All of the events were seemingly connected to some entity named Shub-Niggurath.\nAlthough the event resulted in the tragic loss of some lives, lzzie was not one of them. She had disappeared in the final moments, pursued or dragged off by the last remaining cult members.\nIt has taken every resource you had left, but at long last you have stumbled upon some evidence-evidence that suggests that lzzie may still be in trouble.

Mrs. Olmstead takes your hand and leads you to the center of the amphiteatre. Your friends move to stop you, but you shake your head, and they understand. It is your choice. You feel a pressure; the pitch of a staccato of measure leaves you reeling. You cannot even focus on the god forsaken music. The last thing that you think is that they probably never needed the music anyway.\nIsabelle wakes up hours later. She does not remember how she got to this place. A strange man in a green cloak explains that Jenny took your place in the ritual.\nYou don't understand why she would do that, but her friends tell you it is true. What happened after, they refuse to say. Some things we are better off not knowing. You're not sure what to do. You consider what Jenny would do.
