All of the events were seemingly connected to some entity named Shub-Niggurath.\nAlthough the event resulted in the tragic loss of some lives, lzzie was not one of them. She had disappeared in the final moments, pursued or dragged off by the last remaining cult members.\nIt has taken every resource you had left, but at long last you have stumbled upon some evidence-evidence that suggests that lzzie may still be in trouble. You finally know exactly where they have taken her.\nThere ain't nothing that's gonna stop you from finding lzzie now. Those Green Men goons won't know what hit 'em."

You knew it might come to this. How can you fight what you can't even see?\nThe Heralds that you had bribed earlier see to the care of Izzie as she is slowly awakened from her trance. Mrs. Olmstead takes your hand and leads you to the center of the amphiteatre. Your friends move to stop you, but you shake your head, and they understand. It is your choice. You feel a pressure; the pitch of a staccato of measure leaves you reeling. You cannot even focus on the god forsaken music. The last thing that you think is that they probably never needed the music anyway.\nIsabelle wakes up hours later. She does not remember how she got to this place. A strange man in a green cloak explains that Jenny took your place in the ritual.\nYou don't understand why she would do that, but her friends tell you it is true. What happened after, they refuse to say. Some things we are better off not knowing. You're not sure what to do. You consider what Jenny would do. And the answer comes to you, she'd do what she could.",

Your sister no longer suffers, and you had not known any better. Bitterly, you wonder what you could have done differently. Which of your many decisions has led you down this path?\nIt is weeks before you realize that the Green Man cult has been eradicated. That, in the end, it was a decision made for the greater good.
