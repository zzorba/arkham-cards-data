The adrenaline rush of going all in and risking everything on the mercy of the cards is also a nice perk. Lately it feels as though life has dealt you a bad hand, but you’re often able to turn terrible hands into winning ones. Who needs skill when Lady Luck is on your side?\nYour game of choice is blackjack. Somehow the right cards tend to come up at the right time, and you try to hide your elation when the dealer busts yet again. You seem to go on a hot streak every night as stacks of chips grow ever taller in front of you. Such hot streaks go a long way in paying your debts, but your luck often draws the ire of both the dealer and fellow players alike. You know when to stop.\nOver the years, you’ve acquired a reputation for winning that some call “cheating.” As a result, you’ve been forced to keep a low profile and gamble at a rotating list of venues. There is one venue which you revel winning at over all others: the Clover Club. Vast amounts of money are at stake every night at the speakeasy, but it’s controlled by the O’Bannion gang. Intimidating. Unscrupulous. Ruthless. No one wants to draw the attention of the gang, as your reputation surely does.\nBut the Clover Club has a bottom line that, above all else, must be maintained. The brazen O’Bannions are not fond of being taken advantage of, and will use any means necessary to prevent it. Here, the house always wins.\nSurely that will change tonight. You pull your collar up and walk into La Bella Luna. The restaurant is virtually empty. A faint sound of bombastic music is coming from the back of the establishment. It’s clear where all the patrons are. All you can think about is getting a drink and winning big…"
