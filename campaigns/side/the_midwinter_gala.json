Several other guests— some of the finest movers and shakers from Arkham to New York— flitter past you to present their invitations to the doorman. As you follow them in, you catch a scent of cedar and sweet florals, with an undercurrent of something rank.\n\"The Lantern Club is thrilled to have you,\" a grinning, sharp-eyed attendant says as they hand you the same bone-white mask worn throughout the soirée. Feeling out of place, you don your mask and follow an elderly flapper into a drawing room with a crackling fire. The room would be warm and inviting if not for an uncanny strangeness in the dreamlike paintings and ghastly sculptures.\nLooking at them makes your head swim.\n\"Please, please, if you'll indulge me.\" A stentorian voice bellows from an adjoining room. You follow the voice back to the lavish foyer. At the top of the stairway, a stately gentleman with a finely trimmed beard and alabaster mask raises his champagne glass.\n\"I am Declan Pearce, nomarch of the Lantern Club. Follow me please.\" The guests follow him through a wide set of double doors into the ballroom, in the center of which a gleaming gem is displayed behind a thick pane of glass. The socialites gather around, marveling at the swirling, iridescent colors that move like clouds within the hard cut angles of the Jewel.\n\"My honored guests. This is the Jewel of Sarnath,\" Declan Pearce says triumphantly. \"A stone unlike any other, rumored to have been cut in an ancient city on distant shores. Legends claim it can grant its bearer's wishes.\" Scattered laughter follows Pearce's remark, and the chairman himself suppresses a chuckle. \"Yes, yes, I know. Of course, the real purpose of this evening is you. We invited only the best, the most supreme of New England's social strata, to appeal to your sense of charity. The most distinguished - or generous - among you may be permitted to hold the Jewel by the end of the evening. And who knows? Perhaps dreams are real, and the Jewel of Sarnath can grant wishes. But until then, enjoy our little party.\"\nAfter another wave of friendly laughter, Pearce claps his hands and a dozen attendants bearing mouth-watering appetizers descend upon the room. Your eyes scan the ballroom, hoping for some sign of the contact who led you here. A chill runs down your spine as you lock eyes with a tall, masked figure standing at the back of the crowd. He slowly cocks his head just a little too far to the right. You wonder if he is smiling behind his bone-white mask.\nAfter what feels like ages, the man breaks eye contact with you to continue scanning the room. Suppressing a shiver, you search the gaggle of guests. Your gala invitation arrived in an unmarked parcel, along with a note promising generous compensation for your assistance in procuring the Jewel of Sarnath. At long last, you find your mysterious contact."
