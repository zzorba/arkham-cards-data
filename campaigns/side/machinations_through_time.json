      "text": "The newspaper headline reads, \"Local scientists win Nobel Prize!\" Below it, two elderly physicists are pictured standing proudly in front of a large telescope. You glance at the newspaper's date, your jaw agape. This issue of the <i>Arkham Advertiser</i> is dated December 5, 1956. But how is this possible?\nSurprised and curious, you eagerly read the entire newspaper and learn of two remarkable scientists and their journey to winning a Nobel Prize in physics.\nBorn in 1877 in Arkham to Irish immigrants, Thomas Corrigan's earliest memory is when his crayons, left on an outdoor table, melted together under the hot summer sun. From then on, his curiosity and thirst for knowledge grew more rapidly than his height. His wonder at the world around him, from fierce New England thunderstorms to the canvas of stars in the night sky, fueled his passion for the sciences.\nThomas' desire to attend Miskatonic University is almost as old as his love for learning, as its acclaimed College of Sciences and close proximity made it a natural choice. After getting degrees in undergraduate physics and graduate astrophysics at Miskatonic, he began working at the University's Warren Observatory researching astronomical objects and phenomena.\nBorn in 1877 in Warsaw, Poland, Mary Zielinski is the youngest child of two teachers. She has fond memories as a little girl helping her mother with cooking and baking, using cups and teaspoons to measure a variety of ingredients, then mixing those ingredients together to create something entirely new. Thereafter, she began experimenting on her own, which propelled her down the path of chemistry and physics.\nImpressed with Mary's credentials, Miskatonic University offered her a full scholarship. Quiet and introverted, she spent much of her time in the laboratories of the Science building doing various experiments. Her hard work and dedication earned her an undergraduate chemistry degree, and she stayed on at the University to achieve a graduate degree in physics.\nHaving common interests, Thomas and Mary eventually became acquainted and a relationship followed. Their shared passion for the sciences encouraged and motivated each other, and they collaborated on several projects.\nYears later, one of their most intriguing projects took off: the possibility of a whole new paradigm based on general relativity, which connects the curvature of spacetime to gravity. They began testing the theory that spacetime could be warped, resulting in a discontinuity. Such a warping could result in portals that lead to distant places across the universe, or even to their own location in another era—in effect, time travel.\nThis type of groundbreaking work drew the attention of colleagues from campus and beyond. One of these associates was the brilliant and eccentric Edwin Bennet. A rapidly rising star in the field of quantum physics, Edwin became a professor at his alma mater, Miskatonic University. Young and unpublished, he was eager to prove his knowledge would be invaluable to their project, but others on campus expressed substantial concerns, labeling him as \"reckless\" and \"unstable.\"\nAfter hitting multiple barriers and looking for inspiration, Thomas and Mary welcomed Edwin's offer to collaborate, and the team was confident they were on the verge of a breakthrough—but it never came. It's unclear what exactly transpired next, though some sort of disagreement or conflict resulted in Edwin being replaced by an even more eccentric scientist, Ezra Graves. Thomas and Mary acknowledged and thanked Edwin for his role in their research.\nEzra's boundless creativity was integral to Thomas and Mary's new approach to their problems, and this fresh perspective allowed them to overcome the barriers. While Ezra soon moved on to his own projects, his contributions were invaluable and greatly appreciated.\nOver the years, Thomas and Mary's research progressed with success after success, culminating in the discovery of teleportation. They published their remarkable findings on February 23, 1955, to much acclaim. And now—or rather, thirty years from now—they are being awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics.\nThough suspect, your intuition tells you this mysterious newspaper is real. In awe of the future notoriety two local scientists will eventually receive, you go to Miskatonic University to meet them. However, you're informed they are not affiliated with the University and, tragically, both of them disappeared years ago.\nUnbeknownst to the rest of the world, a momentous change has occurred. Prominent scientists have vanished without a trace. Notable inventions have become un-invented. A historic discovery has suddenly been undiscovered. Humanity may never be the same.\nYou believe you know the truth, even if it's stranger than fiction. You're quite familiar with the notion of portals—you've been through them yourself. For unknown reasons, Arkham, Massachusetts is rife with such portals, but traveling through them is dangerous and not for the faint of heart.\nWithin these portals lies the realm of Tindalos, where countless suspended paths, angular and curved, above and below, wind away in all directions. Here and there, they intersect with ramps and spirals. Prowling along these paths are malevolent minions: ghastly satyrs and Hounds of Tindalos, among other monstrosities. The beasts are eager to savage their prey, or, perhaps worse, abduct and imprison them in Tindalos.\nThere has been a distortion in time, and its effects have rippled across the ensuing years. These scientists are two such unfortunate souls, and you'll have to find them and repair the broken timeline. Just remember: traveling through time may cause unintended consequences, some of which will have severe repercussions."
