They ramble on about the people they loved, or their job, or the money they hid under the floorboards before they died. Usually it’s about food or drink. The dead are always hungry. Sometimes when they realize you can hear them, they crowd ’round real close and whisper in your ear. Last wishes and such. You try to help when you can, but usually the folks they want you to take care of are dead, too. You make a lot of empty promises, but at least it keeps them quiet.\nIt wasn’t always this way. The dead started talking the day your father died in his shotgun house in the French Quarter. You saw him standing over his own body in the living room when you came home; he vanished before you could say a word. From then on, whenever you played your father’s trumpet, you could hear a cacophany of voices. Some of them were human. But there were others, too. Piercing wails from inhuman lips. Gutteral cries. And a crowd of shimmering, spectral faces peering out from the shadows.\nJean helped you make sense of it all. He stopped to listen to you busking on a Bourbon Street corner and noticed the long look you gave to the ghost lying at your feet. He saw it too. Jean introduced himself as a medium and told you to meet him at his shop in Broadmoor. He told you all about the dead, and the things beyond the grave, and the price you’d pay if you kept company with ’em for too long.\nIt was the dead who led you to Arkham. You eke out a living playing your father’s trumpet. The dead get louder when you play. Sometimes they even compliment your music. Last night, Jean found you busking outside the Clover Club, almost like the first time you met. You could tell something was wrong: his face was haggard, and he looked like he hadn’t slept for days. Jean tells you that your father wants to see you, and that you need to go where the boundary between here and thereafter is thin. You tell him you know just the place. Hangman’s Hill is rife with spirits. Maybe if you do them a few favors, they’ll do you one in return."
