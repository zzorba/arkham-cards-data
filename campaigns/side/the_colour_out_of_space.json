When she told you the science team returned empty handed after being threatened and attacked by the town’s stable master despite his previous promises of unfettered access to the meteor, you wondered what she was getting at. That the assault was not the extent of Eastwick’s aberrant behaviour and that it was not limited to the folk left a sinking sensation in your stomach. When she asked you if you would do her a personal favour and look into the town it had felt inevitable.\nUpon arriving in Eastwick, you find a town suffering a quiet degeneracy. The town looks almost abandoned. Doors and windows look hastily boarded up and an eerie glow rolls up over the hills and across the town. You’ll have to try and find some willing townsfolk to make any inroads."
