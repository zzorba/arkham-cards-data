Your hands are pressed into coarse sand, and every few seconds you feel cold water lapping at your fingertips. After what feels like minutes you open your eyes again to see the tall spires of that ancient city, reaching up to a sky lit with black stars. The violin is now joined by an unseen orchestra, reaching a deafening crescendo. You try to rise from your knees, but your shaking legs give out, and you fall onto your back…\n…and land on the dusty wooden boards of a stage. The sound of your collapse echoes off of the cavernous walls of the Ward Theatre. You stare up at the dark ceiling above as you lie on the proscenium. The soloist is gone. The monsters are gone. The Theatre is dark and seemingly abandoned, save for you.\nYou rise slowly, then turn and flee, not wanting to look for any signs of your experience. You are convinced that this place is cursed, that the production is cursed, and that this curse will haunt you for the rest of your days.\nAs you push through the front doors of the theatre and back out into the street, you hear the haunting melody in your head once more…",
