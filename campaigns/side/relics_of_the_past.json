You lash the whip at an exposed tree root near the ceiling, and start your swing.\nWith a heart-wrenching crack, the root snaps under your weight and you plummet into the chasm. You bounce off of sharp rocks as you tumble down, eventually landing in a shallow stream at the bottom. You spit blood, and then look up to see the eyes of the serpent-people peering down at you from far above, before they retreat back the way they came.\nYou struggle to stand, and consider the stream at your feet.
