      "text": "Over a decade after the Great War, another kind of war has come to Earth—a conflict wrought by factions long hidden in the shadows of society.\nIt began with the murders in Arkham—over a dozen bodies in half as many days. The police thought the perpetrator to be a serial killer at first, until the sixth victim's corpse turned up as a mangled heap of meat and viscera, like a meal chewed up and spit back out. No human could have performed such a grisly murder.\nWhen similar killings started to sprout up in other cities across North America, you sought to uncover the truth. A serial killer could not be in Arkham, Providence, Montréal, and New York City all at once. This had to be the work of an organization. But that wasn't all you discovered: there were commonalities between many of the victims, sorting them into three distinct groups.\nIn Providence, many victims were older and well-educated. In Montréal, those killed lived in the woods outside the city, or had professions dealings with nature or biology in some capacity. In New York, bodies turned up deep in the sewers and underground subway tunnels, their identities shrouded in mystery.\nYou have spent the past few weeks trying to unearth the truth behind these murders and the various factions carrying them out. In this time, the conflict has grown exponentially. Massacres. Bombings. Sightings of strange ceremonies in the streets. Entities blotting out the stars in the night sky. Swarms of locust-like insects devouring people whole. Mutated lizard creatures prowling the sewers. And worse yet, while Arkham seems to be conflict's epicenter, these incidents are spreading all across the world.\nThis is no ordinary war, and not one the authorities can deal with. You are the only one who suspects the truth. Somehow, you have to find out what these factions are fighting over, and put a stop to the conflict before it consumes the entire world in its madness."

Otherworldly though they may be, the insects are insects nonetheless, and many hives have among them a queen. Using all of your ingenuity, you devise a plan to crush the queen and thereby scatter the swarm.\nTo your surprise, your plan works. With the queen dispatched, the swarm is aimless, its hunger replaced by a sense of desperation and panic. It is not long before the myriad creatures descend once more into the pit whence they came. Perhaps another queen will come to unite them, but you will seal that accursed pit long before that happens. For now, Earth is safe.",

Using the rituals of its own cult against it, you devise a spell of such incandescent heat that not even the emptiness of space can devour it. When your rite is unleashed, the mists retreat in anguish, letting out no sound but the shrill hiss of air being sucked through a vacuum.\nYou observe the sky in fear, hoping that the mist does not return the moment your ritual has ended. Minutes pass. Then hours. Familiar stars once more fill the night sky. Perhaps the entity is gone for good. If the notes of the creature's many observers are true, it will likely return in the future—maybe hundreds or thousands of years from now. You may have saved the Earth this day, but the understanding of the entity's true nature haunts you still.",
