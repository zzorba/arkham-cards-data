Cameras and props have gone missing, and a series of accidents nearly halted production. Rumors have spread between the cast members that the films are “cursed.” None of it was taken seriously until one of the cast members was found dead.\nThe late afternoon sun beats down on the hot pavement as you scan the crowd for signs of André. Half a dozen extras in alien masks whisk past you, followed by a stagehand dragging a large dinosaur foot by wagon. Across the lot, you finally spot him standing with a trio of werewolves. His eyes light up, and he strides briskly through the busy lot once he sees you.\n“Finally!” he takes a bow. “I thought you’d never arrive. And just in time, too! Please, follow me.” As the silent film star leads you across the lot, you catch glimpses of the various sets. <i>A Cosmic Journey</i> features a cheap-looking rocket, a robed wizard, and alien “Saturnites.” Meanwhile, <i>The Forgotten Island</i> is filled with crudely painted pyramids and gargantuan paper mache dinosaurs. A bloodcurdling scream echoes out of the gothic horror set for <i>The Abominable Contessa</i> as you walk past.\n“I don’t think the mishaps lately are just bad luck,” André says gravely. “Unfortunately, my reputation has made it difficult to get a straight answer out of the cast and crew. Nobody wants to tell their star actor that something’s going wrong on set. Which is why I need you to ask around the film sets. See what they think is really going on.”\nAndré’s demeanor brightens. “This could be quite fun, actually. I hope you’re up to the task.”"

According to some accounts, several fires have mysteriously broken out, each of them near the Helios Telescope. After several minutes of searching, a low metallic growl cuts through the silence, coming from the rocket ship. André puts one hand to the wooden hull. “It’s warm,” he says quietly. The vessel rattles as the film star opens the hatch.\nFollowing André inside, you feel your footsteps echo on solid metal. What you discover within defies explanation. The ship is far larger and more elaborate inside than out; its paneled walls are covered in metal tubes and glowing consoles. You follow André to a shattered lens cap lying on the floor. “This was part of the telescope, but where is the rest?” he asks. As if in answer, the rocket ship judders to life.\nYou rush to a glass porthole and look outside to see the emptiness of deep space, dotted with stars. André looks outside, disbelieving. “I don’t think we’re in Hollywood anymore.”"

According to André, one member of the production was found babbling on set with the film’s signature prop, the Staff of the Serpent, in hand. As you search for the prop, the ground begins to feel softer underfoot. Looking down, you see your shoe sinking in wet, loamy soil. The air has grown oppressively humid and is filled with the buzzing of cicadas and the cries of distant birds. You look up to see thick green leaves partially obscuring a bright blue sky. You are no longer in the jungle set but in the jungle itself.\n“What is this madness?” André wipes his brow, then jumps as a long snake slithers across his shoes and into the underbrush. Recoiling from the serpent, you look beyond to a serpentine path that leads deeper into the jungle. Someone—or something—retreated away from Lot C and ventured into this other world. Based on what you heard, the missing film prop seems to be at the heart of this strange phenomenon."

      "text": ": “Rumor has it that some of the actors on this production have gotten a little too into their performances. But there’s more. Just last week, an assistant was nearly strangled by the contessa’s Accursed Cape—although they weren’t even wearing it.” André says, leading you onto the set for <i>The Abominable Contessa</i>. A pale moon shines in a matte sky, casting long shadows on a field of graves. The backdrop depicts a moody gothic castle with towering spires, sneering gargoyles, and stained-glass windows. Your vision begins to swim as the scenery warps before your eyes. The castle and surroundings come into focus. You look up to see the set roof has disappeared, replaced by a starlit sky, and the walls have been replaced with a sprawling forest. Looming over all of it is the dark castle, suddenly real.\n“This is impossible,” André looks at the bleak landscape. Before you can reply, a howl breaks the stillness. Several nightmarish forms emerge from the nearby trees. Together, you dash up the hill to take refuge in the ominous castle. As the massive doors slam behind you, the sound of maniacal laughter echoes through the vast foyer. A gorgeous woman with pale skin and blood-red lips steps out from the shadows. She holds a large goblet in one hand. “Welcome to my humble home. I am Contessa Demetriou. I assume you are here for the banquet? Unfortunately, it is you who are on the menu!” Cackling, she vanishes in a cloud of bats.\nAs the sound of gnashing and clawing intensifies outside, André turns to you. “There’ve been some strange rumors on set about that cape, and now the Contessa is wearing it. Perhaps if we take it from her, we may be able to end…all of this,” he gestures at your surroundings."

I suppose we have much to discuss.” Erika nods along as the film star relays the strange and fantastical events of the day. After finishing the tale, André snatches his hat and cane from a nearby table. “I must go.
