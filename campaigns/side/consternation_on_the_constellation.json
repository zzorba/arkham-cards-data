The unmarked envelope had arrived just yesterday, promising a welcome solution to a vexing affair.\nIn the past few weeks, several collections of esoteric artifacts in Arkham have been ransacked, culminating in the murder of an employee of the Miskatonic Historical Society. Your contacts have informed you that similar burglaries have taken place in Boston, Innsmouth, and New York. Strangely, nothing has been reported missing as yet except for a few records and books. What could these people be looking for? You have a growing fear that it is something dastardly indeed.\nWith leads running dry, hopping aboard an ocean liner in response to a note from an unknown sender seems only one step above a wild goose chase, but it's the best chance you may get. With that in mind, you grab the tickets and head out the door."
