One of magick and majesty, of conquest and persecution. The moment you found that strange, old key—the moment you recognized the filigree along its handle, the pattern of its teeth—you knew those dreams weren’t dreams at all, but memories. Memories of another life. Of a place called “Hyperborea.” And as the memories returned, the magic did, too.\nFor months you practiced in secret, delving into your memories and honing your powers. But lately, your dreams have turned dark and grisly. Your former self was not as caring or forviging as you. She was ruthless. Power-hungry. Terrible to behold. You’ve taken it upon yourself to wield these strange powers only to help others, and not to hurt them.\nBut you’re not the only one whose memories have started to return. Elspeth Baudin first visited the diner a few weeks ago. In the beginning, she was just a patron like any other. She ordered eggs, bacon and a black coffee, not unlike many of the other customers at Velma’s. But there was something in her eyes— some spark of recognition or curiosity—that made you wary of her.\nThen came the questions.\nFirst, she asked about the key you wore on a chain around your neck. You gave her your best smile and told her your usual lie—that it was a family heirloom, a harmless trinket with no worth but its sentimental value. But that didn’t deter her. She started prying about your life, about your family…about your dreams.\nElspeth was no normal patron. She wasn’t making small talk. She was looking for answers, just the same as you. So you did some digging of your own. But there were no records of Elspeth being a resident of Arkham, and the few people you found who knew of her spoke only in hushed, frightened voices, and gave you very little to work with.\nThen came a call from the Curiositie Shoppe in Northside. Elspeth had been searching for more artifacts like your own “hierloom,” even going so far as to utter the name Hyperborea. She is searching for something that can unlock more of her memories, just like you…but she is <i>not</i> like you. That sinister smirk of hers, the way her contacts trembled with fear at the mention of her name—you shudder to think what somebody with foul intentions could do with the sort of powers your memories hold…"

True power is the ability to make peace, not the ability to wage war. “Fool,” she barks, clambering to her feet. “You are a weakling, after all. And you will regret letting me live.” You watch her amble off with only fragments of her former life in her head. Her powers are considerably drained, but she still poses a problem. Perhaps you should have dealt with her, as she said. Still, you breathe a sigh of relief. You don’t want this power to change who you are. You won’t let yourself become like her. No matter what.",
