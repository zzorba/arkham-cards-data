Your fascination with horror and the macabre earned you the nickname “Spooks” among your friends and classmates. But as you grew, so too did this fascination, until it bordered on obsession. Your appetite for horror evolved from mystery and make-believe to something more. Something <i>real</i>.\nWhen you discovered John Dee’s translation of The Necronomicon, you knew you’d finally found the true horror you had been secretly yearning for. If only you’d known what would be in store for you once you’d read that dreadful tome. You would have locked it back up in Henry Armitage’s restricted collection in the Orne Library and never opened it again.\nOr so you like to think. But even you cannot doubt the allure of the <i>Kitab al-Azif</i>. The Book of the Dead. That is why, when Dr. Armitage summoned you to the Orne Library, the dread in your bones predicted precisely what had occurred.\n“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” Dr. Armitage says as he surveys the destruction. The entire restricted collection is in tattered disarray. The Necronomicon lies open on a nearby table, its metal clasps broken apart. You run your fingers along its leathery, skin-like pages. Your eyes flit along the words in a familiar dance:\n<center><i>“They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness.”</i></center>\nYour throat tightens as you realize what must have occurred. Something has been unleashed, and you are the only one who can figure out how to stop it…"
