This time, she draws the Sandstorm treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Desert Oasis that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action. This time, she draws Nile River, which is connected to the Expedition Camp. Her exploration is successful.

      "text": "Xzharah places an ice-cold hand on your shoulder as you kneel before him. “You have proven your loyalty,” he decrees. Creatures of the abyss surround you, heads bowed in reverence to their new master. There are none left to oppose him. “Few of your kind have the wit or the will to see beyond the present. To see our prophecy fulfilled. But you are worthy enough to have your eyes opened. Far worthier than the fools I have trusted in the past.” He bids you to stand, and places the handle of his blood-soaked sword in your hands. “Now arise, Servant of the Beast, and take your place among us.”",
