You are surprised to see wooden docks on the side of the Miskatonic River. A few ducks quack in surprise and swim away from the nearest dock. Water sloshes along the shore. You hear dockworkers going about their business, their work day almost finished as the sun sets to your left. After taking a few steps, you collapse to the ground. You are too exhausted and injured to go on. “Who’s that?” a dockworker calls out. “Someone is hurt—quick, let’s get them to St. Mary’s!” You drift into unconsciousness just as a muscled man lifts you into his arms.\nYou wake up and realize you are in a strange place, with no memory of how you arrived. Your muscles are weak and uncooperative. Your vision is blurred. Simply rising to your feet takes a tremendous effort. Your legs are wobbly and can barely support your weight. A note on the ground nearby reads:\n<fancy>Greetings. I have gathered you here as an experiment. Think of this as a test of human will. You will survive. Or you will die…</fancy>",

His distorted voice is pained but proud. “I am everywhere and everywhen. This vessel is but one. There are others. And if even one of them is proven right, I will never truly die.” His body falls limply to the ground. Seeing an opportunity to escape, you rush to the iron doors sealing you in the warehouse. With a desperate effort, you are finally able to break the padlock and push open the heavy doors.\nA sudden gust of cold evening air sweeps over you.

What did he mean by “others?” You recall the strange visions you saw in his maze, and a terrible thought seeps into your mind. The kidnapper had mentioned other groups, but you were never able to find them, and you have no idea if they made it out alive. You tell the police there are others and insist that they search the docks, but there is no trace of the warehouse you had escaped, nor of the mastermind who trapped you there…",

The outline of his body twists and blurs, like a wrinkle in the fabric of space and time. “So, the ritual has failed!” His bitter cackle descends into a cry of pain. “Perhaps humanity has a chance after all. This agony, this suffering! Such power is not meant for humans to wield. It is for the ones beyond!” He gasps and wheezes, collapsing to the ground. “Do not follow the path I followed,” he begs, “it leads only to… despair.” His breathing stops.\nYou have somehow defeated your captor, but many questions remain. Deciding to explore the labyrinth further, you find a way to break open the iron doors leading into the other sections of the complex. To your surprise, you find no other victims trapped in the labyrinth—only signs of their struggles, and of their survival.\nIt takes only one solid strike to break open the padlock sealing the warehouse’s iron doors. The sound of metal slamming against metal is tripled in its volume. You do not believe your kidnapper meant for you to ever leave, but somehow you have defied the odds stacked against you. You wonder if the others are opening these heavy doors at this very moment, too.\nA sudden gust of cold evening air sweeps over you.
