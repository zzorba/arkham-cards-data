The elderly woman seats herself next to you, staring off in thought.  \"I suppose it all started with my late husband Charles Labranche, God rest him.  He led such an exciting life, you know, from fighting in the Civil War to sailing across the world.  Ah, but he had such a fondness for me.  When we were married, he promised that I'd always be provided for, and that's held true even thirty years after his passing.\"  You ask Madame Labranche if this business is about inheritance or some other oddity Charles left behind, but she shakes her head.\n\"You see, it's the strangest thing.  Whenever I've needed money for anything, I've always somehow had just the right amount around somewhere.  But lately, I've had too much!\"  You nod along, failing to see how this is a problem.  \"I didn't think much of it until just the other day, after I hadn't spent any money for some time.  I heard a clinking sound from the attic.  When I went up to see, there was an enormous pile of coins, with even more appearing out of thin air!  What's more, I saw figures lurking at the corners of the attic.  There's something bizarre up there.  Can you help to sort it out?\""

      "text": "The demon steps stoically into the drawn triangle, looking to you expectantly.  You demand a full explanation, and it nods, its voice now smoother than before.  \"Charles Labranche did bargain for wealth to sustain his dear wife after his passing.\"  Madame Labranche places a hand on her cheek with a flattered smile, but Shax continues.  \"In accordance to the ceremonial magic, wealth was drawn in certain amounts... which became unclear as the writing faded.\"  You see now that the demon took advantage of this and attempted to claim a soul for granting more than agreed.  Following the terminology you've figured out, you command the demon to repair the inscriptions, and make an allowance to Madame Labranche for this trouble.  The spirit sullenly complies before vanishing with a flash of fire.",
