You arrive at the Miskatonic Science Building right on schedule to find the researcher frantically -- and gleefully -- attending to a bizarre machine that fills half his lab.  He takes no notice of you at first, and you call out to him that you're here to help with 'something big,' as he phrased it in his letter. Dr. Maleson turns to you with a grin.  \"Oh, you'd better believe it's big!\" he chuckles, \"this could be the biggest breakthrough in all of physics!  Bigger than gravity, planetary motion, special relativity -- bigger than the atom!  Erm... well of course it's bigger than the atom, just about everything is, but you know what I'm getting at!\"\nYour confused stare lets Dr. Maleson know that he needs to actually explain.  \"Alright, picture this: You know how radios broadcast at different wavelengths, and you can tune in to specific frequencies?  Imagine if the universe as we know it -- everything that we can see, touch, et cetera -- was just a single frequency of reality?  Well, my machine is capable of turning that supposed radio knob!  We are going to open the door to an infinite amount of universes all overlapping ours!\"  He lets out a borderline maniacal laugh and shoves a stack of papers into your arms.  \"Here, I've done all the preliminary research.  This should get you up to speed.\""
