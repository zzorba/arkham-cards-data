Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round it was bad news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs and looks away.\n“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes in, putting a wrinkled hand on your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely remember anything else from that night.\nWhen you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst, you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find answers."
