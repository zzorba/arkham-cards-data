At first you imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a different picture.\nIt all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human."

If my instincts are correct, the assailants you’ve encountered will be searching for it. After all that transpired, I didn’t feel safe keeping it at the library, so I brought it to my good friend, Harold Walsted. He is the current curator of the Miskatonic Museum. I thought it would be safe in the museum’s Restricted Hall, but now I’m not so sure. You must retrieve it at all costs! I fear terribly what they could do with the rites contained in its pages…”"
