Can one even sleep in the Dreamlands? If so, where would their minds go? Curious, you pose this question to the cat.\n“Those here in their physical bodies can, but you are something else entirely. Now, never mind all that. On to business.” The black cat leaps onto your bed. “I gave your friends the warning you wanted me to pass along. They are preparing to enter the Dreamlands as well, it seems. In the meantime, I will stay with you. Somebody has to watch over you and my pet human, anyway.”"

Addressing Randolph, you suggest talking to the high priest Atal in the nearby Temple of the Elder Ones. It is a name you heard the last time you visited the city of Ulthar in your sleep, though until now you had no reason to seek the priest’s advice. Randolph gives you a startled glance that transforms quickly into a smirk.\n“How curious,” he says, “I was about to suggest the same. Atal is wise beyond all our measure. He may know where to find the place we seek.”\nVirgil, eager to embark on this adventure, claps his hands. “Well, what are we waiting for? This way, my friends!”\nYou nod and head for the temple, a circular tower of ivoried stone crowning the highest hill in town. A small army of cats patrols its walls. The cat at the head of the formation is none other than the old cat with the scar you encountered in the woods earlier. He steps forward to bar your entry and regards your party with great acrimony.\n“Hello again,” the old cat says with a sharp tone. “I suppose yeh want me to step aside.”"

Even I know not its true location. And that is all well and good, for the fruits of attempting to ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard from again. The gods of Kadath may seem powerless, but they are protected by the Other Gods from the Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. It would be wiser to let all the gods alone and leave this folly behind.”\nAtal’s use of the word “gods” has you curious. You wonder aloud what kind of god might exist in a place like this.\nThe priest shakes his head. “They are not our gods, but the gods of Earth, for this land is but a reflection of yours.”\nYou attempt to pry deeper into Atal’s wisdom with your questioning, but his advice does not budge. “I have already said more than I should,” he insists. “Please, for your sake, pursue this madness no further.”"

He tells of an image carved into the face of the mountain Ngranek on the isle of Oriab—the likeness of the gods, or so he claims. He tells of the pillars of Kadatheron wherein the history of Earth’s Dreamlands is recorded. He tells of those slain by the hordes of Night itself and interred in the crypts of Zulan-Thek, the city of the dead. He tells of a baleful star above a forgotten city that appears on no map. “If you absolutely must seek Kadath in the Cold Wastes,” he says drowsily, “there is a city along the coast to the south: Dylath-Leen. You may secure passage there.”"

In the meantime, your quest grows deadlier with each passing day. No matter where you go, foul, nightmarish creatures pursue you across land and sea. Winged beasts with no faces, horned Corsairs wielding razor-sharp cutlasses and commanding great black galleys—the agents of your demise bear many shapes. You decide to return to your ship, safe from the many dangers of the Dreamlands…or so you thought. Unfortunately, your ship is no safe haven. When you return, the crew and captain are nowhere to be found. There are no signs of struggle, but Virgil, who returned to the ship earlier to prepare for your next departure, is also missing.\n“I fear the worst,” Randolph mourns. “If those fiendish Corsairs captured them, they are in dire trouble. They are agents of the Other Gods from the Outside, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos <smallcaps>Nyarlathotep</smallcaps>.” The mere utterance of the name causes you to shudder, though you do not know why. You ask where they might have been taken. As if discussing any other port of call, he replies: “The beasts who command their black galleys sail from the Moon. If we are to rescue Virgil and our other companions, that is where we must go.”",
