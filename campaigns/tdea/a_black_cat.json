      "text": "<i>Following scenario 1–A, the dreamers travel beyond the Enchanted Woods…</i>\nAs you travel out of the Enchanted Woods, you pass through rolling green meadows under a bright-blue, cloudless sky. You speak with the blond-haired man—who introduces himself as Randolph Carter— for several hours along your journey south. You pass through a town Randolph calls Nir and over a stone bridge spanning a wide river. Since the man seems friendly and knowledgeable about both your world and this one, you explain to him your situation: that you had followed the writings of a man named Virgil Gray to reach this strange land, in order to see for yourself the truth of his story. “There is a place in Ulthar where you may yet meet this man for yourself,” Randolph responds. “When we reach Ulthar, I will show you.”\nThe town of Ulthar is not quite what you had imagined. The border of the town is marked by a cobblestone road separating its quaint cottages from the rolling green meadows beyond. Inside the town, narrow cobbled streets are filled almost to capacity with cats of all kinds and colors, which part as you approach. Old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories arch over the hilly streets; the entire village seems a haphazard cluster of homes and old-fashioned businesses. As you reach the town square near the center of the village, Randolph stops and addresses you with a youthful smile. “Welcome to Ulthar,” he proclaims. “As I mentioned before, you are quite safe here. There is but one paramount law to keep in mind as you traverse this place: in the town of Ulthar, no one may kill a cat.” Given how utterly packed the streets are with cats, you wonder aloud if this is indeed a town run by cats. “Not quite,” Randolph replies, pondering your words, “though I suppose one might call it the center of cat society here in the Dreamlands. The reason for that law’s existence is a story for another time. First, come—I have a feeling we’ll find this ‘Virgil’ fellow you speak of at Einar’s.”\nRandolph leads you through the town square, which is surrounded by buildings adorned with cat motifs in the form of statues, signs, and even stained-glass windows. You eventually arrive at one such building bearing a sign that reads “Einar’s Place.” Inside is a medieval-style tavern filled with long wooden tables. You spot several patrons and three times as many cats. One such patron at the wooden counter feeds one of the cats small strips of dried meat. He is a handsome man in his early thirties, with short dark hair, a strong jaw, and sharp cheekbones. You recognize him instantly as the writer Virgil Gray. In the back of your mind, you wonder if this chance meeting is merely an act of fortune or something preordained, for good or for ill.\nRegardless, you approach the man and introduce yourself, along with Randolph. Virgil shakes your hand and Randolph’s with a joyful smile. “Well met, fellow dreamers!” the writer says, a hint of boyish excitement in his voice. “It is wonderful to meet more fellow believers. I had become so sick and tired of reading about my supposed ‘illness’ in the papers.”\nYou nod your head in agreement and inform Virgil that you intend to find some proof of this discovery to bring back to the waking world. “Don’t you think I tried that?” he replies, stymied. “Sadly, it is impossible for one who is asleep to bring anything from this realm into the real world. This is all imagination, you see. Ideas, concepts, fantasies. You cannot hold a thought in your hands, can you?”\nRandolph interjects. “There is a place within the Dreamlands that may hold the proof you seek. I have seen it in my dreams. I visited there three times, each time just a fleeting moment before I was snatched away by the rising sun…but try as I might, I cannot find the way again. I have spent many nights searching.”\n“Oh?” Virgil asks, intrigued. “And what is this place?”\n“It is a marvelous city,” he describes, his eyes aglow with wonder, “golden and lovely like nothing I have seen before or since. A city beyond the peaks of the unknown mountain Kadath, where no one has ever set foot before. There, veiled within the clouds and crowned by stars, lies the onyx castle of the Great Ones.”\nVirgil idly pets the cat on the countertop next to him as he is absorbed by Randolph’s tale. It is a slender creature with lustrous black fur, dark as the void of space itself. “Then we must find this place! Even if it does not have the proof we seek, it sounds like the adventure of a lifetime. Enough to fill a hundred pages, or more!”\nYou tell Virgil and Randolph that before you commit to such an adventure, you must return to the waking world and tell your companions about your experiences. Just then, another voice, cryptic and quiet, chimes: “Oh, you can’t wake up. The eye is upon you now.”\nYou and the others spin your heads around, searching for the source of the voice. The barkeeper? Another patron? Then Virgil’s black cat stretches and sits up, its piercing yellow eyes reflecting the light of the sun through the window outside. “I have waited a long time for you to seek Kadath,” it says.\n“You can talk?” Virgil says, nearly toppling over his stool as he jumps in surprise.\n“I’m a cat, you dolt. Of course I can talk,” the black cat replies, licking its paw out of boredom. “You have met a thousand cats from Ulthar, and now you are surprised?”\n“But…I thought…” Virgil wipes his brow with his palm.\n“Never mind him,” the black cat says, addressing you directly. “I assure you, you cannot cross back into the waking world until you find Kadath. It is your only way out. In the meantime, I will return and tell your companions about the quest ahead of you.” It hops off of the countertop and walks confidently toward the exit. “Though I imagine their task will be even more arduous…”"
