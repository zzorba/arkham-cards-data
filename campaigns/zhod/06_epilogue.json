You have one last thing to do before you put this whole thing behind you.\nA few days earlier, your contacts at the federal government gave you the young woman's address. You go straight to her house. Luck must be with you, as the Company director's daughter opens the door of the house, where she lives alone.\nMiss Promise is as beautiful in person as she is in the picture, although she wears black for mourning and looks like she hasn't eaten much lately. Once you have introduced yourself, you begin to tell her your story, as well as Kurtz's. The young woman listens to you fervently, not missing a single bit of your story - although you leave out the unspeakable moments of your encounters with the Darkness.\nWhen you reach the moment of Kurtz's death, you pause for a moment, not knowing how to describe his last moments without making your listener even more miserable.\n\"I understand your reservations\" guesses Miss Promise, \"but please, at least tell me his last words. I beg you...\"\nYou pull yourself together and slowly tell her, \"The last thing he said was... your name.\"\n\"I knew it,\" she replied, \"I knew it!\" Miss Promise buries her face in her hands, tears flowing.\nWhy did you lie to Miss Promise? This question will often torment you. It is only later that the truth will take shape in your mind. To confess Kurtz's last words to his beloved, would have allowed the Darkness to live on, somehow, in a mind other than your own."

The adventure of designing Heart of Darkness is strangely similar to the journey up the Congo River -- an endless journey.\nMy ambition was to adapt the story but also the atmosphere of Joseph Conrad's book. The kind of heavy, unreal, and introspective atmosphere that you feel when following the adventure of Captain Marlow. I thought to myself, \"If someone had told me that Lovecraft wrote this story, I wouldn't have been surprised. What is told becomes as terrifying as any story in the Cthulhu Mythos.\"\nIt is customary to end these design notes with a little teaser about what is planned for the future. I'm sorry to say that for my part, although I have no shortage of ideas for scenarios, I simply don't have the time to produce new custom scenarios. I'll leave you in good company though, as the community around this game has never been as prolific as in the last few years, producing incredible scenarios with regularity. I will of course stay with you, and who knows, maybe we'll meet again... if the stars are right.\nBe well, long live you, our favorite game and the custom scenarios!"
