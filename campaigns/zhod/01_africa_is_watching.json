You are impressed by the bustling life of the people there, the to-and-fro of the merchant ships and the fragile crafts maneuvered by the indigenous people. In the distance, you can see a large Western warship shelling the bush, for no apparent reason or consequence, and apparently without causing any alarm.\nOnce you arrive in Boma, the capital of the Belgian Congo situated at the mouth of the river, you embark on a shuttle that travels between Boma and the Company's Central Station, located a little further upriver. The coolness you felt from the ocean air throughout the journey begins to give way to a humid heat, which gradually becomes more suffocating.\nBefore arriving at the Company's Central Station, you review once again the papers that Mr. Promise provided regarding Kurtz. One photograph in particular draws your attention. It shows a young, vibrant and happy-looking Kurtz, looking sharp in his bush outfit, with a shotgun in one hand and helmet in the other."

As agreed with Mr. Promise, you report to the Director of the Central Station.\nYou find him standing in front of his office door, waiting for you. The Belgian expat is unremarkable in all ways: age, complexion, traits, manners, height, white-skinned and dark-haired. Only his blue eyes, particularly cold, seemed out of the ordinary.\n\"Hello.\" he says, somewhat curtly. \"You must be the one Mr. Promise told me about? Great, but unfortunately we won't be going anywhere just now. The only boat we had that could navigate the sandbanks upriver ran aground not far from here. That's what happens when the crew doesn't have a captain skilled enough to safely maneuver on the river. We did have one, to start with, but the last attempt to bring Kurtz back to the Company was... how shall I put it? Disastrous, yes. They were just mercenaries, but still... Well, I know that Mr. Promise expects you to find a peaceful solution to this problem, but I intend to take a few precautions for our trip upriver, just in case. I will accompany you on your mission, as well as a team I have personally selected to resolve this problem... once and for all. If there is no other solution, of course. Bringing that devil Kurtz back is your priority, but I'll be honest - I have other, more urgent matters to attend to at the moment, and most of my workforce is occupied elsewhere. I therefore leave you in charge of repairing the ship.\"\nThe director walks away, then turns back and calls out: \n\"Oh, and by the way, welcome to the Congo!\""
