Who else but the escaped prisoner could have done such a thing? You saw all the other crew members on deck just moments ago. A quick inspection of your belongings tells you that nothing has been taken from you, except for Kurtz's belongings which you found in his hiding place at the Central Station.\nYou think for a moment. The prisoner took a lot of risks during his escape. Not only did he not leave the ship immediately, but he also created a diversion in order to come and get a few letters and photos belonging to Kurtz.\nYou think back to the nighttime assault that happened a while ago. You had thought that the objective was to kill you, or at least to slow down your progress towards Kurtz. But in reality, there were not that many of them, and your losses were limited. What if their goal all along was to recover Kurtz's belongings? You try to remember what was in the documents, if there was anything worth taking such risks to retrieve, but to no avail. No matter, you are convinced, and you are now a little closer to understanding Kurtz's true intentions when you face him."
