Will whatever has been hidden in our hearts since the dawn of time spark the beginning of our own destruction? \nTravel deep into the heart of the Congo and navigate its perilous waters aboard the Roi des Belges to discover the <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, an unofficial campaign for Arkham Horror: The Card Game.\nThe 3 scenarios of this campaign are an adaptation of the eponymous book by Joseph Conrad set within the Cthulhu Mythos.
