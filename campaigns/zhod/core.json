You feel that he regularly tries to push it away, with increasing difficulty. You take advantage of one of these brief moments of lucidity to convince him to follow you aboard the Roi des Belges, so that he can see for himself that you are able to ensure his safe return.\nKurtz follows you, moving painfully and seemingly in danger of collapsing from exhaustion every couple of steps, so you are completely taken by surprise when, halfway to the boat, he suddenly straightens and runs off into the jungle as if he were in the best of health."

You understand that the cage is made of ivory, and that the black pharaoh is an incarnation of the Darkness you are fighting against.\nParadoxically, the fossilized ivory, which seems to be the source of the Darkness' power, is also the main element of the ritual to trap it.
