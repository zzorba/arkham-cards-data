The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.\nSo far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”\n\n–Minnie Klein"

You ascend the staircase once more and position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun.

If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help…only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up.

It grips until your breath is trapped and your windpipe starts to crack. Only there is nothing there—just a chilly draft entering the room through the open window. The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\nThe cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\nNO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n“Real or imagined, your fate approaches all the same.”"

Before any threats can be fulfilled, the silence is broken by an icy voice. “Now gentlemen, there is no need for that.” The men withdraw to reveal an elderly man you recognize as Carl Sanford, the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. Despite the dangerous situation, his expression is almost too casual. The complete lack of fear in his posture and his actions suggests a confidence backed by substantial power.
