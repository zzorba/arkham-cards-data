The charges brought against Sanford are flimsy at best. No judge or jury is going to believe any story about dark rituals and eldritch beings. Even if you could convince others of Sanford’s dangerous ideologies, his considerable influence and political clout ensures he’ll be released sooner than you would like. Even so, you had to separate him from his lackeys while you cleaned up his mess. You tell Sanford that you’ll be keeping an eye on him once he is out.\n“And I, you,” he retorts."

She beckons you forward. “Our coven is bound by much more than simple association. We are a family. And we are proud to welcome you into our midst.”\nWith your new understanding of the universe and the forces that hold it together, you promise to use your knowledge only to maintain the balance of the world. Erynn and the others nod in agreement.\n“This city is already stained with much blood,” she says. “Spilling more is not an act of cleansing. Let us be shields, and blades of vengeance no longer.”"

Smeared along the walls of the cell is a sticky red substance, painted in a delicate pattern. The woman is nowhere to be seen."

You inform him that there is to be a meeting in the sanctum this very night. “Very well. I will summon our most loyal members.” You dismiss him and turn to look out the window of your new office. The city of Arkham is as grim and moody as ever…but at least now you can protect it from the forces that lay beyond the Earth."

As always, her prescience is disconcerting, but by now you have gotten used to it. “I’ve been expecting you for some time,” she admits. “I suppose you have questions for me. Very well. Ask away. Though I imagine that by now you must know the answer.” She neither offers you a seat nor a drink. You begin to describe your situation, though the truth of your condition is plain to see for somebody with her gifts (and few else). You had hoped for another explanation— any explanation at all—but it was only a desperate clinging to hope, without justification. Anna gives you a pitying grimace and shakes her head. “Surely by now you must understand. You have completed your task. Your business here has concluded. Now is the time for you to rest and be at peace.”\nPeace? No, you cannot be at peace! There is still so much left for you to do…!"

It controls your every thought—your hopes, your bonds, your fears, your ambitions. A reminder of your futile existence. Each night, you toss and turn, unable to wrench free from this sensation of worthlessness. Your thoughts turn to a grim, uncertain future. A future without life. A future without <i>you</i>. It is the one ordeal every mortal must endure, and yet the one experience no mortal could possibly describe. Ghosts? Realms beyond our mortal coil? Nothing but a last resort for a mind desperate to cling to life.\nWhen the creature next invades, you have come to a new conclusion. An icy draft surrounds you as the thing coalesces before you. Your throat constricts and tears well in your eyes, but you stand tall. You are unafraid. The creature gazes at you curiously, and the piping of infernal flutes fades into silence. It extends its clawed hand, and you shake it. You will never truly be free from its grasp, but perhaps you and the creature can work in agreement. Perhaps you can tame your fear. It doesn’t matter if the world has no point. It’s yours, damnit, and nothing will stop you from altering it to your liking."
