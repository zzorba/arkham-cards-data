You dare not turn and look behind you, for you know that what you see will likely break your heart, or perhaps your mind. Great polypous horrors slide darkly amidst the blackness and loneliness of the cosmos. You had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it not ringing in your head this very moment.\nThere is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where you must go… The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."

Shuffle the rest back into the Cosmos.”\nThe revealed side of each Cosmos location has a “<b>Cosmos</b> –” instruction which tells the investigator where to connect that location. (For example, “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect above” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately above the investigator’s location, whereas “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect to the right” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately to the right of the investigator’s location.)\nA new location cannot enter play in a position already occupied by a location. If a location’s connection instructions are impossible to fulfill, shuffle that location back into the Cosmos and cancel the effects of the move.\n“<b>Cosmos</b> –” instructions are only resolved when a location is being drawn from the Cosmos.
