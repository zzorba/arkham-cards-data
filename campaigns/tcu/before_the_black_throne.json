You dare not turn and look behind you, for you know that what you see will likely break your heart, or perhaps your mind. Great polypous horrors slide darkly amidst the blackness and loneliness of the cosmos. You had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it not ringing in your head this very moment.\nThere is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where you must go… The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."

Shuffle the rest back into the Cosmos.”\nThe revealed side of each Cosmos location has a “<b>Cosmos</b> –” instruction which tells the investigator where to connect that location. (For example, “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect above” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately above the investigator’s location, whereas “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect to the right” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately to the right of the investigator’s location.)\nA new location cannot enter play in a position already occupied by a location. If a location’s connection instructions are impossible to fulfill, shuffle that location back into the Cosmos and cancel the effects of the move.\n“<b>Cosmos</b> –” instructions are only resolved when a location is being drawn from the Cosmos.

It is a lullaby of sorts, meant to keep the oblivious god from waking. For just a brief moment, the pipers’ song was interrupted, and Azathoth began to stir. Now you understand why Anna came to you that fateful night and begged to read your fortune. She knew the part you would have to play when you arrived here.\nSitting down at the edge of the creature’s nighted throne, you take out your flute, and begin to play.\nIn this place where time and hunger and age and weariness are mortal aspects of no concern to you, it is your duty to continue to play. Without fail. Without end.",

You gather together what you need for your ritual—a bit of shadowy essence from the witches’ cloaks, a fragment of spectral mist from the wraiths you banished, and the knowledge you’ve gained from delving into Arkham’s past. Slowly, quietly, you weave your wall together, stitching darkness with blood, blood with souls, souls with onyx stone. It takes ages to complete. When you are done, your reward is oblivion. A stillness and silence so pure, so perfect, no disturbance can penetrate it. The barrier cannot hold Azathoth—nothing truly can—but perhaps now it will not stir when fools on Earth call forth its name or draw from its power. With your task complete, you turn and face the darkness, summoning your steed. It is time to go home.",

You cannot kill it, and even attempting to harm it would only risk stirring it. Desperate, you turn to Keziah’s Black Book for answers. A quill appears in your hands as you open the tome, and a voice from beyond reaches your ears. “Sign it with your blood. Take a new secret name, and your desire shall become truth. You and your world will be spared.” You know it is the voice of evil, the voice Walter Gilman heard which surely led to his demise, the voice which seduced Keziah Mason and led to this path in the first place…but what other choice to you have?",
