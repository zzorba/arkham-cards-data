      "text": "It is a breezy November evening in Arkham—the perfect night for a walk through Independence Square, or so you had thought, up until the moment Anna Kaslow offered to tell your fortune. You agreed, though you would soon come to regret this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck, she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune. Judgment. Temperance. Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

More of the hooded figures emerge from the tree line, eager to defend their leader. “Interloper!” one calls you, pulling off her hood and pointing a gnarled wooden rod in your direction. Her bright-red hair glows in the firelight, embers dancing about her extended hand. “They’re the ones from before, High Priestess: the ones who interfered with our great work.”\nThe “High Priestess” holds up a single hand, and a hush falls over the other witches. “As always, I admire your perseverance, sister. But I do not believe these are the ones you speak of,” she replies to the red-haired accuser. You lower your weapons as several of the hooded figures approach and surround their leader. They begin chanting in a soft tone as they examine her wounds. The red-haired witch crosses her arms and watches you with a hard glare, her gaze never straying far from you. “I am Anette,” says the leader of the coven, “and these are my sisters. Tell me: Who are you, and why are you here?”\nYou explain how you awoke in the woods, how you were attacked by terrible creatures, and how you came to the center of this circle in order to break the spell surrounding the woods. Anette’s eyes narrow as she hears your story. “That is impossible. The circle was closed. None could enter the woods while we were completing our spell.” She grits her teeth. “You must go at once. This is not your place.”\n“But, High Priestess!—” the red-haired witch exclaims, only to be interrupted by Anette’s gaze. The two lock eyes, a battle of wills that quickly proves Anette victorious.\n“Stand down, Erynn,” Anette says with a firm, motherly tone, as though admonishing a child. She turns her attention back to you as the witch named Erynn lowers her head in defeat. “Go. You’ve broken the spell, just as you desired. You can leave the woods now. But I give you one final warning: cross us again, and we will not be so merciful.”\nYou begin to protest, but before you are able to utter a single word, a dark gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing. Shadows from beyond the tree line suddenly twist and coil into the clearing, tugging at the edges of the witches’ cloaks. One by one, the shadows twist and pull each of the witches into the darkness beyond. In moments, they are gone. You are left with only the soft glow of moonlight to guide you home.",

      "text": "With the spell broken, the hooded figures turn their attention to you. More of them emerge from the tree line, eager to take vengeance upon you for destroying their plans. “Interloper!” one of them calls you, pulling off her hood and pointing a gnarled wooden rod in your direction. Her bright-red hair glows in the firelight, embers dancing about her extended hand. “You will not escape this time!” she cries, prepared to strike you down.\n“Stop!” the leader of the coven yells in a commanding voice, holding up her hand. The red-haired accuser stops in her tracks, and there is a sudden stillness in the clearing around the circle.\n“But High Priestess,” the witch persists, “they’re the ones from before. The ones who interfered with our great work.”\nThe High Priestess places a hand on the red-haired witch’s shoulder. “As always, I admire your perseverance, sister. But I do not believe these are the ones you speak of,” she replies.\nThe red-haired witch lowers her rod as the High Priestess approaches you, her arms crossed. She watches you with a hard glare, her gaze never straying far from you. “I am Anette, and these are my sisters,” she says. “Tell me: who are you, and why are you here?”\nYou explain how you awoke in the woods, how you were attacked by terrible creatures, and how you came to the center of this circle in order to break the spell surrounding the woods. Anette’s eyes narrow as she hears your story. “That is impossible. The circle was closed. None could enter the woods while we were completing our spell.” She grits her teeth. “You must go at once. This is not your place.”\n“But, High Priestess!—” the red-haired witch exclaims, only to be interrupted by Anette’s gaze. The two lock eyes, a battle of wills that quickly proves Anette victorious.\n“Stand down, Erynn,” Anette says with a firm, motherly tone, as though admonishing a child. She turns her attention back to you as the witch named Erynn lowers her head in defeat. “Go. You’ve broken the spell, just as you desired. You can leave the woods now. But I give you one final warning: cross us again, and we will not be so merciful.”\nYou begin to protest, but before you are able to utter a single word, a dark gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing. Shadows from beyond the tree line suddenly twist and coil into the clearing, tugging at the edges of the witches’ cloaks. One by one, the shadows twist and pull each of the witches into the darkness beyond. In moments, they are gone. You are left with only the soft glow of moonlight to guide you home.",

Your entire body rattles with the sensation. Blood trickles from your ears, and tears well in your eyes. You try to crawl to safety, but it is to no avail. The piping only grows in volume, the discordant cacophony shattering your eardrums and turning your thoughts to sludge. Eventually, after what feels like hours, weariness claims your consciousness.\nWhen you next awaken, it is by the side of Hangman’s Brook, where a small child is shaking you vigorously by the shoulders. “Get back here; don’t touch them!” the child’s mother calls to the boy, and he recoils from you. Considering the state you’re in, you wouldn’t be surprised if she thought you some kind of rummy. You brush some of the caked dirt off of your coat and rise begrudgingly to your feet, wandering toward Uptown.",
