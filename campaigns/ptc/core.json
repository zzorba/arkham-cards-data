This should be done without revealing that card or its text to the other investigators. While a hidden card is in your hand, treat it as if it were in your threat area. Its Constant abilities are active, and abilities on it can be triggered, but only by you. A hidden card counts toward your hand size, but it cannot be discarded from your hand by any means except those described on the card. When discarded, hidden cards are placed in the encounter discard pile. They do not remain a part of your deck like weaknesses do. For the best experience, players are encouraged to stay “in character” and not share information about hidden cards in their hand."

This is done by filling in one of the boxes next to “<b>Doubt</b>” or “<b>Conviction</b>” in the Campaign Log.\nLater in the campaign, some scenarios may be changed or altered depending on whether the investigators “have more <b>Doubt</b> than <b>Conviction</b>” or “have more <b>Conviction</b> than <b>Doubt</b>.” The investigators have more <b>Doubt</b> than <b>Conviction</b> if the number of boxes filled in next to <b>Doubt</b> is greater than the number of boxes filled in next to <b>Conviction</b> (and vice versa). <b>Doubt</b> and <b>Conviction</b> are shared among all of the investigators, and they are not tied to any specific investigator. <b>Doubt</b> and <b>Conviction</b> have no game effect except when explicitly referenced by the Campaign Guide or by a card effect."
