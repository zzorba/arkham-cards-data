What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail… And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\nYou’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

The beating of sinewy wings and screeching of creatures above you spurs you onward. Soon you find yourself running down a narrow avenue, passing a set of heavy iron gates. You are in a dead end—a court with tall, old houses on either side. You turn back toward the entrance to find the shapes of many winged creatures barring your path. They are perched on the gates and on the balconies above, awaiting your doom. Walking with cold, sinister confidence, the man in black opens the iron gate and enters the court. His face gleams in the darkness. His eyes pierce your soul. For a moment, you recognize him for what he truly is. It is the last you remember of that night.",

You push these gloomy thoughts to the back of your mind and knock on Mr. Engram’s door. A flock of magpies scatters from the rooftop at the sudden noise. Then, to your surprise, the door opens.\nAcross the threshold of the doorway stands a tall man with a thick, brown mustache. A familiar silver-handled cane leans against the wall next to his coat hanger. “So it’s you,” he says. “Come in. I have expected you for some time now.” He turns away and walks toward his kitchen. You can hear a teapot whistling, as though he’d been preparing for your arrival.\nYou enter his home, unsure of what to do next. This gentle, unassuming man is not quite what you had expected. Nigel’s home is a mess of notes, old books, and strange diagrams. Covering the coffee table in his living room is an old, faded map, bearing many fold creases and tattered edges. It looks to be an incomplete map of the catacombs beneath Paris, or at least a section of it. Mr. Engram returns moments later with hot tea and a plate of cheese and crackers. “I assume you are here to find the path to Carcosa?” he asks, wearing an excited grin. You shake your head in response, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He paces back and forth around the room as he speaks rapidly. “He told me that you would be arriving soon. That I should… Prepare.” Nigel turns toward you as he reaches the wooden door across from you, his eyes flashing. “Don’t worry. All is ready. The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret his cryptic comments. You wait a few minutes for him to return, but when he does not, you begin to worry. Then you notice that mold has already begun to grow over the cheese he’d brought you. “Mr. Engram?” you call out, and you hesitantly knock on the door to his study. There is no response. When you enter the room, you find him hanging from the ceiling fan, his body rotting from weeks of decomposition.",
