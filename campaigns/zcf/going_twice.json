Any loot of high enough value will be stored somewhere secure but accessible, alongside other valuable items that the thieves intend to fence.  Moreover, the amount and variety of the stolen artifacts would make finding a single buyer nigh impossible.  The most likely conclusion is that the O'Bannions will sell the artifacts piecemeal to collectors who know not to ask questions.  The one situation where these threads come together is a black market auction run by the gangsters.  You make the usual trade of dollars for rumors to learn about where such an auction is being held, and head back to your home to prepare.\nHaving spent the early evening on the waterfront, you arrive fashionably late to the event.  A few other finely-dressed latecomers file alongside you toward the O'Bannions' cover business, a private art gallery.  Two hulking mobsters stand at the entrance, sizing you up as you approach.  The thought occurs that they likely won't let you inside with any weapons.  The question now is how to proceed."

The woman scrutinizes your face once more as she exhales before replying.  \"What I'm about to tell you does not leave this room.  Am I understood?\"  You nod curtly, though Ms. Shanley takes her time before responding again.  \"Wycliffe is the man who hired us to take the artifacts in the first place.  Here.\"  The broker opens her desk and pulls out a check for a sizeable sum, with Wycliffe's signature clearly printed at the bottom, a perfect match for the one on your letter.  Ms. Shanley allows you to view the check for a few seconds before she returns it to her desk and stands stiffly.  \"If you want any further information, I suggest you ask Wycliffe directly.
