      "text": "Though the rain subsided while you were at the auction, the late night air is still damp and frigid.  Your mind dwells on the many possible confrontations with Wycliffe as you march briskly toward his estate in French Hill.  It's difficult to predict conversations with a man that you know so little about.  James Wycliffe isn't even a native of Arkham, having moved here from out of state several years ago.  You believe him to be a retired architect from Pennsylvania, from what the articles about his earlier expeditions stated, but it's clear that he's something more than that.  The one thing that is certain is that he knows the truth about these strange events tonight.\nWycliffe's manor slowly comes into view as you round the corner to his street.  Its design straddles the line between compliance with the French Hill aesthetic and the flair of modern art deco architecture, designed by Wycliffe himself.  Your appreciation is understandably minimal as you tread the garden path up to the front door.  You seize the brass knocker, intending to wake the whole household if need be, but the door swings open limply at first touch.\nThe questions that had been percolating in your mind all night evaporate in a flash.  There, just beyond the mantle in the dim light of the street lamp behind you, lies the body of James Wycliffe.  His face is frozen in a mask of terror, and it is clear from the bloodied holes in his evening jacket that his death was anything but natural.  You stand in stunned silence until a creak from the upper floor echoes down at you.  Whoever murdered Wycliffe is still here.  But why?  Your mind races through the facts until you arrive at a single new objective.  Wycliffe may be dead, but the answers to your questions must still be somewhere within his mansion.  Whether the murderers want to learn the truth for themselves or simply destroy it, you had certainly better find it before they do.\nThe murderers seem to know plenty about Wycliffe, but you still need to make up lost ground.  You begin at once with the corpse.  At first the body seems bare of anything but clothes, until a glint from the street lamp reflects off of Wycliffe's fingers.  A silver ring etched with strange symbols shines up at you.  Anything unusual could be instrumental in unraveling this mystery, and so you pocket the ring before beginning your search of the manor in full."

Wycliffe has meticulously examined the articles, highlighting several passages and events that bear some resemblance to the trials you've faced tonight, particularly those concerning ancient ruins, vile fish creatures, and a malevolent deity whose followers call it <b>Cthulhu</b>.

He never intended for you to find the Mycenaean artifacts at all, but to be an excuse to keep these men off the trail.  Unfortunately for him, they found the stone and murdered him for his interference.

Through your diligence and determination, you now know the full series of events that led up to the architect's murder.  Wycliffe's funding of the expeditions was done at least in part for the benefit of his former associates.  This continued until the most recent one, during which he discovered some secret and resolved to keep the artifacts out of their hands.  He hired the O'Bannions to hijack the shipment, and then subsequently hired you to both make himself appear innocent and to discourage his former colleagues from attempting to find the stone themselves.  You don't know what he intended to do with the stone after that, but he may have been banking on the O'Bannions' violent reputation to keep it safe.\nDespite Wycliffe's efforts, he wasn't able to outwit your enemies for very long.  It concerns you how quickly this organization was able to act, and how many agents they fielded against you.  They seem to be everywhere, always plotting and moving.  Your thoughts flash back to the cult reports in the drafting room, and you recall the similar way that the servants of <b>Cthulhu</b> operated, always in the shadows and always ready to strike.  The gruesome fishlike creatures you battled at the riverfront lend credence to this theory.\nCult or not, the question you must now ask is where these men have taken the Mycenaean stone and just what they intend to do with it.  From what you can surmise based on Wycliffe's experiments with the stone in his study and his own architecture, the spatial warping property is central to their plan, and he likely taught them to reproduce this effect before his discovery of their secrets.  You also can guess based on Wycliffe's geographical research that their plot will culminate somewhere far from Arkham, but he hadn't figured that point out before his death.  Your only lead now is to trace where Wycliffe met with his former comrades and interrogate them yourself.",
