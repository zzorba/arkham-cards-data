Queen Ozma has commanded us to bring the intruders to her without any delay!\"  The soldier nods and motions for you to stand, though you hardly need encouragement.  A civilization this rich might be able to lend some assistance in containing the Colour, provided they aren't as fickle as the plant people you first encountered.\nThe portly man -- the guardian of the gates, as he calls himself -- leads you through the pristine streets of the emerald city.  Its citizens, all as richly dressed as nobility, observe you with some curiosity, but seem largely unconcerned.  The procession wends its way to an opulent palace in the center of the city.  The gateman and soldier take a brief moment to adjust their disheveled appearances before leading you proudly inside.\n\"Your majesty, the intruders!\"  The two shepherd you forward into a grand audience chamber.  A young girl in regal attire sits at the center in an emerald throne, looking serenely out at you.  Beside and around her stand eclectic figures that surprise you to say the least.  A scarecrow, a man made of tin, another man made of brass, a gangly figure with a pumpkin for a head, each one looking at you as though you were the odd ones out instead.\n\"Approach, strangers,\" Queen Ozma commands in a pleasant tone.  A small bald man next to her gives an amused chuckle at the sight of you.  \"Well well, more people from outside Oz?  I didn't think it possible with the anti-aircraft spell I put up over the country.\" Another woman -- tall and graceful with long red hair -- nods in agreement.  \"More than that, Oz should be entirely separated from their world.  Could this be related to the strange meteor?\"\nYou step forward as ordered, telling the queen and her court that you know all about the meteor, and that you intend to stop its evils.  The throne room falls silent as you relate the first visit of the Colour to the Gardner farm outside Arkham.  Their faces fall, and some utter words of horror as you describe the gruesome events.  Queen Ozma bites her thumb as worry washes over her.  \"The citizens of Oz cannot be killed, but this transformation is something far worse than death.  I cannot stand by while this... Colour threatens the safety of Oz.\"  Her court murmurs in agreement as she stands to address them.  \"As they know the capabilities of the living Colour, these visitors will lead us in expelling it from Oz.\"\n\"And the rest of the world too!\" the bald man chimes in.\nAs the court mobilizes, a young girl in a simple gingham dress enters, accompanied by two other girls and a little black dog.  \"Oh, hello!\" she calls out, approaching you with great interest.  \"I didn't know folks from outside Oz could still get in.  My name's Dorothy, and I came here from Kansas.  Where're you folks from?\""

A wooden sawhorse, with a crudely carved horse's head, comes hobbling out of the stables.  His wooden feet are shod with gold and he wears a saddle stamped with the royal crest of Oz.  \"Hello, friend Dorothy,\" he says in a scratchy voice, \"do you need to travel somewhere?\"  Dorothy scratches his wooden muzzle as she leads him over to you.  \"We do, Sawhorse.  There's some big trouble that our new friends here told us about, and you can help us travel better than anyone.\"  The Sawhorse looks to you with his wooden knot eyes with some indifference.  \"Hello.  If Dorothy says you are friends, then you are friends.\"  The young girl leads the Sawhorse back around toward the front of the palace.  \"He may be knobby, but there's no faster thing in Oz.  He was brought to life by the same powder that Ozma used on Jack, only instead of brains, the Sawhorse got speed.\"  You hope that such a bumpy-looking ride won't be necessary, but there's no telling what dangers the Colour may present."

She's the Good Witch of the South.\"\nGlinda smiles to Dorothy at the introduction, but her face grows serious as the topic shifts.  \"You may have seen as you entered that Oz is divided into four countries.  Each one lies in one of the four cardinal directions from the Emerald City.  I know which country the meteor has landed in, but I do not know where precisely.  It will be up to you to find it and determine our course of action.\""
