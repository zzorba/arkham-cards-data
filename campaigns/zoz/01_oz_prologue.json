Few but old Ammi Pierce still talked about the strange days when the Gardner farm was transformed into the blasted heath, but the scientific record remained in the archives of Miskatonic University.  That record spoke of the same alien colour that appeared in the spectroscope the astronomers took of a second meteor approaching Earth rapidly last week.  Claims and theories flew, but the scientists agreed that this time, the meteorite must be recovered in full for both study and to protect the world from its possible destruction.  Funding for an expedition was amassed in short order, including stipulations for a team of specialists with experience in the weird mysteries of the universe.</fancy>",

Over the course of a week, the chartered ship navigated around the continent to make port in San Francisco.  Initial estimations of the meteor's trajectory placed its landing site in the Pacific Ocean.  The scientists earnestly hoped that it would impact on an island or at the very least somewhere shallow enough for their equipment to reach it, but the Pacific is nothing if not vast.  All they could do is sail to the general region and keep their fingers crossed.  With your knowledge of the Colour, you didn't know which outcome to hope for, only to keep ready.\nIt was just after dawn, three days into Pacific waters when the meteor finally entered Earth's atmosphere.  The expedition stood on deck with eyes skyward for the spectacle Ammi Pierce described, only this time much larger.  An explosion rocked the cloud layer as friction slowed the meteor's descent, and a long plume of white smoke flared out behind it.  Your eyes followed the trail of smoke down until it vanished just beyond the horizon north of the ship.  The captain gave a call to stations to brace for the expected wave of water from the impact.  Tense minutes passed but the sea remained placid.  Confused, the officers confirmed their position and checked charts.  By all accounts there should be only open water for hundreds of miles in any direction, but the evidence was clear.  Somehow, the meteor made landfall."
