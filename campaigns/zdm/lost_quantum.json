      "text": "\"When the world ended, the various scientific and mining communities of different nationalities that lie in the asteroid belt between the planets Mars and Jupiter had formed a pact — a promise to ensure the survival of mankind. […] The United Colonial Coalition is composed of twenty colonies, varying widely in size, population, and purpose. Some colonies exist solely for mining, while others focus on scientific research or are engineering centers; these usually have fewer than 200 individuals living within them. Other asteroids serve as population centers, containing vast hydroponic farms, universities, and recreational areas. These can be home to more than a thousand colonists…\"\n<right>- Maja, Information Archives</right>\nWhen you arrive at the asteroid, you are absorbed by the fuchsia glow of Elbrus. Quantum materials have only recently been discovered, but may hold key properties that could be used to engineer devices that would have been impossible with classical materials. Unfortunately, quantum fields generated by these materials disrupt traditional radio communication, making it impossible for you to hail the scientists on Elbrus. Without further ado, you and your companions board one of the landing crafts and drift towards the asteroid…\nThe purple aurora spreads over the viewport like distant milk, filling the room with an electric tinge. Your final approach vector takes you directly over one of the larger craters on the asteroid. The computer calculates the trajectories, and commences the final descent onto the rocky surface. It is just then that the short-range radios crackle into a man's terrified voice. \"Abort the landing procedure now! Abort! Before —\" But it is too late. The warning lights begin flashing on and off as the craft spins out of control. You grab onto anything you can, but the vessel increasingly spins and spins until your arms flail and darkness prevails…"

The cultists have stolen the quantum shards from Elbrus, but for what purpose, you are still unsure.\nYou look into the ephemeral glow of the crystal shard Erwin has gifted you, wondering about the bizarre circumstances you have found yourself in. However, there's no time to waste on self-reflection — K2-PS187 awaits your next heading.",

The physicist sighs in relief. \"Thank god you came in time. It's a shame about all that research that was lost, but at least everyone is safe. Now please explain to me why we are now in the very ship I remember came to pillage our facility.\" You brief Erwin on your quest and discuss what purposes the cultists could have had with the quantum shards. The physicist proposes several ideas of quantum weaponry or tools - but none of which makes any sense. Regardless, he is willing to join you on your quest — out of good will or curiosity, you are unsure. Still unsure of why the cultists have come, you prepare for the next destination, which may finally give a few answers rather than pose more questions.",
