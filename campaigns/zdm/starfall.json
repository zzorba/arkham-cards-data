Whatever the cultists have done within Fragment has doomed our solar system to a premature end.\nYour only hope now is to convince the remainder of the various colonies of humanity of this accelerated death and help them gather the resources and technology necessary to survive the supernova in any way possible. K2-PS187 makes the preparations for the navigation console as you brace for the many-months long journey ahead of you travelling across the solar system to save humanity.",
