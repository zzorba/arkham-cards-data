K2-PS187 estimates that there are only a few years left before the fusion reactions that fuel our star will run out of gas and collapse on itself, generating a radioactive supernova that will destroy all life within a few light years. Whatever the cultists have done within Fragment has doomed our solar system to a premature end.\nYour only hope now is to convince the remainder of the various colonies of humanity of this accelerated death and help them gather the resources and technology necessary to survive the supernova in any way possible. K2-PS187 makes the preparations for the navigation console as you brace for the many-months long journey ahead of you travelling across the solar system to save humanity."

In your final moments, despite being unable to save yourself from the blast, you feel accomplished -- and redeemed -- by what you have done to save the others.",
