The cultists recently undertook a mission to free Tassilda, daughter of Hastur, rumored to be imprisoned on an asteroid codenamed Fragment. The ship managed to rendezvous with Fragment and deployed several survey teams to search the caverns upon it. Before your current mind was implanted, you were one of these cultist explorers, destined to awaken Tassilda.\nAfter a few weeks of survey, one of the teams retrieved a slab of alien hieroglyphs, and ordered K2-PS187 to begin a translation. Another team reported to have found the inner chambers where Tassilda resided and destroyed the imprisoning sigils. They were never heard from again.\nYou and your fellow cultists swiftly withdrew from the asteroid before the princess of Carcosa could awaken and attack the Tatterdemalion. Content that such were the risks one took worshipping gods of pure chaos, you did not mourn your lost companions. The ship was set to return to the inner solar system. Your mission has been a success. You had finally freed Tassilda, the daughter of Hastur, who might soon be elevated by her father to become a new Ancient One.\nWhile most of the cultists entered cryosleep for the journey home, K2-PS187 was busy analysing the alien runes. When the translation was complete, the computer learned of a story titled \"Heir to Carcosa.\" The knowledge caused it to go insane and slaughter all of the waking crew out of terror. The ship was left in turmoil, drifting without sense through space — until K2-PS187 brought you back into this world from the archives in a final cry for help.\nYou now understand what you must do. Although Earth is no longer the home it used to be, humanity still exists, spread out throughout colonies in the solar system, living in fear and in isolation. If the being named Tassilda, Heir to Carcosa, would be exalted by her father, there is no doubt that she will decide to reign over humanity's colonies with the madness of Carcosa. You must atone for your past sins and eliminate the entity before she can be elevated to godhood. Unfortunately, the last recorded positions of Fragment were among the data lost during the initial corruption. However, K2-PS187 was able to retrieve a few leads from the ship's itinerary. You will need to traverse the solar system to locate the coordinates of the asteroid and prevent Tassilda's ascension.",

For the next three hours, you witness a horrifying creative work, full of betrayal, intrigue, and horror. The story unfolds thus:</center>\n<center>After claiming Yhtill and absorbing it into Carcosa, the King in Yellow took the insane princess Camilla as a consort. Before her death, the princess bore the Ancient One three children, who became fosterlings of Hastur. They were two boys, named Thothut and Tasylock, and a girl named Tassilda. While normal-seeming at first, the children developed many of the physical characteristics and powers of their father. This transformation was viewed by their mother as yet another of Carcosa’s many corruptions. It was the final blow to Camilla’s mind, causing her heart to stop from despair and grief.</center>\n<center>For some time the royal trio lived with their sire in Carcosa, evil beings serving loyally at the foot of their father. But soon, like their mother, uncle, and grandmother before them, the princes and princess of Carcosa began to whisper, squabble, and plot. They had dreams of power and succession. Eventually Thothut and Tasylock unwisely moved against their father. Hastur was aware of the plot all along, and easily avoided their traps. In a way too horrible to describe, he destroyed both of his sons.</center>\n<center>His daughter Tassilda, who knew of her siblings’ plot but refused to take part in it, was spared. But she had done nothing to warn her father, choosing to wait and see if their plot was successful before committing to a course of action. For her silent betrayal, Tassilda was punished. Her father, He Who Should Not Be Named, sealed her into her home, which the Ancient One tore free of Carcosa and hurled out into space. Her father claimed that in an inevitable time, she will be released, and granted all that she desires.</center>",
