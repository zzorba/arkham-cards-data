      "text": "You struggle to follow the pace of the little girl as she skips and hops towards the small town. \"My name is Maja. My directive is to store and manage the information archives on the ship.\" She hastily explains that a few of her classmates and her were kidnapped from their school by the 'bad people' on January 16th, 2045. Their brains were surgically removed and preserved in a special experimental machine that eventually became the powerful supercomputer operating the Tatterdemalion, K2-PS187.\nAs you walk through the town, it becomes clear that something horrible has happened here. Everything appears to be in disarray, as if a riot has recently passed through. Freshly-painted yellow graffiti depicting strange symbols and hieroglyphs can be seen. Everywhere are splatters of blood, spent shell casings, and pale face masks. There are no bodies, but you can hear the sound of distant screams, gunshots, and sirens coming from beyond the streets. Nearby is an overturned police car and a black box truck lying on its side. Huge claw marks have torn into the metal of the truck and its rear doors hang open. As you walk past, a radio from within crackles and sputters, then blares, “Hello, Unit 12? Unit 12, is that you? Please respond.\" Maja clarifies that this virtual environment that represents K2-PS187's dreams takes the form of the day they got captured, the day the entire world ended. What could possibly have happened on Earth in the distant future? Or rather, the distant past?\nYou finally arrive outside of a large brick building. Maja halts and gestures towards it. \"This is where my friends are hiding. The bad people made us translate a scary story and make a movie for them. We didn't want to read it, but they made us. A few days later, Annie, the universal translator, she — she —\" Maja struggles to utter the words. There is a desperate fear in her eyes. \"You won't believe me, but I swear, it was the Boogeyman! I saw the Boogeyman eat her! I ran away and searched the archives to see if anything, anyone could help. After a long time, I finally found someone and called out to them. That's when you woke up! Now that you're inside our system, you can save us!\"\nBefore you is a path leading to a pair of double doors, above which are the words “Public School 187.” Underneath, someone has written “HASTUR RISES!” in yellow spray paint. An inhuman howl echoes through the halls inside the school, followed by children screaming in terror."

Before you can get up and exit the auditorium, the lights flicker off. A spotlight shines onto the stage, illuminating a single actor, dressed up as a clown. Something must have gone wrong inside the simulation. You are no longer inside of K2-PS187's nightmare, but your own. Without outside interference, your body will likely be drifting in endless space forever, as your mind slowly decays in this rotten reproduction of reality. The stranger begins laughing.
