The Greys, as humanity has come to know them, were under the guise of a curious species that came to our solar system to observe and probe the young civilization. The true purpose of their lunar activities have remained concealed for many years…\"\n<right>—Maja, Information Archives</right>\nYou look out the view ports and can see only dense, orange clouds for most of the descent. Only after the landing shuttle dipped into the troposphere that the clouds are thin enough for you to peer at the ground below — miles and miles of windswept dunes of methane snow, broken by knife-like volcanic ridges of icy stone, open craters belching “lava flows” of liquid water, ammonia, and methane that freeze into fantastic shapes as they pour down the slopes. You could never have dreamed of anything like the beauty and alien landscape of Titan.\nThe craft lands smoothly onto a flat slab of ice. After K2-PS187 confirms that this is the coordinates of the unusual \"business trips\" that the cultists were conducting, you suit up, open the hatch and step out into the harsh terrain. A large tunnel nestled between the orange cliffs greets you. A green glow pulsates from within, illuminating a strange figure, guarding the entrance…"
