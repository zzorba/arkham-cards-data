There is a key element missing — a connective tissue that will make sense of it all. Of course, there is also still one place you know for certain contains all of your answers, but you fear what you may find there. And that place is your own mind.\nDeep within your own subconscious, you can feel a shimmer of the cultist you embody  — imprisoned in the edges between your thoughts. You know for certain that the other version of you remembers how to find Fragment.\nEntering one's own virtual mind is particularly dangerous as any small mistake could send you spiraling into insanity. But you are ready to confront your past once and for all. With the help of K2-PS187, the cryo-chamber's dream protocols are once again tinkered with to access your own personal memories this time. You lie back down in the cryo-chamber once more. With a flick of a switch, you begin to fall back into unconsciousness…",
