According to your intel, Mr. Álvarez can often be seen spending his nights at Café Luna—a hot spot among the locals and American tourists looking to escape the iron jaws of Prohibition. Open at nearly all hours of the night and serving a variety of liquors that would make even the most seasoned bootlegger’s eyes bulge, the bar has become one of the most popular in all of Havana.\nYou arrive at peak hours, hoping to use the crowd to blend in. For all you know, Mr. Álvarez may have been warned of your approach. As soon as you arrive, you are greeted by an array of bright lights and a crowd almost too thick to squeeze past. Live jazz resounds from within the club, and many are dancing and reveling—some before they even get inside. A bouncer in a black pinstripe suit greets you at the door, giving you the once-over but not bothering to pat you down, ask for a password, or any of the usual hoops you might have to jump through back in the speakeasies hidden throughout the States.\nOnce inside, you head straight for the bartender and struggle to get his attention. You order a drink as a cover, but his expression changes the moment you say that you’re looking for a Mr. Desiderio Álvarez. Eyes narrow with suspicion, he nonetheless nods in the direction of a roped-off hallway in the back corner of the room, guarded by two more suits. Both of them flank you as you approach, and follow you into what you can only assume to be the club’s VIP section. There, in a dim, smoky back room, sits none other than the “man in the blood-soaked suit,” so named for the red accents adorning his otherwise black suit—or perhaps it is simply a metaphor. He inhales slowly from a cigarette hanging loosely from his lips as he appraises you. Across from him sit two others, an elderly Cuban gent in a red suit vest, puffing on a thick cigar, and a dangerous-looking woman in a red dress who sips from a martini glass. All three of them have murder in their eyes.\n“Who are these idiotas?” Mr. Álvarez asks one of the guards escorting you.\n“They asked to speak with you, Desi,” the man stammers.\n“Oh. Well, pour ‘em something hard, will you? Don’t just stand there.” After a quick nod, your escort jaunts out of the room, leaving you with the three apparent Coterie agents. “Come, sit.” You politely turn down a variety of smokes and take a seat at the table. “So you were looking for me?”\nYou nod and inform Mr. Álvarez that he is a person of interest in your investigation, that you knew he often frequented this very bar, and that you were hoping to simply ask him a few questions. Without hesitation, the woman in red pulls a long knife from out of seemingly nowhere. But the man in the suit holds out his hand, and she slides the blade back into her garter belt, covering it with the fabric of her dress."

I guess your intel is a bit outdated, eh?” He chuckles, crushes the stub of his cigarette in a nearby ashtray, and immediately flicks open his lighter to light a new one. “So. Why don’t you tell me about this investigation of yours?”\nYou do, emphasizing that you are only after the location of Keys, and not whatever operation Desi has going on here.\nHis expression sharpens into angular stone. “Right. ‘Keys,’ eh.

Just gone,” he says with a snap of his fingers. “At first, I thought it was just some uppity rivals looking to expand their territory. Fools who don’t know who I really am. The kinda scum who’d run this city into the ground.” He ashes his cigarette, staring into the ashes like there is some greater meaning inside to sift through. “Weird part is, I don’t remember their names. Nobody does. Sounds weird, right? I never forget a name. Never.” His gaze locks with yours, cold as stone. “Now I’m starting to suspect something worse. The kinda thing your people deal with.”\nYou wonder aloud if this is the kind of thing his people are also supposed to be dealing with.\n“Don’t lump me in with the rest of them,” he chides. “I’ve got other fish on my menu. Now—you got two choices. You either help me out with my little problem, or me and my buddies here throw you to the curb. Which is it gonna be?”\nAfter a moment of thought, you tell Desi that you’ll help if he gives you the location of any known Keys and relinquishes any he might have in his possession. The other two Coterie agents lock eyes with Desi in vain, but he has already made up his mind.\nHe extends his hand. “Deal. But I want in. We’ll do this together. Nobody messes with my crew and gets away with it. Come back here tomorrow night—same time, same place.” You nod and depart, booking a room at the Plaza Hotel in Old Havana and getting some much-needed rest before tomorrow’s investigation."

But now…” He shakes his head, forehead wrinkled with worry. “I don’t remember who they were. Nobody does. And it’s more of ‘em every day.

Confirming your suspicions, the door opens without any trouble, and you head inside.\nThe bar is eerily dim and quiet as you make your way to the back room. Having seen what the place looks like during a typical night, full of live music and reveling tourists, you feel a bit unnerved. Your steps echo quietly over the dance floor across from the bar. A nearby stool creaks.\nIt is too quiet.\nYou have no time to process whether you’re in danger. The moment the thought crosses your mind, a hail of gunfire erupts all around you. An ambush! You drop instinctively to the floor, guard your face and cover your ears. The ruckus is deafening. Windows along the front face of the building shatter and send an eruption of jagged glass over the dance floor. The bullets tear through the bar, the booths, the stools; every piece of furniture is ripped apart. You have only seconds to react—"

Not sure who to trust.” He certainly seems to be back to normal. You must have made the right choice. Then again… your mind wanders to the version of Desi who stalked you through the rainy Havana streets, to gunshots and distortions in the sky. You can’t help but continue to scan Desi’s eyes for any sign—any at all—that he is not who he claims to be. You find none. Or perhaps the mimic simply knows how to act now that it has been in his skin for so long? “Well,” he interrupts your thoughts, “I guess I owe you my end of the bargain. ‘Blackbird Solitaire.’”\nYou blink in confusion. “‘Blackbird Solitaire,’” he repeats. “It’s one of the passphrases for my hideout in Ybor City. We rotate passphrases whenever I grant someone in my crew access, which is… rare. Not even the rest of the Coterie knows how to get in. They think it’s just a front, anyway. I think most of ‘em don’t understand what I’m really up to most nights.” As if sensing your next question, a smile crawls along his lips. “Cleaning up the city, that is.” He flicks his cigarette into a wet puddle, not seeming to understand the irony in the act. “Anyway—7th Avenue. Old condemned cigar factory. You can’t miss it. Got at least one of those things you’re after stored inside. Just give it a week or two before they get the message about the new passphrase. Then it’s all yours.” Then Desi loads a new magazine into his Thompson and turns to address his crew. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some imposters to root out.” You decide to leave before you’re forced to know exactly how he plans to do that.",
