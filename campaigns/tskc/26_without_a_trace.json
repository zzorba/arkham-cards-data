After all, if your theory is correct, this ship’s destination does not exist on any map, and for all you know, it might be a one-way journey. Agent Quinn has convinced one of her colleagues to helm the ship, so as to not endanger a civilian, and together you set off for the center of the triangle, hearts in throats.\n“The commissioner will have gotten word by now,” Quinn says, standing with you at the helm of the ship. “Probably the end of my career, I would wager.” She stares off at the horizon as the sun dips just below the waves. Despite her words, her expression is steadfast, without even a hint of regret. “I just hope we find answers.” You concede, with a bit of trepidation, that you almost hope you don’t. The idea of ending up just like the people who have been snatched—it chills you to the core. “Well, no turning back now. Care to do the honors?” she asks, motioning toward the white raven whistle which hangs from a cord around your neck. You pull it off and clutch it in your palm, considering your options."

She speaks in Coptic, her words muffled by whistling wind. “She says thank you,” Quinn translates, “for trusting her.” You wouldn’t go that far. But she seems to know more about where you’re going than you do, and you need every bit of help you can get if you are to survive. Then, just as the wind begins to die down, Aliki Uperetria turns and points over the bow of the ship, seemingly at nothing at all but dark, choppy waves and the dim evening horizon."

Where we are headed, we are going to need all the help we can get.” She glances over the bow of the ship, and you wonder if you are truly headed to another realm, or if you will simply greet the horizon."

Something in the air shimmers—a slight distortion, nothing more—just a trick of the eye—and then, without a moment of warning, the ship is swallowed whole. The clouds burst. Light and color and luster overtakes you, cosmic radiance swathed in transcendental mist. The sight is marvelous and awful, mesmerizing and haunting all at once. You shut your eyes, but colors wash behind your eyelids over and over and over again. Then, finally, what feels like an eternity later, you feel a tap on your shoulder and open your eyes. The sight that greets you is unlike anything you have ever seen.\nAliki was right—if the things that disappeared were taken, this is surely where they ended up: an impossibly jumbled city of twisting architecture and technology both alien and familiar, an unearthly repository for everything that has ever been forgotten and forsaken. A range of sickly purples span the sky above, and snaking throughout the tangled towers and effigies are swirling, shimmering entities of vapor and colorless radiance.\nStunned into silence, you simply stare at the horrifying, awe-inspiring horizon before you, devoid of ocean, devoid of humanity, devoid of life. This is the barren truth to which your investigation has led: The Outside."

We keep this crew tight for a reason, Hudson. Do not lose sight of what is important.” She flips through the documents for a moment, furrowing her brows. “Where is the report on asset 32–J’s cell?”\n“32–J?” the man pulls a small notebook from his back pocket and flips to a page near the middle. “No such designation exists.”\nTaylor grimaces. “No, that’s not right. There was… we met them in London. You were there…” After a moment, she shakes her head in utter confusion. “Hm. Strange. I don’t remember who they were.”\n“You have been working too hard,” the agent replies with a small grin. “Take some time off, Commissioner. We can handle things without you for a week or so.”",

The world wobbles as your vision settles over a new dimension. “Stay with us,” the man says, his voice smoother and more natural than you remember.\nYou demand answers: what was he doing in London, what was that hellish place, and why was he there? “London?” He scoffs. “I haven’t been to London lately. I don’t even know who you are.” You reel. This is for sure the same man you saw in London—isn’t it? “As for that place, I have only a vague sense, but I have no idea what brought me there or how long I have been gone. That thing…” He lifts the brim of his fedora and clutches his forehead so hard his hands shake. “It was… prying. Searching. Learning.”\nAliki finally speaks, with Quinn once again translating. “She says that the creatures are not just taking things, they are… what would be the right word…” she struggles to retain her composure as Aliki once again switches languages. “…adapting. Mimicking.”\nCold realization washes over you. This is what Aliki had been afraid of—why she had come to you for help. The man you saw in London was not the same as the man before you now. It was an imposter. It was one of them.”It seems I am in your debt,” the man says, extending a red-gloved hand. “But unfortunately, I have much to do. If these creatures have infiltrated the Coterie, none can be trusted, myself most especially. If you see me again, assume it is not me. In the meantime, I will get to the bottom of this and confront the others with my findings when the time is right.” You nod and shake his hand. There is more at stake here than you ever realized, and you can only get to the heart of it by working together.",

We were so close!” she exclaims.\nYou struggle in vain to comprehend what you experienced in that other world. Answers may have eluded you, but it’s a relief to stand once more in a place that feels familiar to you. “That place… it is just as you thought,” Quinn says to Aliki, her eyes wide with both awe and horror. “Everything that is missing.
