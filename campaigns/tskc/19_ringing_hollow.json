It’s a host of information regarding missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. “Sound familiar?”\nYou nod and inform Quinn this is precisely the kind of thing that you’d been looking into before you were recruited to the Foundation. You take the time to tell Quinn everything you know regarding the strange entities you have spotted numerous times in your travels, and what their presence does to objects and people alike.\n“That lines up with my research,” she says, motioning to her cluttered table. “But if that’s true, these things have been active for literally hundreds—thousands of years. And we have collectively forgotten everything that has been erased, save for a desperate few that cling to memory. Do you understand what this means?”\nOther than the obvious—that humanity is in very real danger of becoming forgotten history—you aren’t sure what she is getting at.\n“I have a hunch, but I cannot look into it here. Looks like I’m headed back to Britain. I know you have your own assignment to get to, but, if you can spare the time, can you come meet me in Amesbury? It is just due west of London.” Wearing a taut but determined grimace, Quinn gathers some personal belongings and leaves you with more questions than answers."

It’s a host of information regarding missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. You do your best not to let your familiarity with such events show on your face. “Any of this mean anything to you?”\nYou don’t like lying, but telling the truth now would reveal your earlier deception to Taylor. You shake your head, telling Quinn this is new to you. “That checks out. See, that is what’s so hinky about all this. You are holding the only surviving records of any of these places. It is as though all of them were completely eradicated from history. And if that is true, who is to say the same could not happen to us?” She shudders. “The thought of being forgotten like that… even by those closest to me… it is my worst fear.”\nYou tell Quinn that you feel similarly, and that you wish you had more intel to give her. Her gaze, narrow with suspicion, sees right through you.\n“I do not buy that for a second. Taylor might trust you, or maybe she just does not want to get her hands dirty. But I can tell when someone is lying to my face.” A grim silence hangs in the air. Finally, she exhales. “Fine. Do as you will. But if you decide to spill, you can find me in Amesbury, due west of London,” she says, packing some of her files and personal belongings in a small canvas duffel bag. You repeat her destination, curious as to why.\n“Something there I want to look into,” is all she gives you. You suppose it is only fair, considering your hesitance to give her the full story. She gives you no more than a cold glance as she leaves, and you wonder if perhaps you should have warned her. But what she doesn’t know can’t hurt her… right?"
