      "text": "On the train into Hong Kong, Agent Flint shares his current lead with you. “Tzu San Niang is due to meet with her new business partners this afternoon at a local teahouse. From what I gather, they’re a real rogue’s gallery of scumbags. The type that makes their fortunes by exploiting their workers to death. She’s so drawn to these types, it gives me a theory. She’s not just taking these jobs because they pay well. Time and again she goes for these deals where she can help the British at the expense of the common folk. It’s like she’s… attracted to the suffering she causes. Maybe worse.”\nBefore you can discuss this theory in more depth, your train arrives at its stop. You and Flint hurry onto the platform and rush to the teahouse, but you arrive too late: a telltale red parasol is sifting through the street crowd, heading swiftly away. You follow the parasol with your eyes as its bearer steps into a nearby alleyway. Flint whispers to you to stay, but you can’t while your quarry is so close.\nThe moment you enter the alleyway, Tzu San Niang turns and looks you in the eye. “I am used to attention,” she croons, “but I heard you were a little too interested in me.” She raps the tip of her parasol onto the street, and a burst of silvery energy rushes through the ground, jumping into your body. Your skin goes suddenly numb, and you collapse to the ground. The painful pinprick sensation of a sleeping limb takes over your entire body. Tzu San Niang smiles, puts her parasol over her shoulder, and walks away. She gets a few yards away and, apparently believing she is out of earshot, she tells her entourage: “We are done here. The Foundation is on to us. Eliminate them and move on to the Selangor Club harvest.”\nYou hear feet shuffling in your direction, but before any reckoning comes, Flint picks you up and drags you back out to the street, where the crowd and broad daylight might keep you from overt harm… for now. As the sensation in your limbs returns, Flint muses aloud. “The Royal Selangor Club—that’s a social club in Kuala Lumpur. Come on, we have no time to lose.” He helps you to your feet, but you’re still recovering from the blast of energy that sent your body and mind reeling. The parasol isn’t just a Coterie insignia after all—it is a Key!"

      "text": "You meet Agent Flint at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical gardens. He shakes your hand and leans in close. “Do you have a tail?” he asks. You assure him you do not. You have been careful.\nHe updates you on the case while the two of you stroll through the gardens, looking to all the world like normal tourists. He explains that the lady with the red parasol is using the name Tzu San Niang, and that she has made an international business out of helping the British expand their empire, often using the most brutal methods. Her silver tongue and negotiating skills are apparently the thing of legend: she can convince worker unions to tolerate abysmal conditions, local governments to accept the extraction of natural resources without batting an eye, and worse.\n“We can’t be too careful,” Flint warns. “Obviously, Ms. Tzu is no one to be trifled with, but it’s that parasol that’s the key to her operation, if you’ll pardon my pun. I think it actually is giving her the ability to sway minds.”\nYou can’t object—the evidence is piling up. Flint’s initial hunch was right. “What’s worse is that she already suspects we’re on to her. I had a Coterie operative sniffing me out just earlier this week. Luckily, I managed to get the upper hand. Found his safehouse before he found mine. And the best part?” He gives you a sly grin. “He had an itinerary on him. They’re headed to the Royal Selangor Club next. It’s a social club in Kuala Lumpur, for the wealthy elite. Care to join me?”"

You head to Flint’s last known hotel to inquire personally, but they tell you that he never received your telegram. In fact, according to the concierge, he hasn’t been back in several days. You decide that the Coterie must be behind this disappearance, and that the best way of finding Flint is to find the lady with the red parasol.\nFor days you search for signs of the Coterie, but find nothing. You establish the trust of some business contacts and begin to ask them about the lady with the red parasol. Most of them pretend to know nothing, but eventually you hear about a railway being constructed in Malaysia. The rail was delayed, but they sent a negotiator in to reach an agreement, saying “no one says no to her.” Maybe Flint simply went to Kuala Lumpur to investigate on his own, but…\nA lump forms in your throat. You suspect the worst."
