You try to explain yourself as best you can, but you can see from Masai’s body language and tone that he is set against you. After a chilly exchange, he steps onto the porch.\n“Say what you will, but it is clear to me that you are interested in only one thing: power. If Commissioner Taylor had half her wits about her, she should treat you with the same fear as she treats me and my colleagues. None of you understand. None of you understand the great work we must do, as brethren, in order to live freely. One can only control the power of a Key so long before they themselves are controlled.”\nMasai scoffs and takes off his large red spectacles. “You are no better than the worst of us.” He follows your gaze and holds up the spectacles. “These are of no significance. I learned too late of the dangers of holding such power myself. Now leave me in peace.”"

He steps out onto the porch and looks you up and down, as if sizing you up, then nods for you to follow as he walks out to the white-sanded beach. The waves lap hungrily at the shoreline as you walk alongside him.\n“I apologize for my rudeness earlier. I couldn’t be certain of your intentions. And there have been a few… incidents lately,” Masai says gravely. A thick log of smooth driftwood lies buried in the sand in front of you, covered in a swarm of bright red-and-blue crabs. You ask about the incidents.\n“A number of unannounced visits. The Foundation, obviously. Several days before your arrival at Lake Victoria, another member of my organization appeared at our camp, very interested in the key we had recovered. The one with the red gloves.” The professor stops, looking out at the rolling tide. “It bears explanation, I suppose. My survey of Lake Victoria turned up a number of alarming reports. The lakebed is covered in the ruins of a prehistoric city. We registered an alarming amount of carbon dioxide and strange changes in the local flora and fauna around the lake. At its source, we found a machine of alien design. Its purpose and facility are still a mystery, but whatever it was: it was running. Still is.”\nMasai wipes his red spectacles with a handkerchief. “All that to say: several days before you arrived, I found that man sitting in front of the machine, hat off, staring at it. He was humming—well, that’s not quite right—he was communing with it.”\nA shaft of cloud splits the sunlight overhead, casting the beach in dappled shadows. Masai’s voice breaks the silence. “In truth, I did not care to understand why. Why that man does anything has always been a mystery to me. But there was something other about his demeanor. Something altogether wrong.” Masai breathes deeply as the cloud passes, and warm sunlight overtakes the beach. “So imagine my suspicion when even more as yet unknown Foundation operatives showed up at my survey to interrupt my great work.”\nYou ask Masai about this “great work.” He leads you to turn around and begin walking back to his bungalow.\n“It is the work of every person. What is it to be human except to live and help others in this great and perilous world? It’s harder than you might think.” He breathes deep. “If I can leave the world a bit better than I entered it, my work will be done. That is all. It is why the acquisition and squabbling over these Keys is such misdirection. One can only control a Key’s power so long before they become controlled.”\n“But I sense a similar purpose in you,” Masai says. “I will not tell my colleagues we had this conversation, or what I have done with that infernal machine. The Key is yours, until you decide that it should not be. Keep it away from the man with the red gloves at any cost.”"
