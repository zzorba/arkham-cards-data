      "text": "The dark stifles. It moves like a living creature, constricts the air as if you were inside a shapeless cocoon. A figment of your anxious and overactive imagination, you hope. But everything about this meeting puts your nerves on edge. You almost didn’t accept the mysterious invitation, but recent events have forced your hand. It’s been several months since the disappearances began, and all of your leads in Arkham have dried up.\nIt started in the winter of 1924 with several vehicles in Southside: two Studebakers, a Cadillac, and a Rolls Royce, all of them top-of-the-line. One moment they were there, the next… nothing, save for a single deflated wheel. The police believed it to be the work of bootleggers looking for more vehicles to add to their routes, but the cars were too nice, would draw too much attention. Perhaps they were taken down to Boston or New York and flipped for a pretty penny, and that’s just what you figured happened… until the disappearances continued.\nNext to go was a streetlamp outside the Ward Theatre in Downtown. Then, two pets—a dog and a cat, whisked away almost simultaneously right out from under their owners’ noses, not two doors down from one another. You learned the news when you saw the missing posters plastered all over College Street. On a whim, you interviewed the owners. No sign of foul play, and it was unlikely for them to have run away. Something stank about all of it.\nThen people started to disappear. A child from Easttown. A student in Miskatonic University. The chief of Arkham’s fire department. And as the police closed each case with no clues or suspects, a curious thing began to happen. One by one, as time marched on, the things that went missing vanished not only from Arkham, but from memory. The owners of those vehicles suddenly claimed to have never owned them. The pets, the people, all of them were wiped from the memories of every single person in town.\nEveryone but you. You, and you alone, remembered.\nPerhaps it was simply the way of things. Humans are fickle and forgetful by nature. But it couldn’t be so simple. It was just too…strange. Coincidental.\nThat’s when the letter arrived.\n<typewriter>\tGreetings,</typewriter>\n<typewriter>\tI hope this letter finds you well. You do not know me, but I know you. I cannot tell you much through paper correspondence, as it may be intercepted. Suffice it to say that I know of the matters you are looking into, and I also know that you believe yourself to be alone in your investigation. The truth is that you are not alone. Such events are not unique to your city of Arkham. What you have observed is happening in major cities all over the world. I am one of those, like you, who seeks the truth. Who remembers.</typewriter>\n<typewriter>\tThere is another related matter which I must bring to your attention. I need your help, and you need mine. Enclosed is a ticket to a show at the Riverview Theater. If you wish to know more, please meet me there and we can speak further. Come alone.</typewriter>\n<typewriter>\tIn truth,</typewriter>\n<fancy>\t\tLi Flint</fancy>\nThe ticket in the envelope was indeed for a private showing at Arkham’s new movie palace in Downtown. With no other leads and no good reason to avoid going, you have decided to accept the mysterious invitation…"

Inside is a wealth of information regarding cases similar to the ones you have been investigating. Photos of vehicles, factory machines, and public figures, all missing. All forgotten. And just as Flint’s letter promised, the file includes reports from all over the world. London. Shanghai. Bruges. Rio de Janeiro. Cairo. The list goes on and on. “There’s more,” he says after giving you time to read. “Flip to the end.”\nYou do, and what greets you there are two photographs clipped together. The first is of a street in London, distorted by some sort of interference. A light shines above the street corner, and around it, the picture appears to be pinched, like a miniature vortex is pulling reality toward it. The other is a photograph of a man on the other side of that same street corner, ducking into the shadows. He wears a tailored grey suit and a wide-brimmed hat that obscures his face. The only discernible detail you can make out from the photo is the man’s distinctive red gloves. Rare as it is for a photograph to have color, you wonder if the long exposure time is what led to the strange blurring effect. “This was taken by my partner several days ago. Just before he, too, vanished. Whatever is going on, you can be sure that man with the red gloves is somehow involved.”\nGetting to the point, you ask Inspector Flint what exactly he wants from you. “To work together. Share what we know. Sparingly few seem to know the truth.” You agree. If what the man says is true, and events like this are happening all over the world, getting to the bottom of it will require more than just you. “To that end, I would ask that you come to London with me. That man with the red gloves has been sighted in the area, and he’s not alone. I would bet good money that he knows something about where my partner is. Arrangements have already been made. There are steamship tickets in that file. The ship departs from Boston in two days.”"

You lift the lid of the coffin. Inside is an old and forgotten corpse, likely hundreds of years old. Glinting in the dim candlelight, you spot a false ruby eye staring up at you. “A—gift,” the man behind you says quietly. Looking away with disgust, you reach down and pull the marble out of the corpse’s eyesocket. When you turn to ask the man what the object is, he is gone; vanished into thin air like those missing before him. Only there is no mark, no ectoplasmic remains, no evidence of escape. He simply was there, and then he was not.\nBefore you have time to even consider where he could have gone, you hear the telltale rumbling of the secret passageway shifting upstairs once more, and the pounding of heavy footsteps down the stairwell. You arm yourself and prepare for a fight. To your surprise, it is Inspector Flint who greets you, held at gunpoint by a woman dressed in a black suit, wide-brimmed hat, and matching black trousers. She has ebony-dark skin, cold eyes underscored by heavy bags, and short, curly hair. Two other suits flank her, both of whom say nothing and stand like statues as she enters the crypt. She flashes an unidentifiable silver badge and motions for you to stay put. “Where did the man with the red gloves go?” she asks. “And who exactly are you?”\n“Can I put my hands down now?” Inspector Flint says.",

You wonder for a moment if he was somehow erased from existence like the other disappearances, but you don’t believe so. There is no mark. No ectoplasmic remains. He simply was there, and then he was not.\nYou give up searching for him and instead examine the crypt that the man was rummaging through. Inside is an old and forgotten corpse, likely hundreds of years old. You don’t have the object here to do a perfect size comparison, but you are quite sure that the ruby marble the red-gloved man stole before disappearing would have fit inside one of the corpse’s eyesockets. Indeed, examining the corpse, you see that one such socket is covered in webs and sickly with rot, while the other remains strangely smooth on the inside. Whatever that marble is, it must have been what the man with the red gloves sought all along… but why?\nInvestigating further, you find neither name nor epitaph identifying the corpse buried here, only the following lines of what appears to be poetry chiseled into the lid of the body’s coffin:\n<center>With red we are bound.</center>\n<center>Through red we are one.</center>\n<center>Thus in red do we bury our kin and our ken.</center>\n<center>May you rest, until you are needed once more.</center>\nBefore you have time to even consider what this might mean, you hear the telltale rumbling of the secret passageway shifting upstairs once more, and the pounding of heavy footsteps down the stairwell.

      "text": "You wait impatiently for Inspector Flint to arrive, your nerves on edge. Something must have happened to him. But you still remember him—that’s good. You tap your foot nervously as you strain to recall his face, the sound of his voice, the events that led you here. Tap tap tap. Perhaps you should be out there looking for him. What if he is in trouble? Tap tap tap. Maybe he is already gone. Perhaps only you remember him. And what of the man with the red gloves? Tap tap tap. You wait. And wait. And wait.\nYou barely notice the chair across from you sliding out until Flint takes his seat. To your relief, he is unharmed, although you suspect he has not slept in some time. Lines of worry are creased along his forehead, and his eyes are bloodshot and wide with fear. Yours feel the same.\nBreaking the tense air with a joke, you inform Inspector Flint that he is late. He chuckles and nods. “Apologies. Another detective with the ICPC is… missing,” he explains, exhaustion and anxiety giving his voice a bitter edge. “Please tell me you have something for me.”\nYou sigh and give your report. Flint cradles his fingers and rubs them idly as you explain what you have learned. “This proves that the man with the red gloves is not working alone,” he says.\nJust then, a woman’s voice interrupts from across the room. “That is an understatement,” she says, her voice cold and dry. The woman, dressed in a black suit, wide-brimmed hat, and matching black trousers, flashes an unidentifiable silver badge with one hand, and levels the barrel of a handgun at you with the other. She has ebony-dark skin, cold eyes underscored by heavy bags, and short, curly hair. Two other suits flank her, both of whom say nothing and stand like statues as she speaks. Both of them rest their hands on pistols holstered beneath their suit jackets. You realize with sudden terror that you are alone in the once-busy tea room. Everyone else has cleared out. Flint’s hands immediately shoot into the air, and yours quickly follow.\n“Where is the man with the red gloves now?” the woman asks. “And who exactly are you?”\nYou and Flint share a worried glance. What exactly have you gotten yourselves into?",
