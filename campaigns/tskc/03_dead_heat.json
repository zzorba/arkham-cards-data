The man’s boyish frame is offset by a well-kempt grey beard that covers deep laugh lines. “You must be with the Foundation,” he extends a hand to shake. “I am Latif. Please, sit. You must be hungry.”\nThe table is laden with bowls and dishes heaped with eggs, olives, and rich cheese served with flat bread and hot atay. As you eat, Latif spreads a stack of newspapers on the table between you. “I don’t want to ruin your appetite, my friends, but there is some wicked purpose at work in the city.” He points out three different headlines:\n<center><typewriter>MYSTERIOUS TOMB ROBBERY</typewriter></center>\n<center><typewriter>SUDDEN BLIGHT DEVASTATES OLIVE GROVE</typewriter></center>\n<center><typewriter>DOZENS MISSING IN MEDINA</typewriter></center>\nA warm, pungent breeze wafts over you, rustling the newspaper. Latif whispers conspiratorially, “I assume you read the dossier. The one who calls herself Amaranth was seen here, and I believe she is responsible.” Looking over his shoulder, the middle-aged man produces a crisp photo of a beautiful 20-something woman in a black dress and matching gloves, a gaudy blossom tucked behind her ear.\n“Just last night, I sent my contact to gather any information he could on her whereabouts. He hasn’t returned. I fear the worst,” Latif says, looking downcast. “But that is why you’re here, I suppose! The commissioner always sends such…” he looks at you as if considering his words. “Unique people.”\nYou assure Latif that you may be new to the Foundation, but that you are more than capable of handling the situation.\n“I truly hope so,” says Latif, drinking deep from his cup of hot mint tea. “There is something strange happening here. My brother told me he saw our late grandfather walking the street in his burial shroud. I told him that he must have been dreaming, but I have heard similar stories. It is not safe to walk the streets at night anymore. I believe there is some terrible sorcery at work. Some unnatural influence. If only the Foundation did not redact their own missives!”\nYou spend the rest of the morning reviewing the bundle of newspapers and scrivenings Latif has collected. The first “tomb robbery” reported in the recent string of events was of Razin Farhi, a 16th-century philosopher and mathematician. “It is rumored that he was one of the founding members of the Red Coterie,” Latif tells you. Your mind races as you try to piece the information together: is Amaranth after another Key?\n“Whatever is happening, we cannot afford to wait idly,” Latif says."

The man who greets you has a boyish frame offset by a well-kempt beard that covers deep laugh lines. However, he is not smiling. “You’re late,” he says gravely. “I sent a telegram to the Foundation requesting assistance. We are in dire straits, as you say.”\nYou apologize and tell him you’ve done the best you can, and he rubs his brow worriedly. “I am sorry. It is good you are here, but I fear that things are set in motion already. Things we no longer have the time nor power to stop.” He gestures for you to sit. “I am Latif. Please. You will want to sit down for this.”\nA spread of tempting local delicacies has been laid out on the table, but judging from the spare remnants, Latif ate most of it due to nerves. He shows you several newspapers in turn with headlines detailing desecrated tombs, dying crops, and numerous missing persons reports. As he relays these sobering events to you, you catch a scent of something foul on the wind. Looking out across the city, you see a pattern of inky black vines that run across building façades. At a distance, they look like raised veins on a dying body.\n“My friend?” Latif’s voice breaks through your reverie. You apologize, and ask him about the vines. The middle-aged man sighs. “Yet another mystery, it seems. Last night, there was a great commotion outside Bahia Palace. Screaming and gnashing teeth. I sent one of my informants to investigate and he never returned. Soon after, the strange black blooms appeared, growing on every wall and surface. They stink of rot and produce awful, sharp thorns. I wouldn’t dare touch them.”\n“Before this strange business began, my brother told me he saw our late grandfather walking the street in his burial shroud. I would have dismissed it but for the dozens of similar stories. There are now crowds of slow-moving, silent people walking the streets. Their eyes are empty, though their bellies are not,” Latif says bitterly, then drains the rest of his teacup.\n“I believe the one who calls herself Amaranth is responsible. You might recognize her from the Foundation’s dossier. How helpful that they blot out the most important details in their own missives!” Latif produces a crisp photo of a beautiful 20-something woman in a black dress and matching gloves, a gaudy blossom tucked behind her ear.\n“Another of my informants said he saw this ‘Amaranth’ at the Bahia Palace Gardens. Some strange work is afoot, and she is at the center of it. I say we go to the palace and put a stop to whatever awful plans she has in place, but be ready for anything.”\nYou catch a now-familiar scent of rot on the wind, and look down to the lip of the rooftop cafe. A single, black tendril has crept up the side of the building. At the end of the vine, a bulbous, black fruiting body has begun to develop. You aren’t sure if it is a trick of the late morning sun, or if there is some other strange process at work, but you could swear you see a shimmer of phosphorescent green flash along the body, and a noticeable movement, though there is no wind."

Black, dessicated vines climb up the sides of the surrounding buildings and end in riotous red flowers. An eerie silence hangs over everything.\nOn your way to meet your contact, you pass a few, scattered people who walk with a halting, awkward gait. Several of them reach out to you as you keep a wide berth, and you see their skin is jaundiced and dry, and their eyes have a hollow, empty look. A cloud of flies follows in their wake, buzzing incessantly. You are hardly surprised when you find the door to the cafe where you were supposed to meet a “Latif” boarded up.\nTarry death blooms on the walls and storefronts, all hastily barricaded. Fearful eyes peer out at you from between slatted boards. Marrakesh is in utter ruin. After wandering the city, you find the epicenter of the strange black vines lies in the pulverized remains of Bahia Palace. In the overgrown gardens, you find the remnants of a strange ritual, but no trace of those who conducted it."

As her gaze passes over the Last Blossom writhing in your hand, she lets out a cry of horror. “I had the most terrible dream,” she says. “I dreamt I was a great and terrible queen, and that I ruled over a kingdom of silent subjects.” Realizing what she has done, the change in Eryn’s demeanor is jarring. The woman who seemed so heartless and cruel now lies before you, weeping.\nIt is clear to you that Eryn’s actions were not her own. You console her and lead her to safety along with the rest of the survivors, telling her that you will keep the blossom safe and prevent ‘Amaranth’ from taking another host ever again. “Never again,” she echoes your words. “Never again.” As you depart, the blossom furls and unfurls, as if searching for another host.",

Whatever her reasons, she apparently has the ability to bring calamity on an apocalyptic scale.\nAs the people of Marrakesh carry out the grim arithmetic of counting survivors, you use what time you have to help the civilians rebuild. Over the course of many days, the awful vines dessicate and blow away as ash, and the dead are cleansed and wrapped for burial. Despite the devastation, there is hope for the city to become what it once was, if not even better. With a heavy heart, you prepare to leave.",
