Squinting your eyes, you see Amaranth bent over the lion, her cheeks wet with tears. “Khalid, please,” she whispers.

I had no idea you were coming,” they smile brightly, then gesture for you to sit. Drinks and a lavish meal are served, and eventually you steer the conversation toward returning what they stole. “Ah yes. ‘Keys.’ It’s always about ‘Keys,’ isn’t it?” They pour another glass of wine. “Things have changed. I suppose I could be amenable to such an exchange. But only if you make it worth my while.” It takes nearly an hour to come up with compensation enough for Thorne to change their mind, but eventually you leave their sanctum with your stolen relic… and a bit poorer, besides."

Have a drink or two and I’ll play you for it,” he says, shuffling a deck of cards. Seeing your expression, he grins. “Oh, lighten up. I’m not like those others. One hand.
