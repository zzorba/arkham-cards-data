This area is called “the shadows,” and represents enemies the investigators know exist somewhere on the map, but are unsure where. Then, that investigator takes the set-aside concealed mini-card that matches that enemy, along with X decoys (where X is defined by that enemy’s concealed X value), shuffles them facedown, and puts them into play distributed as evenly as possible among each location in play, starting with the locations nearest to them. Then, at each of those locations that already had 1 or more concealed mini-cards, they shuffle each of them facedown as well.\n<i>For example: Amina draws Coterie Agent (A), which has “concealed 2.” She first spawns the Coterie Agent into the shadows. Then, she takes the set-aside Coterie Agent (A) mini-card, along with 2 decoys, shuffles them facedown, and places one at each of the three locations nearest to her. Then, if any of those locations already had 1 or more concealed mini-cards, she would shuffle each concealed mini-card at those locations, as well.</i>",
