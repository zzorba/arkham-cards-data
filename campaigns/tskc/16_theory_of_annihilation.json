I was laughed out of the auditorium when I tried to present. Someone called me a ‘cryptozoologist’.”\nDr. Irawan adjusts her large round spectacles as she turns to a beautifully detailed sketch of a bird roosting in a palm tree. “I presented what I am calling the Theory of Annihilation. A process by which an ecosystem is, itself, devoured via what you have dubbed ‘paranatural selection.’ Not just the ecosystem, but the memory of itself. The fact of its very existence.”\n“Do not worry, I will credit you for that term,” she takes a sip of strong, dark coffee. “But after my recent survey of the Amazon, I am afraid the process is accelerating. A dozen species of macaw have vanished, and my colleagues have no memory of them. The sketches have disappeared as well. Of those we documented, only the scarlet macaw remains.”\nAs Dr. Irawan flips idly through her sketchbook, her eyes catch on a particular page, and her face goes white. “This cannot be.”\nYou ask her what the matter is, and she points to the page. “Just yesterday, this page was not blank. The <i>Phalanger septimus</i>. A cuscus living in the western New Guinea.”\nDr. Irawan begins gathering up her things. “I sketched this subject months ago. Perhaps there will be some trace of it—or of whatever force is behind all this—out in Manokwari.” She pushes a strand of hair behind her ear and smiles at you. “Thank you for listening. Perhaps we will meet again.”"

You tell her you aren’t, and after some coaxing, she opens up to you. “I am actually glad you missed my lecture,” she says. “It was an utter disaster. I was laughed out of the auditorium when I tried to present. Someone called me a ‘cryptozoologist’.”\nYou tell her that there are worse insults. “That may be,” Dr. Irawan adjusts her large round spectacles. “But for my career, it is a death knell.” She turns to a beautifully detailed sketch of a bird roosting in a palm tree. “I presented what I am calling the Theory of Annihilation. The world devouring itself. Not just itself, but the memory of itself. The fact of its very existence.”\nShe takes a sip of strong, dark coffee. “Several years ago, I surveyed the Amazon with a half dozen other well-known academics. We observed dozens of distinct species of macaw, and named each after a stone: turquoise, amethyst, obsidian, the like. But now,” she turns to several empty pages. “There is no trace or record of any of them. My colleagues tell me I made up the Turquoise Macaw and the others. There is no trace of them in their habitat, either. And the sketches have disappeared as well.”\nYou assure Dr. Irawan that she is not mad, and share what little you can about the disappearances.\n“Thank you,” says Dr. Irawan. “I am glad we met. I was beginning to think this was all in my head.” She gives you her business card with the address of a university in Australia written on the back. “I will be in Perth to continue my survey and my next lecture. Perhaps I will see you there.”"
