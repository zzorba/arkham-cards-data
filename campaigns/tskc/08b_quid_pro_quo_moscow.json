      "text": "The Foundation’s base of operations in Moscow is just a five minute walk from St. Basil’s Cathedral: a nondescript door set into a modern constructivist structure overlooking a cobbled street. The corridor inside feeds into a cramped stairwell that descends deeper than you could have anticipated, to a red door set in a flaking whitewashed wall. After identifying yourself, you are led into a long well-lit hallway with lavish carpeting.\n“It seems you follow instructions well,” says a voice. You turn to see a tall, athletic woman in a well-tailored suit. “Valeriya Antonova. We have met before. Call me Lera. Please, follow me.” Agent Antonova leads you through a labyrinthine set of passageways, past a set of double doors, to a white-tiled room flecked with grime and what you hope is red rust. On an operating table in the center, what looks like a person is strapped to a metal slab, restrained with tight leather straps. Looking at the humanoid shape makes your head swim: its features are blurred as if in constant motion, like a hummingbird in flight. You catch only glimpses of its features: a stygian eye, clenched teeth, nervous twitching.\n“Lera,” another agent interrupts. “The Komissar needs your attention.” Agent Antonova looks sternly to you. “This is a paradimensional being. Please keep your distance. I will be but a moment away.” The agent leaves. As you look at the sharp implements mounted to the wall of the lab, you wonder what experiments the being has endured. Judging by the subject’s well-tailored black suit, you wonder if it used to be a Foundation agent. After a minute of silence, it begins to flail around on the table, widening and shrinking its “mouth” to a wide dark O, always facing you. You keep your distance, trying to look away.\n“Please excuse me,” Agent Antonova re-enters the room. The being on the table stops flailing. “There is another matter I must attend to. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to escort you around our facilities, so I must ask you to leave. However, the Foundation does wish to assist in any way it can. Please tell us what we can do for you.”"

Desiderio’s brother was the one involved in such matters, before his murder at the hands of a rival gang. It seems Desiderio then acquired a Key, and was using it to take revenge. Hence the Coterie involvement. Seeing his talent, they decided to induct him.”"
