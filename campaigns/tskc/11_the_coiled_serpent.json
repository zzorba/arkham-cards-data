      "text": "You send a missive to Agent Flint ahead of your arrival, setting a meeting place and time—Jing’an Temple at noon. —and head there as soon as you arrive, entering the broad stone courtyard at the temple’s entrance. After a short while, a tourist approaches you and asks in English: “You’re sure you’re alone?” It takes you a moment to realize that the tourist is none other than Flint, in a subtle yet convincing disguise. He narrows his eyes at your stare. “Answer me,” he says, scanning his surroundings.\nYou assure him that you haven’t been followed. “Can’t be too careful. Eyes everywhere. I have a lead on one of those Coterie types here in Shanghai, just like the Foundation’s intel suggested. They call her ‘subject #46–Q,’ aka ‘Lady with Red Parasol.’ Sure enough, she brings that parasol everywhere she goes. As far as Coterie insignias go, it’s not the most subtle.” While he whispers, he pulls a large camera and tripod from his duffel bag and painstakingly sets up a shot of the temple.\nYou wonder aloud what in the world Flint is up to. “Stop staring,” he hisses under his breath. Then you spot other tourists taking photos as well, and you realize that Flint is better at blending in than you are. “The last time I saw the lady with the parasol, she was leaving a meeting between several wealthy British and Chinese businessmen—railway men,” he says quietly, head still down. “Women aren’t usually allowed at such meetings. Nor are regular citizens. To be in that room, you have to be able to get the attention of those powerful men. Which means you’re either very powerful, or obscenely wealthy.” Flint takes a few photos, then moves to a new spot and starts the tedious process of focusing the camera all over again. “Within two weeks of that meeting, they announced a lucrative new contract. It seems all their competitors were convinced for one reason or another to step away from the project, which left them to write their own ticket. Name their own price.” He slowly scans the courtyard again, careful to move just his eyes and not his head. “Could be she has leverage on them. Or maybe she’s just that charming. But I’m willing to put my money on it being the influence of a Key. If that’s true, it’s imperative that we’re not made.” Flint’s paranoia is infectious."
