      "text": "You arrive in London and follow Agent Quinn’s directions to get to the town of Amesbury. Immediately after checking into a hotel, your concierge wordlessly hands you a note with an address by the side of a park on the western side of the historic town. You head there immediately, only to find Agent Ari Quinn sitting in the driver’s seat of a Bentley, reading a newspaper and not paying you any heed. Without making a scene, you silently climb into the passenger seat. “Finally. Been waiting here all day.” You’re not even sure how Quinn knew you’d arrived in town, but you suppose the Foundation must have eyes and ears all over every harbor and border checkpoint. You ask her what she’s been up to, and what she wanted to show you, at which point she starts the Bentley’s engine and rolls along the road to the west. “You’ll see.” Just a short drive later, you come to a familiar sight. You should have known—Quinn has taken you to the site of mysterious and prehistoric Stonehenge. A ring of standing stones marks the site, inside which another ring of smaller bluestones seem to serve no particular purpose whatsoever. A few tourists peruse the monument in awe, but it is otherwise quiet. You follow close behind and ask Agent Quinn why she asked you to come all this way. “Strange place, is it not?” she asks. A rhetorical question—historians have long debated over the likely function of the landmark, but none know for certain. As you draw nearer, she points to the various standing stones and to the concentric ring of smaller stones inside. “Almost seems like something is missing.”"

Do you understand what this means?” You know a great many conclusions that could be drawn from these events, but you encourage her to continue on her own. “Everything we know, everything we can see, it’s just what’s left. Look at Stonehenge. We have no earthly clue what it is. Maybe that’s because it’s incomplete. There could have been dozens of other structures erected right where we stand and humanity would never know.” She paces back and forth, agitated. “This is my life’s work.

She takes a moment to consider the implications, then nods, resolute. You hand her the whistle Aliki gave to you and tell her that it belonged to a Coterie member who seemed to know only Latin, ancient Greek, and other languages you could not decipher. She studies it for a long while, turning it over and over in her hand. “A white raven,” she murmurs to herself. “The Greek myths tell us that ravens were the messengers of the Gods; Apollo in particular. They were once all white, but when Apollo sent one to spy on his lover, Coronis, he learned of his lover’s infidelity and scorched the raven’s wings black in anger.” You ask Agent Quinn if there is any place in the world one might associate with Apollo or his raven. “There are temples in Rome dedicated to the god Apollo,” she says. “Apollo Sosianus and Apollo Palatinus. Let me know if you head there. I’ll meet you.”"
