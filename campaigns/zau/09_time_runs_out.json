Everything that ever was, everything that ever will be, could be, is here, open to you like the pages of a book. The knowledge, the opportunity, the sheer beauty of it all... it's a lot to take in.\nStill, the moment passes, and the beauty of the scene is marred somewhat by the formless presence rising above it. Aforgomon, god of the minutes and the cycles; an unfathomable being who seeks nothing less than to unmake everything you see here. Mount Hollyoke's disrupted ritual is the fulcrum through which Aforgomon can reach into your universe.\nAnd between this cosmic force and the universe it seeks to annihilate... you.
