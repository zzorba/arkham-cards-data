Tiredness weighs you down like lead, and you want nothing more than to sink into your bed, but your bed perished in flames and sleep is a distant dream. Not to mention that with armed thugs still potentially after your head, you're not sure you'd sleep a wink. \nYou decide to settle for a hot breakfast and a pot of strong coffee at Velma's. While you wait for your food, a confused-looking waitress approaches your table, depositing on it a brown paper package with an envelope taped to the top. \"This is for you,\" she adds unnecessarily.\nThe letter in the envelope is short and to the point: \n<i>They wish to see you dead. I do not. This may help. </i> \nGod knows, you could use an ally, and certainly somebody out there seems to be aiding you from afar. But you hesitate - it could be a trap, and if someone does want to help you, why not show their face?"
