To your surprise, the quiet voice belongs not to a person, but to a black cat that lounges lazily across a tree branch hanging over the path outside the hospital. “Oh, pick your jaws up off the ground and listen.” The cat rises and leaps onto the top of a nearby fence, walking along it with the kind of grace only cats possess.\n“It is one of the cats of Earth’s Dreamlands,” Randolph proclaims, his voice tinged with merriment, like he was meeting an old friend for the first time in ages. “How long it has been since I have spoken with one of your kind!”\nThe cat’s piercing yellow eyes glare at Randolph for a moment before it returns its gaze to you. “…Sure. In any event, I bear a message from your dreaming friends.”"
