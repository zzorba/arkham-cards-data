When you arrive, you find the black cat stuck on a patch of particularly sticky web, wriggling back and forth in a vain attempt to free itself. Even with its sharp claws, it seems to be in trouble. You lean over and pull the cat free, and it leaps from your arms to a rocky platform below, the only thing between the cat and an endless void. It hisses for a moment, then stands tall. “Did I ask for your help?” it scolds. “Well, you made it below the Sea of Pitch after all. Now look around you. See all this webbing?” You couldn’t miss it even if you tried; you are surrounded on all sides by webs, treacherous pathways across the aether. “It is a bridge between your world and the Dreamlands. If it is completed, the two will merge. Understand? Unless you want everything to look like that hospital where your friends are sleeping, you have to stop this at all costs.
