      "text": "It has been more than twenty-four hours since your companions fell asleep. Over the course of the past day, your curiosity has slowly turned to concern and then dread. The problems began when one of your friends started to toss and turn violently in their sleep. You snapped to attention and tried to shake them awake, but it was to no avail. You tried everything. Physical contact was no use, and water did nothing but soak their clothes and bed fruitlessly. Even opening their eyelids did not wake them, and in the process, you noticed that their pupils had fully dilated and their eyes were glazed over with a milky-white fog.\nYou have no idea what this could mean for your friends. Have they managed to find their way to the land Virgil Gray described in his writings? Or has something more sinister taken root within their minds and bodies? Just to be safe, you decide to take your companions to St. Mary’s Hospital. If something ails them physically, perhaps the doctors there can discern what is wrong. Otherwise, you will simply have to watch over them and hope that they return safely to the waking world.\nSt. Mary’s is the only hospital in the town of Arkham, and it is a fixture of its Uptown neighborhood. You explain the situation to Nurse Greenberg, the head nurse at the hospital, who instructs several other nurses to carry your companions into the emergency ward on stretchers. She tells you with a warm, friendly smile that your friends will be examined by Doctor Maheswaran, but other than that, you are left entirely in the dark.\nHours pass. You hear nothing about the status of your companions. You still have not met with Doctor Maheswaran, and you’re starting to grow impatient. You feel something crawling along your arm, and you instinctively brush it away, then wonder if it was an insect or a figment of your imagination. You begin to question whether bringing your friends here was the right choice after all. Eventually, you decide to take matters into your own hands.\nIt is late at night, and the receptionist who instructed you to stay in the waiting room is nowhere to be seen. In fact, there are eerily few people roaming the halls of the hospital. With nobody to stop you, you sneak off into the emergency ward to find your friends. It does not take long for you to find their room. Your companions lie asleep on clean, white cots, their sleep anything but peaceful. They are pale faced and sweaty. One of them tosses and turns in their sleep, their brow furrowed with pain or worry.\nDoctor Maheswaran does not seem surprised by your intrusion. “Shivani Maheswaran,” she introduces herself coldly, without looking up from her clipboard. “You’re the ones who brought them in, right? Before you ask: no, I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life,” she says with a hint of dry impatience. You demand that she tell you everything she knows about their condition and not give you the runaround. With a sigh, she puts her clipboard down and addresses you frankly. “Listen, I may be new to Arkham, but I have seen enough inexplicable maladies in this town to fill entire careers in medicine. I understand why you are concerned. Your friends…” She struggles to find the right words. “They are not simply asleep. It is as if they are hovering somewhere between sleep and unconsciousness, or even death. They are not aware of anything happening around them but appear to be reacting to some kind of internal stimuli.”\nWithout hesitation, you ask if they are dreaming. “Dreaming?” Doctor Maheswaran replies. “It is unlikely, though it might account for their mannerisms. Honestly—and I know this is not exactly reassuring— none of this makes any sense to me, medically speaking.”\nJust then, you see a large, hairy spider crawling on the chest of one of your friends. “Well, that is odd.” Doctor Maheswaran brushes the spider off, and several more emerge from the sheets to take its place. You and the doctor both take several steps back out of pure instinct. You hear heavy footsteps in the hallway outside the emergency ward, and then the lights begin to flicker. “Okay…that is more than simply odd. What in the world is going on out there?” Doctor Maheswaran asks anxiously.\nFor just a moment, you think you hear one of your sleeping companions whisper something. Are they indeed dreaming? And if so, what does their condition have to do with these strange events?"

However, there is no news regarding the hospital at all. Did last night’s events occur too late for the <i>Arkham Advertiser</i> to report on them? Was it all just a bad dream? You put on your coat and head back to the hospital to confirm that what you saw last night was real.\nWhen you arrive at St. Mary’s, you expect to see the building—or perhaps all of Uptown—covered in spiderwebs. But instead, to your surprise, it is perfectly clean. Patients, nurses, and doctors walk through its halls like none of last night’s events transpired. Before you can find your sleeping companions, however, a blond-haired man with heavy bags under his eyes approaches you and places a hand on your shoulder.\n“Good morning. We should talk.”",

      "text": "With panic overtaking your mind and no idea how you can escape, you flee anywhere your feet will take you. Hideous monsters begin to close in around you, and you envision yourself wrapped in webs, waiting to be a spider’s meal. Eventually you come to a dead end: a room covered from floor to ceiling in thick, sticky webs. The skittering of spider legs follows close behind, and you realize you have no hope to escape unless there is a path behind the webs. There is no choice remaining for you. You run headlong into the webs, ripping and tearing at them with the ferocity of a cornered animal. It is tough work, but eventually you see a light behind the webs—perhaps an escape route.\nOnce you cross through the webs, you are no longer in the dark, sterile halls of St. Mary’s, but in a narrow, web-covered cavern. You dare not tarry or go back the way you came, so you run through the dark, cramped cave with no idea where it might lead. Glancing through the cobwebs to your left and right, you see not just hard rock, but the glimmering of lights, like a sea of stars looming beyond the silken threads. Eventually, you emerge from another wall of webs, only to find yourself in an alleyway in Arkham’s Merchant District, near the Miskatonic River. You have neither the time nor the desire to analyze this, instead deciding to put as much distance as you can between you and the hospital. The moment you get home, you collapse from exhaustion.\nThe next day, you wake and check the morning papers, expecting to see tales of chaos at St. Mary’s and of an infestation of arachnids. However, there is no news regarding the hospital at all. Did last night’s events occur too late for the Arkham Advertiser to report on them? Was it all just a bad dream? You put on your coat and head back to the hospital to confirm that what you saw last night was real.\nWhen you arrive at St. Mary’s, you expect to see the building—or perhaps all of Uptown—covered in spiderwebs. Instead, to your surprise, it is perfectly clean. Patients, nurses, and doctors walk through its halls like none of last night’s events transpired. You ask the receptionist if you can see Doctor Maheswaran, but he shakes his head. “I’m sorry, but I don’t think she’s here today. She left in the middle of her shift last night, and nobody has seen her since. Is there somebody else I can reach for you?”\nSomething is not right. None of this makes any sense. You are about to demand to see your sleeping companions when a blond-haired man with heavy bags under his eyes approaches you and places a hand on your shoulder.\n“Good morning. We should talk.”",

The man, whose name is Randolph Carter, tells you that he is a “dreamer,” like Virgil Gray and your friends: one with the ability to traverse the divide between the waking world and a parallel dimension that was created by, is sustained by, and dwells within the dreams of all living organisms on Earth—a realm he calls <smallcaps>The Dreamlands</smallcaps>. “It is a place of both dreams and nightmares,” he explains. “And I’m afraid your friends are trapped there as we speak.”\nYou ask if there is anything you can do to aid them. Randolph ponders this for a moment, then replies: “Normally, dreamers can return to the real world simply by willing themselves awake, but for some reason, your friends are unable to do so. If you truly wish to help them, you too must enter the Dreamlands and find them. But forcing your way into the Dreamlands is not easy. Such paths are usually accessible only to experienced dreamers, and only in sleep. Still, there are some places where the Dreamlands touch the waking world, and in those places, with the right tools, you may enter the Dreamlands in your physical body. I know of such a place, not far from here. However—”\nBefore Randolph is able to finish his sentence, he is interrupted by a mysterious voice…",
