You look to Randolph to make sure he is okay, and it is then that you notice he is not climbing above you as you had suspected he would. You look up to find your companion scowling at you from above, a blade of onyx in his hands. He has cut a segment of the web upon which you are climbing.

Finally, after miles and miles of restless travel, you push aside the stone slab at the top of the tower, and you emerge in the Enchanted Wood. You seal the entrance behind you. Nothing from the hellish Underworld can follow you here. For the first time since entering the Dreamlands, you breathe a sigh of relief.

You are fated to wander this hellish world-between-worlds, searching in vain for any hope of escape. Your only solace is that you have prevented this cruel future from being that of every person on Earth. Perhaps if you still possessed the Silver Key, you might have had a way out. Try as you might, in this dismal, cavernous void below the bottomless Sea of Pitch, you cannot muster the will to forge your own.",

So, with your task complete, you begin the long climb towards reality. You are lucky that remnants of the web-bridge still remain intact, or you would have been stranded in this hellish world between worlds. It takes many hours for you to retrace your steps to the Underworld. You eventually emerge from the thick, tar-like Sea of Pitch, close to the shoreline. To your dismay, you realize that you are on the opposite shore of the sea from the dark vale from which you once embarked. With no way to cross the deadly sea, you'll have to find another way out of this barren expanse. Days pass as you continue to explore the Underworld, reaching darker and more forbidden lands as you travel deeper and deeper below the crust of the Earth's Dreamlands. Though you eventually find a stairway up, it is very different from the one leading to the Unnamable: a spiraling otherworldy series of steps that reach dizzying heights and break all laws of reality. When you reach the top, your heart sinks. There is no sign of Arkham here. You are greeted instead by a strange, ruined city and its half-human denizens. The creatures inform you that you have reached the lost city of \"Sarkomand.\" It appears your return journey is far from over.",
