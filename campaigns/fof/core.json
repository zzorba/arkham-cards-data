If an effect raises an investigator’s alarm level by any amount, place that much doom on that investigator’s card to represent this. Likewise, if an effect reduces an investigator’s alarm level by any amount, remove that much doom from that investigator’s card. <b>An investigator's alarm level cannot be reduced below 1 or raised above 10.</b>\nEven though it is marked using doom tokens, an investigator’s alarm level is not doom, and does not count toward the agenda’s doom threshold.\nAn investigator’s alarm level has the following additional effect:",
