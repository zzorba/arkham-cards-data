For getting it out of Abarran's hands. And getting it away from this place. I don't know what would have happened if you didn't. Tonight was bad enough, but nothing would have stopped Abarran from holding tight to his prize, no matter how many died along the way.\" You begin to gather your things, as Isamara does the same. You know that you will need to leave Monte Carlo immediately, as any of the Fortune's Chosen who have survived, including Abarran himself, will hunt for you and the Wellspring. \"I saw him one last time, before we escaped,\" Isamara explains, \"The look of rage in his eyes... Without his precious artifact he'll be even more unstable.\" You tell her that maybe he is the one that should be scared instead. After all, she successfully orchestrated his downfall from within. At your words, that same smile crosses her face once more. \"I could get used to that idea.\" With everything ready to go and the Wellspring in hand, you leave Monte Carlo behind, hoping your luck will hold.",

More than ever, it seems that some person or group helped Abarran set up his operation here and is protecting him after the fact as well. More importantly, after your attempted heist and the strange dimensional incursion, Abarran has taken the Wellspring somewhere far from here.
