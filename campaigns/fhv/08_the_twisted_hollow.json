I swear on his precious little grave, if I find that boy plucking violets and reciting poetry, I will have him expelled,” Dr. Marquez almost spits the words as she leads you to one of the Vale’s supply sheds. Searching the village yielded no results: Just a pile of books and Bertie’s leather satchel in his room at the boarding house. Nobody seems to have seen him since the morning.\nThe professor opens the rickety shed and grabs an old barn lantern from an iron hook. “Look for oil,” she says gruffly. You mention the locals’ warning against going out at night, and the professor raps her cane on an empty oilcan. “All the more reason to find Bertie.”\nA long shadow falls across you both, and you turn to see Mother Rachel silhouetted against the sunset. “You all left so quickly after dinner. Is there something I can help you find?”"

Stay in the light, and you will find the way much safer.” She leads you to the edge of the forest as the sun sets. The forest air is unnaturally thick, and you find it hard to breathe, but you follow the matron nonetheless. Eventually, Mother Rachel leads you to a broad, open field and gestures to the tenebrous shadows. “From here, you take your lives into your own hands. The people of the Vale will pray for your safe return.”\nHazy lights dance above the meadow’s yarrow and asters. Mother Rachel points into the murky abyss. “If all else fails, return to the fireflies.”"

Finally, you find a chipped mason jar with just a fifth of oil. “We can make it if we portion every bit,” the professor says. You follow the dim lantern light into the maw of gnarled trees toward a quiet stream, then further up and further into the dark.\nEventually, you reach a collapsed bridge and overgrown cobblestones in the ruins of an old village. The trees overhead rustle. “Something’s there,” Dr. Marquez raises her lantern. A pair of beady eyes reflect the light, but quickly vanish in the murk.\n“Watch yourself and keep close. There’s no telling what’s out here.”"

Summoning all your strength, you stagger to the edge of a black lake. The waxing moon is perfectly reflected on the surface of the water, distorted by oily, iridescent whisps of a strange color. Across the lake, a figure stands outlined in the mist. You call out to it, and it moves slowly toward you, over the water. As it approaches, all you can see of its face is a wide, rictus grin.\n“So help me, please wake up!” Dr. Marquez shakes you awake from the nightmare. Her worry quickly turns to annoyance when you open your eyes. “I’m glad you woke up. I wasn’t prepared for the paperwork if we lost you, too.” You are in a flowering field at the edge of the woods. When you ask about Bertie, she brushes a stray hair behind her ear and looks up at the waking dawn. “He’s gone. I lost him.”",

The sight of the brilliant carpet of blue and white nearly takes your breath away after the oppressive darkness. Perhaps it is just your tired mind, but the heather and flowers seem to pulse. “Look,” Bertie points with a trembling hand. A dozen luminous stalks rise like floating lamps over the meadow, glimmering in the moonlight. “I feel almost as though we are walking amidst the cosmos. That each of us is a little god.” He plucks a glowing bud from its stalk. “And each of these, an even smaller star.”\nDr. Marquez slaps the flower out of his hand. “That poetic drivel is what got you lost in the woods. We risked life and limb for you! You’ll be lucky if I leave this incident out of the survey report.” Bertie hangs his head in shame as the professor lists a litany of woes and misdemeanors. But still, you can’t help but note the concern in Dr. Marquez’s voice as she excoriates her assistant. As you return to the Vale, the sky stirs with the coming dawn.",

I’m so sorry I caused you so much trouble. Say a word for me back in the Vale, will you?” Before you can intervene, Bertie snatches the lantern out of your hands and shouts into the darkness: “Come on, you ugly git!”\nThe bear roars in response. Glowing blue spores scatter in the darkness around it, wreathing the creature in pale blue light. Bertie lets out a brave yell in response and barrels toward it. Realizing the young man’s sacrifice, you take advantage of the distraction to slip away and get to safety.",
