But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people,” he laughs. “I’m sure there’s something to it. Rumor is, there’s some kinda infestation in there. Rats, probably. Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. It’s an old house, y’know? Lots of nooks in the walls, places for them to hide. Brother William asked Ms. Park to find and repair ‘em, clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls, but she hasn’t gotten around to it yet. I still got all those supplies in my truck, if you feel like helping out.”\nYou unload several planks of wood, a box of tools, and a bucket of some foul- smelling chemical mixture from the back of Theo’s truck. As he drives off, you stare up at the crumbling manor. There is something crooked and unsettling in the arrangement of its windows, the slant of its gambrel roofs. The house’s previous grandeur has not set right with the landscape, perhaps by some crack in its foundation—or, if the rumors are right, whatever lives within its walls."

But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people,” He laughs. “I’m sure there’s something to it. Rumor is, there’s some kinda infestation in there. Rats, probably. Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. It’s an old house, y’know? Lots of nooks in the walls, places for them to hide. Gotta be even worse with all this rain.”\nHaving seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle, you know better than to assume the house’s other inhabitants to be mere rats or raccoons. You ask Theo what Mr. Hemlock wants done to the place, which elicits a brief chuckle. “He asked Ms. Park to repair the place and clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls. They’re both there right now, I think, if you wanna help out or chat with them. Can’t believe he still thinks the place is salvageable, but hey, who am I to judge?”\nTheo drops you off in front of the crumbling manor so you don’t have to plod through mud and rain. You shudder as you glance up at its crooked frame. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its gambrel roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls."

      "text": "“Considering what Brother William was prattling on about last night at the dance? Yeah, maybe it is haunted. I dunno.” Theo sighs as his truck pulls to a stop in front of the towering, shingle style manor. Dark clouds loom over its gambrel roofs, its frame crooked and misshapen. Its attic truss is burnt almost to the frame, its outer wall exposed to the elements by extensive fire damage. “Old Gideon says a lot of things about this place. But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people. Still...” Theo sighs, shaking his head. “Maybe there is something to it all. I thought if there was an infestation, it was probably rats, y’know? Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. But Brother William looked downright terrified when he came back into town yesterday. Who knows?”\nYou ask Theo what Mr. Hemlock was doing here—perhaps you can help figure out what’s wrong with the place. “Last I checked, he asked Ms. Park to repair the place and clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls. That was a couple days ago. Ms. Park’s still here, but after yesterday I don’t think Brother William’s gonna be venturing anywhere near this place until it’s cleaned up.”\n You point the fire damage out to Theo, who gives a whistle in response. “Yeah, that’s new. I did hear some pretty close thunder during that storm last night. Wouldn’t be surprised if that was from lightning. Lucky the rain must’ve put the fire out.” You wonder if it was in fact fortune that kept the old manor standing, or something else entirely. As if in response to your ruminations, something slithers just out of view from the exposed floor of the attic. You ask Theo if he saw it, but he only shrugs. “Saw what? You don’t plan on heading up there, do you? Be careful. This place was decrepit even before the storm.” He turns the ignition off and gets out of the truck, joining you under the awning of the manor’s front porch. “I’ll come with, ok? I won’t go all the way up there, but just in case something happens, I’ll be here.”\nYou nod. Having seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle, you know better than to assume the house’s other inhabitants to be mere rats or raccoons. It might be nice having Theo and his truck on hand for a swift exit. Taking in a deep breath, you glance once more at the manor’s crooked frame. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls.\nUpon entering the house, you immediately climb its inner staircase up to the attic, leaving Theo downstairs. Scarred by fire damage and partially exposed to the wind, the decrepit bedroom bears no trace of whatever creature you saw from below. With each of your steps, the old building groans precariously. You cannot help but wonder if it is in fact the rumbling of an empty stomach..."

From what you’ve been told, the old Hemlock House is infested with something or other—what exactly is a matter of some debate. Before lending you his truck for the night, Theo made mention of rats in the walls, or potentially wild animals taking refuge from the woods, not to mention the storm brewing on the horizon. But you’re not so sure. After all, you’ve already seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle—you know better than to assume mere rats or raccoons to be the issue.\nApproaching the crumbling manor, you find a stockpile of supplies tucked away near its entrance: several planks of wood, a box of tools, and a bucket of some foul-smelling chemical mixture. According to Theo, Mr. Hemlock had asked Judith to try to fix the place up and clear out whatever was infesting its walls. Seems like she hasn’t gotten very far yet. You look up at the house’s crooked frame, set against a backdrop of dark stormclouds. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its gambrel roofs.

There’s no ‘legacy’ here. Just a bunch of ugly furniture, and whatever creature has taken up residence.” You ask what she thinks should be done. “It’s too dangerous to be left alone as it is.” She may be right—it would surely upset William, but left as is, this house is a danger to him and the rest of Hemlock Isle."
