I mean, I’m sure it’d kill us if it saw us. But, well,” he waves his hand. “I’m glad I found you. There was something moving down on the shore, but I didn’t bother checking.

The reptile moans as you lift the glowing gray blossom from its back, then opens its mouth to expose rows of serrated teeth as it snaps at you. Arsenic white fluid spurts from the hollow stem, coating you with a stinking secretion that burns your skin. You nearly drop the blossom as you stumble back, realizing your mistake. The vapors from the fluid make you dizzy and lend the forest an exaggerated fluorescence. The poor reptilian creature flails in pain and sinks, leaving swirls of milky blood on the surface. A sharp pain forces you to drop the alkaloid blossom, and you examine your hand to find a sharp cut on your palm. The shape of the wound suggests the stem had begun to penetrate the flesh. You put the sample in a specimen jar and head for the southern shore.",

I don’t know why the villagers aren’t more afraid. I can guarantee you this turtle...thing doesn’t just munch flowers.”\n“If you shoot the thing I came here to survey, you will not be paid,” Dr. Marquez says coldly. The professor pulls out a notebook and begins sketching the creature. A hush falls over the group as a pair of frogs swim across the pond in front of the creature. In an instant, the chelydran hybrid opens its mouth to expose 4 separate rows of teeth lining the back of its throat, then snaps up both frogs.\nDr. Marquez puts down her sketchbook. “What in the hell—”",
