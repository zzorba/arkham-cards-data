The long building’s large barn doors are open to let out the rich scent of roasted vegetables and savory meat. The people of the Vale sit and eat in lively conversation, each of them in their white-gold cloaks. At the head of the room, Mother Rachel stands up and calls for attention. Rebecca leads you to the now-picked-over dinner spread as the room falls silent.\n“<i>Meine lieben Freunde.</i> What a blessing that all of us have come here, on the threshold of infinity. And what a greater blessing still that pilgrims have come here, so full of light and curiosity!” Mother Rachel gestures to Dr. Marquez to her right, and to you. “We have waited for the right moment to open our community. Our community which is truly the ‘Sanctuary of Transfiguration’ we long dreamed of. For each of us yearns to be remade as we wait to join our light with the light of the cosmos.”\nThe room bursts into applause as Leah Atwood and several locals place trays of honeyed cakes topped with robust red fruit in the center of each table. Your stomach grumbles as you take a bite of shriveled greens. It has a faint bitter taste, and a sharp smell."

The sunset casts the sky in shades from ochre, to lilac, to violet. The professor cracks a handful of walnuts as you share your impressions of Hemlock Isle.\n“This island has the density and special variance of a jungle, but it’s far more dangerous than any jungle. I have no clue why someone would start a commune in such a hazardous environment, but I understand it wasn’t always so deadly. Something was introduced and fundamentally changed the local ecosystem,” Dr. Marquez muses.\nYou mention the unusually good mood shared by everyone in the village, and the professor nods. “Most everyone looks blissed out of their minds. It’s like walking into an opium den. But as far as I can tell, the food isn’t laced with anything. Though I didn’t try the bread pudding. I’ve never liked bread, and the last time I had pudding was in Oxford.”\nThe professor’s reference to the prestigious university brings Bertie Musgrave to mind, and you ask where he is.\n“You haven’t seen him? I assumed he went back to the boarding house to rest,” she scowls. “Theo offered to lend us his truck for the evening. I thought we could observe some of the local wildlife at night, but I suppose we should find him first.”\nA heavy breeze stirs the trees and grass around you, smelling of cedar and pine. Dr. Marquez grips her cane. “If you’d rather take the truck and continue the survey, I can look for Bertie on my own.”",
