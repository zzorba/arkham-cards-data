After hiking the steep incline, the professor lets out a gasp.\nRows of crystalline trees shimmer in the light. A crack of lightning from the southern clouds refracts a band of gorgeous, prismatic radiance through hanging apples and knotted glass trunks. Although beautiful, you can’t help but feel an anxious pang: the trees are wondrous, but they are long dead, frozen in time. Dr. Marquez begins chipping away at a young sapling with a hammer and chisel. “Fan out and explore the ruins. Leah warned me to keep clear of the ants, whatever that means. Don’t kick any anthills, I guess.” she says, already engrossed in her work."

      "text": "Once you have left Pearl Ridge behind, you study Susan Pearl’s diary. The account chronicles the rise and fall of Susan Pearl’s investments in agriculture and mining on Hemlock Isle in the decade leading up to 1906. The business entries are interspersed with prayers, illustrations of birds, and occasional details on the strange “Warrens” underneath Pearl Ridge. Other entries mention spreading sickness in the orchard workers and the Pearl family, along with repeated hardship in their mining efforts. The last entry, written in a long, erratic scrawl, catches your attention:\n<blockquote>I am still not certain if what I experienced was a dream or vision. At midnight, I awoke to the uncanny feeling of being watched, and when I opened my eyes, I saw a pale sphere of watery light in the corner of my room, dancing like something in a faery story. As soon as I laid eyes on it, the thing flew out the window, and I followed it out into the orchard. What I saw is something I can only describe as a miracle: A hundred more faery lights danced in the orchard. As I watched the lights, they grew brighter, and I felt almost as though I was flying. A heady bliss took over my mind, and I felt different, somehow. As if there were another me—five other me’s—beating within my chest. And as I looked out at the trees, I saw myself in them, too. In all of this. Strong and thick with knotted skin and branches for arms. I saw myself, my place, in all of creation. And all of my fears—for Ezra, for the mine, for our health—melted away. I knew only joy. Such joy!\nI am the eyes. All eyes that see. I am the brilliance.\n<right><fancy>Susan Pearl. June 22, 1906</fancy></right>\n</blockquote>",
