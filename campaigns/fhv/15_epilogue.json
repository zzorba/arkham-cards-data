An alien presence dominated the local ecosystem, warping the physical and mental wellbeing of every living thing in its proximity. We witnessed species that have never been documented before, and likely never will be again. The locals coexisted with this presence for decades, seemingly or intentionally unaware of its degenerative effects. Some even worshiped it. We count ourselves lucky to have survived.\nDr. Marquez, unfortunately, was not so lucky. Enclosed with this letter is a comprehensive account detailing her observations of this unique ecosystem. What it does not contain is the story of how—and how bravely—she gave her life. That is a story we wish to share with you in person. We ask, out of respect for her memory, that you not dismiss these records as mere fantasy. Faithfully yours,\n<right><fancy>The Miskatonic Survey</fancy></right>"

You’re really headed back there?” She goes quiet for a moment as if considering something. “You’re going to need someone to watch your back,” she ventures.
