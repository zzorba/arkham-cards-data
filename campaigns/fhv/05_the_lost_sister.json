Cold Atlantic seawater laps at the stilts below the house as Helen Peters sets her steaming mug on the table. “The north shore caverns are a death trap,” she says firmly. “I don’t think you know what you’re getting into.”\nYou tell her you are well aware of the danger. According to local rumors, some folks have gone missing recently. The most recent disappearance was Helen’s sister, so you paid a visit to the Peters home to offer your help.\nHelen looks you over, as if sizing you up, and finally nods. “Alright then. You’re either brave, or you’re stupid. Or you’re both, like my little brother.” She rubs her brow in frustration. “I last saw Lizzie—Elizabeth—taking a walk with our dog Bruce along the coastline. I told her to stay away from those caves, but she never listens. It’s easy to get lost in ‘em and there are things in there that’d haunt your nightmares.” She sets a flashlight on the table. “But that’s where we’re going to start.”"

Nestled in a small, rocky bay on the island’s northern shore, Akwan has been the home of Abenaki families and former whalers for generations. The steady swell and break of seawater on the stony shore lends the scene an eerie disquiet. Helen grabs a harpoon from a whaler’s shack and leads you to the beach.\nA familiar old pickup truck slows to a stop nearby. Theo steps out and greets you with a broad smile. “I’m back! I had to run back to the Vale for something,” he waves. His smile vanishes when he sees Helen.\n“I’m surprised you came,” Helen says cooly.\nTheo looks crestfallen. “Of course I came, sis. How could I not?”\nHis sister says nothing as she strides past you both toward the bleak shoreline. A curl of waves crashes against the walk, breaking the apparent drama of the moment. You ask Theo for the reason behind his sister’s chilly response, and he looks distant for a moment.\n“Y’know, sometimes people just grow apart. Like two branches. They’ll always be connected, but they—” The extended metaphor is interrupted by Helen, calling you to the mouth of a seaside cave."

Better late than never, I guess. Get the rope.” She slings a harpoon over her shoulder and walks out into the pouring rain. Theo scrambles for rope and a second flashlight as you ask him what the matter is.\n“Our sister is missing. I told Helen she would come back, and now it’s been two days. That’s, uh. That’s what the matter is.”"

I thought this could be our home, but I guess it’s just another stop on the way,” Helen says wistfully. The village is all but deserted, save for an old sailor in a navy blue coat. He nearly drops his fishing rod as you approach.\n“Gideon! Fishing again?” Helen says with a wry smile.\nThe old sailor pulls his haul out of the water. “Nae but an ugly cod. An’ this e’en uglier haddock.” The fish strung through the twine have too many fins and spined, barnacle-like growths. “An ye, Helen?” Gideon asks.\nHelen tells the old sailor about her missing sister. The old sailor looks concerned. “Little Lizzie’s quite the treasure. I’ll help, if ye’ll have me.”"

You ask what their plan is now.\n“We can’t stay here,” Helen says, more to Elizabeth than to you. Before her sister can protest, Helen goes on. “Remember the story Nokemes told us? The one about Gluskab turning a man into a tree. Everything on this island is wrong. It’s transformed into something deadly. Maybe it’s time we pay a visit to Uncle George in Portland.”",

Now they’ve taken Theo.”\nShe looks back to you. “I have another favor to ask. Please. Look after Theo. He means well, even if he’s a little thick in the head. Make sure he’s okay.
