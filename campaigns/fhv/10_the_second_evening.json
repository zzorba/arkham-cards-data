It’s only here.” She produces a creased map of the island and points to the north hills. “Pearl Ridge hasn’t recovered in the past twenty years since it was obliterated.”\nMarquez holds up two rings of glassy wood from both Eastwick Bog and Pearl Orchard, then draws a ring around Pearl Ridge on her map. “The bitter eggs this morning reminded me of a report after the Tunguska event. A meteorite obliterated miles of Russian countryside, but the effects on the locals were even more devastating. Stores of food were poisoned. Livestock perished. Nearby villages were slowly deserted as families who lived there for generations died of starvation or worse.” She draws a larger concentric circle around the first.\n“Nobody has said anything about a meteor, but judging by the massive sinkhole in front of the Pearl Estate, something emerged from the rock. My working theory is that the mining operation opened a vein and released whatever poisoned gas or mineral affecting the island.”\nDr. Marquez’s expression goes grave. “There’s something else.
