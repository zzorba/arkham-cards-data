Twisted stalagmites furl and unfurl into spirals, reaching up toward the ceiling like the stalks of some antediluvian flora. Screams fill the air: the cavern floor is covered in revelers clutching their limbs or heads. Cracks of shining light form on their skin and grow in intensity. Everything in the shining chamber is distorted by a gelid phosphorescence. You feel as though you are breathing heavy smoke in the thick warm air.\nEphemeral forms whorl around an empyrean brilliance at the center of the chamber. Silhouetted in front of the core of pure white light is Mother Rachel, her hair unbound and floating as if in deep water. Your head pounds as you stare into the brilliance, and you look down at the cavern floor. The injured revelers have stopped moving, and have gone gray and powdery. A few are clear as glass, refracting the clear light of the abyss into prismatic arrays. Others stand, petrified, holding their arms out toward the brilliance, each face frozen in a ghoulish smile.\nThe sound of Mother Rachel’s laughter echoes through the chamber as the matron stares into the abyss, holding her arms up overhead. Smoke gathers around her as her body dissolves into gas. Unsure of what is happening, you run up a hill of petrified human forms toward Mother Rachel and the abyss. Bones and dessicated corpses crack underfoot as you clamber to the top. Mother Rachel looks at you, exultant, before her body sublimates into pale fire.\nAn all-too-familiar euphoria floods your senses as the alien light pulses and bends the chamber around it. You feel an invisible hand on your shoulder; you brush it away. Something feels different. You hold up one hand to see a small, spidery crack of light form on your palm. The fissure lengthens to creep up your wrist, then your arm. The accompanying pain sends you into a dead faint.\nYou wake up and you see yo urs e lfst an d in ga ttheed geo fab road chasms ta rin g dOwn yoU sEe y our sel Fin the bod yof abl ack ca Tan dAsaq UeEnaswim Mi nGth Inga CrAwlIngchA otIc dA rkNes Sw Hoare youaNdWHYaRe yOuhEre?"

The silver light spirals weakly off into the distance. Your heart is heavy as you clutch Dr. Marquez’s satchel: all that is left of the professor, as far as you know.\n“Is anyone down there?” calls a shaky voice. You look up to see the silhouette of one of the Vale residents, wearing a tattered white-gold cloak. They have the look of someone who has awoken from a bad dream. You hesitate, but then call back. After a minute, a thick rope drops down, and you are hauled up to stand in the splintered wreckage of Hemlock Vale. The survivors gather around you. “Please, if you can find it in your heart, forgive us,” one says. Another sheds their mask and tattered cloak. Past the edge of the crowd, you think you see a familiar rabbit mask peeking out from the shadows, but when you turn your head to look, it has already vanished.",
