      "text": "As you approach Atwood Farm, the clouds recede to reveal a blood-red sunset that casts the landscape in hazy shadows. You follow Dr. Marquez past a neglected coop and barn to the back porch of the derelict farmhouse. As the professor jams a crowbar under a boarded window, you notice the revolver in her back pocket. “Just some insurance,” she says.\nIt takes some time to pry the boards off the windows. As you climb in after the professor, your senses sting with the scent of rot and sick. Once your eyes adjust to the murk, you see a harrowing scene. Dirty cots line the walls, and the floor is streaked with refuse. A dozen sickly people lay on cots and sit, slumped against the walls. Their skin is knotted and hard, riddled with sharp spurs and sinewy growths. Several of them have limp flaps of loose flesh that you soon realize are vestigial limbs. Others look up at you with glassy eyes, while others with gray, powdery skin lay, inert, staring up at the ceiling.\n“You shouldn’t be here,” says a voice. A balding man in a tattered Vale cloak steps toward you with a halting gait. Dr. Marquez squints in the dim. “Tad? From the general store?” Before he can answer, you hear voices from the front porch. You and Dr. Marquez dash behind a pile of broken furniture just as the front door clicks and swings open. Mother Rachel enters alongside a half dozen cloaked figures and several more sickly locals.\nThe matron addresses the room, beaming. “My Star Children. Your time has come at last. You will prepare the way.” She leans down and holds a wheelchair-bound woman’s hand. “All of you have been made whole. And now you will join your other selves in eternity.”"

We have been remade beyond the concerns of conventional medicine. I understand it may seem foolish, even cruel, to an outsider, but each of us is here of our own volition. Even you.” The room nods along in agreement.\n“You’re being deceived! Can’t you see?” Dr. Marquez says, furious. “These people are dying!” You search the room, hoping for some support."

Please, return to the Vale.” Dr. Marquez glowers in response. Mother Rachel’s eyes well with tears as she leaves with her procession.\n“What did she mean by ‘ fulfill your place in creation’?” Dr. Marquez asks Tad as he rubs scaly growths from his forearms. The balding man smiles. “Tomorrow, the blood moon heralds our ascension. But tonight, on the shortest night of the year, all the creatures of the forest and fields will help us complete our journey.”\n“I’m sorry, but that doesn’t answer my question,” the professor replies.\nTad grins. “We will all be devoured. It is our place to make this sacrifice.” As he looks to the horizon, a chorus of mournful howls echoes across the fields.\nThe professor looks at Tad, horrified. “Like hell you will,” she says. You follow her outside. Dark shapes stand outlined on distant hills. The professor is briefly lost in thought, then takes a sharp breath. “I doubt any of them are in their right mind. But maybe if we hold out long enough, we can get them proper care and attention.” You look past the farmhouse to the rolling fields. You don’t have time to evacuate the captives before sunset. Moreover, you don’t have any guarantee they’ll follow you. But you have to try.\nTogether, you and the professor scavenge the collapsing farm for spare parts. You find scraps of wood, barbed wire, and old trapping equipment to fortify your position. If you can outlast the night, some of the captives might be saved. A hideous baying breaks the still air as the sun sets.\nThe shortest night of the year just became the longest."

Dr. Marquez stops and runs a hand under the brittle leaves. “The fields are painted with blood. But why?” She wipes the blood on a handkerchief and surveys the dripping field. “What kind of monster would do this? Sentencing her followers—her own daughter—to death. It’s almost biblical.”\nRebecca pulls back her mask and shakes her head. “Mother says it’s our way. And she doesn’t want me to die. She told me to hide. She said we were playing a game. ‘Make yourself very small and hide near the barrels of kerosene. The animals won’t smell you there’.”\n“But why bring you here at all?” the professor asks.\n“Some people didn’t want to come to the barn. But when mama told them I would be there too, they said it was okay.”\nThe group falls silent as you pass from one field and back into view of the Vale, veiled in gold under the radiant dawn. Suddenly, Dr. Marquez stops and takes you aside. “We may be able to use this as leverage. Rebecca is living proof of Mother Rachel’s hypocrisy, as horrible as that sounds. Everyone on Hemlock Isle will be at the Feast tonight. If we ask Rebecca to tell them what Mother Rachel said to her, we may be able to sway at least some of them to leave. And if that doesn’t work, we can high-tail it back to the mainland and get the law involved.”\nThe professor turns to Rebecca. “Can we play a game? Like last night? Your mother told me she wants you to hide until the Feast.” The young girl nods. Dr. Marquez lets out a manic giggle: strangely out of character for her usual controlled affect. You can’t help but suppress a grin, too, despite the horrors you just witnessed.",
