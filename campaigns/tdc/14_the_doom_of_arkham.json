      "text": "The month after your return to Arkham passes like a dream. Something still feels <i>wrong.</i> The concerns of your former life are nothing compared to the austere grandeur and menace of the ancient city. In your dreams, you wander the ancient city, hunted by something you dare not describe. If you were to tell anyone the truth of what you've seen, you could be committed to a sanatorium, or worse. You attempt to track down both Ruby and Andy to ask about their dreams, but can find no trace of them.\nThe Arkham Advertiser has begun to report the spread of an unusual \"sleeping sickness\" in the city's population. There is no known cause, no sign of disease, no common thread to the victims. People seem to simply be falling asleep each night, never to awaken. Rumors abound of sleepwalkers wandering the streets at night. Rather than induce a panic, however, the populace seems to accept what would be alarming news with dull indifference. The city of Arkham is, itself, sinking into a deep slumber.\nIn your restless dreams, you still see the drowned city and the hulking behemoth that once slept within it. You know, beyond a doubt, that you will see him again."
