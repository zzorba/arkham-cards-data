And, well, maybe enough money to pay off my tab at Hibb’s.” He looks bashful. “I had to let off some steam after my last gig! A lot of steam.”\nA tremor rocks the tunnels. Andy’s face grows ashen as he leans in. “I have a theory. This city? It’s rising. I mean, <i>still</i> rising. The shakes, the crumbling foundation, the fact that it was underwater before and now it isn’t. You saw the ship graveyard in the city spires, right? Ships’ve been going missing in this stretch of ocean for centuries. I don’t know what’s causing it, but I keep having these dreams…”\nThe next day, you discover a vast cavern. The walls and ceiling are honeycombed with small round holes that branch off haphazardly into a labyrinthe warren. Andy rushes to the entrance of one particularly foul-smelling tunnel and picks up a bloody scrap of cloth. “I don’t know what lives here, but I think they like eating people.”\nFurther in, fleshy, bilious growths line the tunnel, oozing a thick, phlegmy ichor. Could anyone actually be left alive down here?"

Clawed metal appendages hang over mile-long tracks while gargantuan statues stare down from high alcoves. Rather than walk in the eerie silence, you ask your companions what brought them into Tillinghast’s employ.\n“Truth is, Tillinghast caught me trying to sneak off with some of his, er, stock,” Ruby says. “Not my best work. But that man knows how to spin any deal in his favor. He offered me a job, instead. The money was good⸺better than the stuff I’d nabbed⸺so I said yes. I’ve been saving up for retirement for a while now.”\nThe factories give way to a labyrinthine tunnel system. After days of exploration, you discover a vast cavern. The walls and ceiling are honeycombed with small round holes that branch off haphazardly into a labyrinthine warren. The gory remains of a young man in a patchwork cloak lies prone in front of one tunnel. The stench is unbearable.\n“This is the same kind of cloak the other fella was wearing,” Ruby holds a handkerchief to her mouth as she pulls a small scrap of paper out of the man’s pocket. Scrawled in blood are two words: SEND HELP. You look down the tunnel. Fleshy, bilious growths line the sides, giving it the look of a giant esophagus. A far worse stench emanates from within.\n“Something tells me there’s nobody left to help. Still, there could be something worthwhile down there,” Ruby says, the usual panache noticeably absent from her voice."

We have been instructed by our leader, Lady Dao, to await his return in this ancient city.” The name “Cthulhu” rings in your ears. You have heard it time and again in your dreams.\nMaria continues. “However, there is something malevolent living in these tunnels. Something I fear we awakened by our presence. We sent one of our own to find help, but they haven’t returned.”\nYour discussion is cut short by a dreadful roar. Maria lowers her gaze. “Since we arrived, we’ve been pursued by something… something awful. It hunted us through the streets, the ancient archive, and even through the city’s heart. I hoped it would not follow us to this corrupt and horrible place.” She coughs weakly. “I do not have the strength to lead them out of these tunnels. Please, I beg you, lead us to safety.”\nAnother roar echoes through the tunnels, closer this time, accompanied by the trilling of parasites. Andy looks to you, then to Maria and says, “Gather your people. Nobody deserves to die down here.”"

You see her enter another host, and then another, laying eggs within their gullets. You feel her need to grow, to spread, to proliferate. Then the taste of alien flesh, of human flesh, of your own flesh as Mother tastes you even now.\nYou awaken to see Ruby standing over you, knife in hand. You are in a pulsing, fetid chamber, the cord that linked you to the Mother flails like a lizard’s tail on the ground before you. Embedded in the walls of the chamber is a massive corpse of an alien creature held up like a grisly puppet. Mother herself. You feel her desire to absorb you, to become you, to devour you.\n“We have to kill it,” Ruby growls."
