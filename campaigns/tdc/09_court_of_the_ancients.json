Pressing a panel in its center reveals a vast, airy structure that vaguely resembles the nave of some ancient alien cathedral.

We’re not the first ones here,” says Ruby. The jewel thief is bent over a prone human body lying in a pool of fresh blood. You’re struck by their colorful patchwork cloak.

You press the eye of a particularly disturbing creature and feel a rush of ancient memories. Thoughts and feelings of an alien being, images of the stygian depths of some distant planet, overwhelm your consciousness. The memories give way to clearer, more defined facts, dates, a history recorded by a prehistoric civilization.
