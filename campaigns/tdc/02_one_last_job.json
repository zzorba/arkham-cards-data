The antiquarian's latest shipment from New Orleans has gone missing, and he has tasked you with its recovery. This is just the latest in a string of risky and often illicit \"errands\" for the cunning old man. Tonight's job should pay almost enough to satisfy the rest of your debt to Tillinghast.\nBoth of your informants arrive on time. Ruby Standish, infamous jewel thief, approaches with a knowing smirk. The plucky reporter Andy Van Nortwick comes soon after. Tillinghast seems to draw the most eclectic mix of specialists for his \"favors.\"\nBetween Ruby and Andy's accounts, you piece together a rough idea of the shipment’s location. \"I tracked it from the warehouse in Southside to a few black market dealers in Rivertown. No luck, I'm afraid,\" Ruby says. Andy takes off his hat and wipes his brow \"I nearly bought it in a firefight downtown. Sounds like the Sheldons and O'Bannions are at it again.\"\nThe two gangs are in the midst of another turf war—something about a load of missing hooch. It’s possible the missing shipment was just scooped up with the gangs' actual mark."
