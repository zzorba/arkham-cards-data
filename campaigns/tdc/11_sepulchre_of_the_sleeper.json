Thankfully, the <i>Cassandra</i> is intact. You have barely enough food remaining to make it to the mainland. Andy and Ruby discuss their findings as the rest of the expedition bandage wounds and begin loading the <i>Cassandra</i> for the voyage home. Once the ship is loaded, you join Andy and Ruby on the shore."

The obsidian gates in the base are swung wide open. A faint but sharp smell of decay wafts out of them. \"The crew members who stayed behind say those doors opened a week ago. Someone went inside, but they never returned,\" Andy says. He shares a few translations he made of rubbings from the gate. \"This one describes a glorious rebirth, a risen sleeper, and the return of the great old ones. It claims he will take back what is his: every part of R'lyeh that was stolen, every corner of his domain.\"\n\"This thing—Cthulhu—is dead. Or asleep. I'm not sure; the details are hazy at best. But with the city and everything else in it awakening, I imagine it's only a matter of time until he awakens as well. He's called followers here from their dreams. And judging by the smell, he's in <i>there</i>,\" the reporter points to the obsidian gates.\nAfter a long pause, Ruby stands up.\n\"It wouldn't be much of a heist if we left the doors open,\" she winks.

As you climb aboard the <i>Cassandra</i>, you look back at the blasphemous skyline, outlined against the setting sun like the spine of an ancient beast. The turbid waters churn as the ancient city begins to descend, almost imperceptibly, to be reclaimed by the ocean. Both the dreamer and his house in R'lyeh have been laid to rest.\n\"I wonder what Mr Tillinghast planned to do with those artifacts,\" Andy muses. \"Probably sell 'em\" Ruby says, a cigarette clenched between her teeth.
