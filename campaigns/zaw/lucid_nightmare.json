Your doubts are silenced as the flowers scatter in sight of an English country home, this one much more familiar.  The house is identical to the strange empty one that manifested in Arkham, though it is mirrored from what you remember.  You enter the house with a rush of excitement all the same, though uncertain what you will find inside.  Unlike the barren cottage you explored not so long ago, this house is filled with an uncomfortable clutter, and most of it levitating in random spots.  Finding a passage through the rooms proves more difficult than you expected, but at last you make your way to the strange parlor you briefly viewed through the mirror in Arkham.  A mirror also adorns this mantle, but the reflection is clouded by darkness, so much that you can barely make out your own image on it.  You place a hand on the mirror and press gently, and it bows like a rotted timber.  With few other options, you scale the fireplace and lean forward into the malleable mirror."

Some short distance through the underbrush, your path reaches its terminus at a door embedded in a dirt hillock.  With no reason to hesitate, you open the door and squeeze inside.  The other side doesn't match up with your expectations at all, appearing as a labyrinth of thousands of doors down several branching corridors.  Wearily, you trudge forward, picking a path and proceeding methodically.  Your method soon gives way to madness, however, as the tight corridors open up and the walls seem to fall away from you, as if ejecting from reality altogether.  Gravity turns at random, and you struggle for footing as the long hallways funnel up and down.  As the dread of being forever lost begins to grow, a blinding light beams down at you from a narrow tunnel.  Your footing slips once again, and you begin falling - upward, it seems - toward it.  With scant seconds to brace, you ready yourself for the worst."

From the fading twilight, you can only conclude that you've been gone from Arkham a matter of minutes, in spite of the days and nights you spent in Wonderland.  Your bewildered observation is interrupted by an unearthly noise, one that you know in your soul could only be made by one thing.  You turn toward the south side of the city to gaze at the shadowy form of Gurathnaka."

She, and the rest of Arkham, doesn't recall anything about shadows or the upheaval of reality that you experienced.  By her account, you were discovered last night on the north end of the city and brought to the hospital for treatment.\nDays pass until you are considered fit enough to leave the hospital of your own accord, and in that time, your dreams are plagued by visions of the shadows you fought.  Once cleared, you head directly toward Arkham Asylum and inquire frantically at the front desk about Alice's well-being.  The receptionist shakes his head and gives a resigned sigh.  \"You hadn't heard?  Miss Liddell passed away last week from complications of an epileptic fit.

Its hunger is bottomless, and its minions take after their master in fighting over the scraps of the most decadent feast of all.  Alice is kept alive throughout, and she holds out hope that somewhere, someone in the world can reverse this cataclysm, but in vain.

Your thoughts aren't fully sorted by the time a nurse enters with a small meal for you.  \"You're awake already!  Can you remember the last thing that happened to you?\"  You probe with general questions, trying to figure out just what has happened to Arkham, but the nurse isn't concerned in the least.  The shadows, the brief overlap with Wonderland, and the distorting chaos all fail to get any reaction out of her, other than a suspicious smile.  \"Now it's none of my business, but you really ought to be more careful if you're, erm… drinking anything stronger than water.  Next time, you could end up with more than a few bruises!  Don't worry, your secret is safe here.\"  You attempt to reason with the nurse, but she simply pats you on the hand and insists you eat.  Frustration takes a back seat to practicality, and you accept the food reluctantly, though you still insist that you be given a newspaper as soon as possible.",
