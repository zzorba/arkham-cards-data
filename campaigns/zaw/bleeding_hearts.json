      "text": "Rarely in Wonderland do you see anything uniform or well-ordered, so it strikes you especially strangely when you happen across a grove of trees that have grown inexplicably into heart shapes.  The glade itself is also shaped like a heart, tapering inward toward an especially large tree with a red door embedded in it.  Whoever - or whatever - created this grove may be able to help you in stabilizing Alice's dreams.  You step through the door without delay.\nThe other side of the door might as well have been another world, as it leads to a vast garden surrounding an enormous castle.  The same heart patterns adorn each flowerbed and topiary bush, most decorated in a bright red color.  You have only a moment to consider who would be so fixated on hearts before a platoon of strange figures approach you.  The figures look like playing cards in all four suits, but each with heads, hands and feet.  The fact that they brandish spears at you vindictively takes some of the humor out of their appearance.  You raise your hands to diffuse the situation just as the ranks of the cards part.\nAnother regal figure walks proudly but aggressively toward you.  From her appearance, and connecting the look of the castle around you, it could only be the Queen of Hearts.  She keeps her jaw tightly clenched as she regards you with suspicion.  After a few moments, she begins to speak in a tone that suggests inner rage.  \"And who are you to intrude upon my castle?!\" she accuses gruffly, \"Just the sort of unseemly type to skulk and thieve!\"  You try to smooth things over with the intimidating monarch, but she scoffs openly at you.  \"Don't contradict a queen!  You appear scant moments after my tarts were stolen away, on my unbirthday, no less, and you try to claim coincidence?!  Rubbish and lies!  Off with your head!\"  She storms away, still bellowing for blood, and her entourage of soldiers merely bars your exit.  You wait for a moment in confused silence as nobody attempts to take you away for execution.  Either this is commonplace, or the executioner isn't a real go-getter.\nThe Cheshire Cat appears beside you once more, watching the queen and her soldiers depart.  \"Heady times indeed,\" it purrs, \"and you have the great luck of being here at the crux of it.  The queen does love her tarts so, nearly as much as she loves a good beheading.\"  The cat's head floats away from its body as he speaks to punctuate his statement.  \"They'll have a trial shortly, I should think, but were I you, I wouldn't want my name at the top of any lists.  Blame is the name of the game at the Queen's court, and you would do well to learn it quickly.  But I've every confidence in you.  You've a good head on your shoulders... for now.\"  It vanishes once more with a wide grin, leaving you to figure out how best to save your neck from the headsman's axe."

You scramble back from the door in time to see it ripped from its hinges by a shadowy claw.\nThrough the open portal, you can see that the Queen's castle has devolved into pandemonium as shadowy monsters claw it apart rapidly.  The ornate palace and gardens crumble and scatter as the creatures rampage in their pursuit of victims.  The shrieks and wails of the courtiers and guards are only outmatched by the fierce and violent cries of the Queen of Hearts herself.  She may have been a match for the shadows on her own terms, but as Gurathnaka's minions consume her court and palace, they grow too much even for the bloodthirsty royal to overcome.\nYou continue your escape before you risk death a second time, fleeing back into the surrounding woods before the shadows can overtake you.  The enraged echoes of the Queen's voice reach you long after you lose sight of the glade, but they are finally and suddenly stifled, and a stark stillness falls over the forest.
