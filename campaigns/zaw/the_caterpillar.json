      "text": "There are no established roads through the dense woodlands.  Each trampled trail you find works aimlessly back upon itself to the point where you make better progress forging your own path.  You walk for hour after hour, staving off the strange creatures and trying your best to make sense of the baffling landscape.  Your progress is further hampered as a thick fog creeps over the woods.  You can barely see the distance from one tree to the next, slowing your pace to a staggered walk.  Gradually, you discover an aroma mixed in with the fog, faint but strangely exotic.  The fog slowly transitions to smoke, giving you no further vision, but a clear trail.  You follow the strengthening smell to a secluded copse, covered on every available surface by a hundred varieties of mushroom.\nAtop one of the mushrooms sits a large caterpillar lounging with a hookah beside him.  His eyes rise to meet yours, but he reacts with complete indifference.  \"Who are YOU?\" the Caterpillar demands with smoke streaming from his pursed lips.  You open your mouth to explain, but the insect holds up one of his many arms.  \"Explain once you are the correct size.\"  He breaks off a piece of his toadstool seat and holds it up lazily.  \"This will correct you.\"  You accept with no small amount of consideration, assuring yourself that this is the one case where you would reasonably take mushrooms from a talking caterpillar.  Within moments of taking the bite, you shrink down to a minuscule size.  Satisfied with looking down at you, the Caterpillar takes another long drag of smoke before he continues.  \"The other side will make you grow larger,\" he instructs, breaking off another piece from the opposite side of his mushroom and offering it to you.  \"Now speak.  Who are YOU?\"\nIt's a difficult task explaining the events that brought you here, made all the more uncomfortable by the Caterpillar's apparent lack of interest and attention.  \"Stop,\" he orders at last, drawing upward slightly, \"Where you have been and what you have done are quite different from who you are.\"  You try to tell a bit of your background and motivations instead, but the Caterpillar remains dismissive of your story.  \"You are not the same as you used to be,\" he accuses with a snort, \"Everyone changes, but you have changed far too quickly.  Discover yourself once more.\"  His many hands extend, offering his hookah pipe down toward you.",

      "text": "You take several short puffs of the hookah before your vision blooms with color.  You look to the Caterpillar and find him steadily watching you, perhaps the only anchored figure in the swirling smoke around you.  As the moments pass, you find that the color isn't a figment of your vision at all, but rather a projected light that forms a small mote in the surrounding smoke.  The points of light quickly multiply, shining through the haze in a mosaic pattern.  You look down at yourself to see the colors beaming back onto your body.  Where each light shines, a different facet of yourself manifests.  Courage and conviction intermingled with fear and apprehension.  Talent and ineptitude in equal amounts.  Shadows creep in at the edge of each facet, only to be banished by the overflow from other connecting lights.  The display cascades in front of your eyes with increasing violence, overwhelming your senses and spiking into your mind.  You lose track of the time as moments slip by in dazzling flashes.\nSuddenly, your eyes snap open.  You are lying on the ground, nothing above you but the clouds of smoke, and no sound but the rushing of blood in your ears.  Your muscles slowly relax as your breathing normalizes and the forest ambiance fades back in.  The smoke parts around the stoic face of the Caterpillar, still watching you intently.  He scrutinizes you carefully, then at last gives a satisfied nod and long exhale of smoke.  \"You have found yourself, then,\" he states drolly, returning to his reclining position.  \"When you change now, it will be for the better.\"  You don't know what the Caterpillar expected, but you weren't prepared for this sort of introspective crisis.  Were you still yourself?  Was this all to spark some future change in you?  Or was it preventing a change by making you conscious of it now?  You rise with the intention of pressing the Caterpillar on what he just did to you, but to your surprise he has vanished completely back into the smoke.  You wait tensely, but in vain as even the exotic scent that led you to the Caterpillar fades away.  All you can do now is continue on your search through Wonderland, a little warier if nothing else.",

You scowl in annoyance and prepare to give the Caterpillar a good talking to, but you stop mid-breath.  As the insect bitterly puffs on the hookah, shadows from the surrounding glade begin to collect inside him.  With each inhalation, he grows larger and more alien.  His scowling face grows feral, and he gnaws on the pipe the more it changes.  You take several steps back from the Caterpillar as he draws upward in a predatory stance.\nRemembering the mushroom, you quickly devour the second piece he gave you, growing back to your normal size just ahead of the Caterpillar's own transformation.  The monster does not stop swelling, however, and you flee the smoky glade as trees splinter and fall behind you.  You focus on the mad dash ahead, still unable to see ahead more than a few yards, but spurred onward by the sound of cracking timber and scuttling of a dozen insect legs.  Something lashes out at you, barely missing your side and forcing you to veer off and slide down a mossy slope.  You barely keep your balance and crawl into a hollow log for respite.  Moments stretch to minutes, but the sounds of the mutated Caterpillar have vanished completely into the surrounding haze.  You wait in shaken silence for a few minutes more before finally crawling back out warily.",
