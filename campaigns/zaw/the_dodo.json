In the center of the area stands a glass table with two curious objects on top: a bottle labeled \"DRINK ME,\" and a cake with the words \"EAT ME\" written in its decorations.  You scan the walls for any other way forward, and are shocked to discover an open door, only one that is scarcely knee high and impossible to squeeze through.  With endless wandering as your only alternative, you resolve to find a way through.  Minutes pass without success, and you return to consider the strange refreshments on the glass table.  If this truly is part of Alice's dreams, then there's a chance that they might not be dangerous, and perhaps might even help.  You pop the cork on the bottle and take a wary sip, but the drink's effects quickly flow through you.  At first, it seems like the room is growing larger, but you soon realize that you are shrinking!  You brace for the worst, but find that the effect stops as you reach the right height to easily pass through the tiny door.  At long last, you make your way forward to the sights and sounds of a vast sea.",

Or is Gurathnaka actively warping Wonderland, keeping you from your goal no matter how far you may travel?  Dogged determination pushes you onward even as you question your steps.

A motley pack of animals dashes about, seemingly without direction or destination.  From the center, a Dodo shouts words of action as he runs a short rut in the sand.  \"Yes, that's it!  Up that sandhill there, down the other side!  There's no faster way to get dry!\"\nDry?  The suggestion seems absurd when most of their paths wander into and out of the surf.  You walk over to investigate the bizarre event, and notice the animals are in a sorry state as you approach closer.  Some of the less hardy creatures have collapsed completely, while others don't appear to be breathing whatsoever.  The Dodo urges them onward all the same, seemingly oblivious to their exhaustion, let alone its own.  \"The race must be run… until the race is won… come, you must join us…\"",

The Dodo urges the racers to continue, even as his own body begins to skeletonize.  \"Onward… ever… onwa-\" the Dodo's final urging is cut short as his bones take one final lurch forward and collapse onto the sand.  You stare in bewilderment as the rhythmic sounds of the sea and wind replace the bedlam of the race.  Perhaps Wonderland is just as unstable as Arkham at this point.",

You look out over the surf, and to your astonishment, the tide recedes all at once, leaving behind an arrangement of stones and shells.  The debris portrays a vague map of your current position, with a series of arrows pointing down the beach and then inland.  You breathe a sigh of relief as you make mental notes of the map's layout.  No matter what lunacy may lie ahead, this is Alice's dream at its core.  You don't know what degree of influence she holds over Wonderland in this state, but it's one less burden on your shoulders.",
