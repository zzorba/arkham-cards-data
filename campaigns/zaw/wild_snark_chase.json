      "text": "The forest around you grows darker and more tangled with each step.  It reminds you of the witch-haunted woods on the outskirts of Arkham in several respects.  Each echoing sound might be some eerie creature stalking your steps, or another of Gurathnaka's shadows hungering for your essence.  Your worries escalate as the clear path you'd been following dead-ends in a bramble patch.  You scan the tangle for any sign of a way through or around, but without any promise.  Your eyes return to the path you arrived by, only to find that the forest has swallowed it without any trace.  It's almost as if the woods themselves were actively working to confuse you, like many of Wonderland's other denizens.  Now at a loss for direction, you stumble forward through the rough terrain as long as the fading light allows.  Each passing moment gradually amplifies your fear of being ambushed out from the darkness.  You press on until finally, at the foot of a gnarled tree, you make a campfire from the fallen branches to wait out the night.\nNot an hour into your rest, you are awoken by the clanging of a bell and the clamor of nearby voices.  You rouse yourself from sleep and find that your campfire is somehow missing, though a purring chuckle directs your attention above your head.  The Cheshire Cat holds the burning logs in two paws, waving them like signal lanterns.  Noticing that you've awoken, the cat grins and sets the fire back down before disappearing once more.  A crowd of ten figures rushes eagerly into the clearing around the tree, only to stop with groans and sighs.  \"Tisn't a Snark at all!\" a proud looking man cries, waving his bell for attention.  \"Though Snarks are handy for striking a light, this one's been lit by someone or other.\"  The hunters seat themselves around your fire with several shows of exhaustion.  \"At least it wasn't a Boojum…\" a man with a baker's hat mutters as he wipes the sweat from his brow thankfully.\n\"We'd all have vanished away were that the case!\" the Bellman retorts, seating himself beside you.  He looks you over for a moment as if just noticing you and stands once more.  \"By chance, would you also be hunting a Snark?\"  You shake your head and explain that you've gotten lost in the woods here.  \"What luck, we're lost as well!\" he exclaims with a smile, \"but a Snark's the cure for that!  A Snark is useful for a great many things, and finding one's way surely might be one of them.  You're quite welcome to join our search… pending your profession.\"  You look to the hunters and see a banker, a butcher, a beaver, and others all with jobs beginning with \"b.\"  You think for a moment and tell the Bellman that you could be considered a bodyguard, and he leads his fellows in a cheer.  \"Just what we chiefly need!  We'll find the Snark in no time at all now!  The Tulgey Wood may be dense as a dunce and thicker than thieves, but we'll find the Snark in spite of it!\"",

You start to call for the hunters when you notice a hint of malice in the creature's eyes.  The Bellman didn't mention anything like this about the Snark.  You rapidly rack your brain until you recall a comment about something called a Boojum.  From what the hunters discussed, it's a creature that resembles a Snark, but should you meet it, you will softly and suddenly vanish away.  You look up and realize too late that it's a Boo-",

For minutes at a time, it studies each of the hunters in turn before directing its attention back at you.  The creature is observant, another quality that no doubt helped it stay out of harm's way until recently.

      "text": "Before you can respond or put the Snark to use, the Bellman returns from the discussion with a bottle in one hand and his bell in the other.  He offers you the bell to drink from and sloshes the bottle around as if ringing it.  You politely decline.  \"I'll celebrate your diligence another time, after we've celebrated the catching of the Snark,\" he posits.  You urge the Bellman to save any partying at all for after you've left the increasingly darkening woods.  \"Quite sage,\" the Bellman muses, \"were I not the leader of this venture, you'd make a fine one indeed.  Your duty and honor should now be the first use of Snark!\"  He gathers the hunters around you and the creature, watching expectantly.  You ask the Snark to take you all out of the Tulgey Wood, if it can.  It nods, shrugs, twitches, twirls, and suddenly-\nYou stand at the forest's edge, with the first rays of sunlight beginning to weave through the trees.  The hunters all clap and cheer and call for grog as they marvel at the sudden change.  You look down to the Snark, but the creature has vanished away completely during the transition.  \"Masterful once again!\" the Bellman applauds.  \"We'll save the rest of it for a rainy day - or snowy, should the seasons permit - but in any case, I call an end to the hunting of the Snark!\"  The various hunters all congratulate each other and wander away from the clearing by themselves or in pairs, seemingly unconcerned about the sudden disappearance of the Snark.  Finally, only the Bellman remains standing next to you.  \"Through all the months and weeks of hunting, it never occurred what might proceed the finding of the Snark.  Should you have another expedition in mind, I would gladly pass the days as its leader.\"  Another ally would be welcome as you traverse the rest of Wonderland to save both Arkham and Alice, and so you tell the Bellman just enough about your journey to recruit him without any fuss.",
