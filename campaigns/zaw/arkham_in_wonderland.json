      "text": "You enter the asylum and approach the receptionist, expecting a long and tedious chain of permissions, but are pleasantly surprised to find that Alice can be freely visited.  Ms. Liddell was quite cooperative upon her arrival and was granted a furnished room without restraints.  An orderly escorts you down one of the less unpleasant halls and into Alice's room.  She sits on the edge of the bed with her hands folded, and her head snaps up as you enter, apprehension plastered on her face.  Once you make it clear that you believe her story, however, Alice relaxes visibly, but her worried expression remains.\n\"What you saw was a dream,\" she explains slowly, \"one from my childhood of a strange place called Wonderland.  How innocent it once was…\" her voice trails off and she begins to tremble.  \"When I was younger, I believed it to be a real place.  It all seemed so real to me then, and it was that belief that drew the attention of something dark.  A great and terrible creature that dwells in shadows and feeds on dreams.  But rather than devour Wonderland, the creature strengthened it… no, raised it like cattle.  Fattened it.  Wonderland became more vivid and real than I ever imagined it could be, and it grew beyond my ability to control.  Now, in recent months, my dreams have begun to manifest in the real world.\"\nHer story is utterly fantastical, but you find yourself drawn in even more.  Alice continues with deep terror beginning to surface.  \"The creature is using me to bridge the gap of reality.  It wishes to merge the waking world with Wonderland in order to consume them both.  It began in my hometown in England, where the world began to unravel around me.  I fled, hoping to find a way to escape it, but it follows me no matter where I go.\"  Alice looks to you with exhausted desperation in her eyes.  \"And now that I cannot leave, it is only a matter of time until your own city of Arkham begins to unravel too.  You must find a way to stop this being, for your own sake if not for mine.  Please, you must find a way!\"\nYou reassure Alice to the best of your ability and depart the asylum, wondering how you can even begin this bizarre task.  As you exit, the familiar sight of Arkham's downtown district ripples before your eyes like a band of hot air in the summer, slowly beginning to distort.  Before you can act any further, a grinning mouth appears before you and a striped cat soon blossoms around it.  \"Welcome to Wonderland,\" it suddenly purrs, \"or perhaps you had better welcome Wonderland instead.  The longer you wait, the more of it there is… and the less of you there may be.  Gurathnaka is hungry, and it is very nearly supper time.\"",
