Pale as a sheet, yeh are.\"\nYou turn and face the grizzled old man. Mr. Moore was the only ship captain you could find in Innsmouth who was unafflicted by whatever curse or deformity has gripped most of the town. His apparent humanity, however, has done nothing to spare his broken teeth, crooked jaw, or the massive scar torn down his right cheek. Still, he is a welcome sight, considering the way the rest of your investigation has gone.\n\"Can't believe you want to head to that accurs'd Devil Reef,\" he exclaims, shaking his head. \"It's a fool's errand.\"\nYou point out that the sailor was happy enough to provide passage after you showed him his payment, earning a raspy chuckle out of him.\n\"Yeh got me there,\" he admits. \"Now get ready. We set off in ten.\" He stumbles from the main deck into the bridge to chart a course while you prepare for the journey ahead."

The sailors of Innsmouth speak of silhouettes crawling in and out of caves along the reef's many islands, of strangely misshapen fins sighted along the surface of the sea, and of entire boats crashing against the jagged rocks and vanishing beneath the waves.\n\"All of our research has led to this. Whatever is going on in this town, the Esoteric Order of Dagon and this 'Devil Reef' are at the heart of it. Agent Harper suspects these rumors were spread by the Order to keep sailors away from the reef. If that's true, there must be something the Order is hiding.\"\nYou ask where Harper is, and Dawson shoots you a hard glance. \"She has her mission. We have ours.\" You remind Dawson that you've already accomplished the mission you were hired to perform, which yields a smirk from the hardened vet. \"True. And yet here you are.\"\nHe has a point.

The coves and tidal caverns of Devil Reef were home not just to relics of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, but also to a horde of strange creatures: hybrids between fish, man, and monster. You might have escaped with your life, but the horrors you saw in those caves will stay with you forever.
