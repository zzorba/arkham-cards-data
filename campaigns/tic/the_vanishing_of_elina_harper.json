      "text": "<center><game>WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 17, 1927</game></center>\n<center><game>FIVE WEEKS EARLIER</game></center>\n\"Wake up, dammit!\" Agent Dawson shakes you awake with his right hand. You are in the passenger seat of a pristine, state-of-the-art motorcar, its polished body glowing with light from the moon as it rolls through the foggy Massachusetts countryside. \"We're almost there,\" Dawson informs you. Unfortunately, Innsmouth lacks a working railroad, which you would have preferred. There is a bus that runs from Boston to Newburyport and another that runs from Newburyport to Innsmouth... but Dawson had insisted on driving you there himself, perhaps to provide you an escape route should things go sour, or to show off his expensive automobile. Probably both.\nAs you arrive in Innsmouth, the stale odor of day-old fish and decrepit, musty buildings washes over you. Many of the buildings along the western side of the town seem to be abandoned, though you occasionally spot figures in some of the windows. You imagine Agent Dawson's opulent car must make quite an impression in such a dirty and dingy town. You joke that perhaps he should have driven here in a jalopy, to which he replies with a smirk: \"That's never been my style.\"\nEventually, you reach a defunct railroad station that was given up years ago. A few train cars sit abandoned on the tracks, and the depot is boarded up and condemned. Dawson suddenly grimaces and points to another vehicle in the open lot. \"That's Agent Harper's breezer. Let's park here and continue on foot. We can move through the town a little easier that way,\" he reasons.\nYou check Agent Harper's vehicle before continuing, but it contains no clues as to her whereabouts. From there, you head eastward beside the Manuxet River, passing numerous deserted warehouses, sodden alleyways, and standoffish townsfolk. \"Harper's got to be somewhere in this forsaken town. Residents don't look all too friendly. Wouldn't be surprised if she drew too much attention from a local mob or the like...\" Dawson begins to contemplate aloud. You ask how he knows his agent isn't simply keeping a low profile. \"Ah yes—well, we have a code phrase for that. If she had sent me a letter saying she 'had some errands to run,' that would have signalled that she would be out of touch for a short while. Without that signal, I have to assume the worst.\" To the northeast, several factory buildings loom over the rest of the town's sagging gambrel roofs, cupolas, and widow's walks. None of the locals stop to greet you along your way. Given the repulsive countenance that many of them bear, their aversion to the usual small-town pleasantries is a relief.\nEventually, you reach the town square just south of Manuxet, though even these crumbling brick buildings that surround the supposed heart of the town inspire little confidence in Agent Harper's safety. An old bus idles nearby, its greasy-looking driver leaning against the door and eyeing you suspiciously. With little else to go on, you decide to split up, knowing that you can cover much more ground that way. \"Canvass the locals and learn more about this town,\" Dawson says. \"Find out who the big shots are in this hellhole. One of them is bound to know where Harper was last seen, or who she was with. I'm going to see if I can find where she was hiding out and look for some sign of her. Meet up with me here at 1900 hours. Understood?\" You nod in agreement and go your separate ways.\nThe first person you check with is the bus driver, who probably has a decent understanding of the town. His coarse, greyish skin is the first thing you notice, followed swiftly by unusually deep and shadowed creases in the flesh of his neck, almost as if he were prematurely aged. His bulging eyes are unsettling, and you're suddenly unsure whether you've seen him blink even once as you approach. You start to offer your hand as you introduce yourself, then think better of it, just in case the man has some kind of disease you've never heard of. He introduces himself as Joe Sargent and gives you a useful—if cursory—rundown of some of the nearby buildings."

      "text": "Finally, Mr. Sargent asks you what you're doing in Innsmouth. You dodge the question with one of your own, asking him if he has seen anybody around town matching Agent Harper's description. He pauses, then shakes his head. \"Never seen 'er,\" he mutters, refusing to meet your gaze.\nYou spend the rest of the day learning the layout of the town and attempting in vain to make conversation with the locals. The more time you spend in this strange, squalid town, the more you wish you had never taken Agent Dawson up on his offer. There is something foul in the air here, something rotten and fetid that disturbs you to your core.\nLater that night, you meet up with Agent Dawson in the now-deserted town square and share what you have learned. \"Take a look at this,\" he says, handing you a creased, ink-stained letter addressed to him. \"Turns out Harper had a room at that disgusting old hotel. Still does, technically, but it seemed like she hadn't been around for a few days. I broke in and found this among her things.\"\nJudging from the unmailed letter, it seems Agent Harper knew something in town was tracking her movements. <i>I'm being followed</i>, the missive explains. <i>Don't know how they know, but they know. It's like the whole town is in on something. I have no contacts here whom I trust. I'm going to require more than one agent to sort this out, I fear--</i>\nThe letter is cut short. \"Well, she has more than one agent now,\" Dawson says bitterly once you are done reading. \"There's only one reason she wouldn't have sent this letter. Harper's in danger, and somebody in this balled-up town knows where she is.\" Together, you begin to formulate a plan to find Agent Harper. First, narrow down her last known location. Second, find out who knew she was in town. Then... pay them a visit."

Your heart thumps loudly in your chest as you wait for whatever is to come—a knock on the door, a break-in anything. You certainly aren't expecting a small leather notebook to slip through the crack under your door, though that's exactly what happens.\nAfter a moment, you breathe a sigh of relief and step forward to examine the notebook. It's an old handwritten accound describing the history of the strange town of Innsmouth as far back as the early eighteen hundreds, though the author goes unnamed. The record seems to focus primarily on Obed Marsh's founding of a strange organization called the Esoteric Order of Dagon. You don't remember any manuscripts of this sort on sale at the local bookstore, nor do you think the town has any libraries to speak of. Where was this notebook found, and who delivered it to you?\nCuriosity gets the better of you. You open the door to your hotel room, but the dim, dusty hallway lies bare before you. The identity of your benefactor eludes you. Still, you can't pass up a chance like this. For the remainder of the night, you study the record jotting notes in the margin as you draw connections between Innsmouth's past and the events of the past week. One thing becomes clear: whatever the Esoteric Order of Dagon is, its members must be the ones behind Agent Harper's kidnapping. And just as Agent Dawson suspected, their motives seem to have nothing to do with evading prohibition...",
