All of the evidence has lead you here. Whatever is going on in this town, this Order is behind it. You're sure of it… though their ultimate goal remains a mystery.\nThe town is eerily quiet as you stand before the building's entrance. Once, this place might have been impressive and opulent. Years of disrepair and flood damage have reduced it to a near-ruin. Its once-white paint is gray and peeling, and many of the pillars outside the entryway are beginning to crumble. Still, it is one of the more intimidating places in Innsmouth, projecting authority despite its decrepitude. No, not authority—something darker. A looming, unspoken threat.\n\"Are you ready?\" Agent Dawson asks. His usually calm demeanor has vanished, replaced with a humorless gravity that throws you off guard. \"This is it. This is where we'll find answers.\"\nYou're not so sure. Every other lead you've followed has led to only more questions."

Who sent you here?\" a voice asks. It is deep and husky, like the croaking of a frog.\nYou hear the familiar, cool baritone of Agent Dawson reply: \"Your breath smells awful. Ever heard of brushing your teeth?\" Despite the sarcasm dripping from his words, his voice wavers ever so slightly.\n\"Your mockery only masks the fear that hides within,\" the voice replies. \"Very well. If you are of no use to us, you will be the first to be sacrificed.\"\nYour vision continues to adjust. You can just barely make out Dawson's silhouette on the other side of the cell. He is kneeling before a metal hatch in the stone floor. An elderly robed figure presses a curved knife against Dawson's throat. Someone lifts the hatch, and Dawson's eyes go wide. He gives you one last despairing look, shakes his head slowly and deliberately, and quietly slides something across the stone floor. Then the hooded figure pushes him in. In the scuffle and the low light, nobody notices the car key that skitters to a halt directly next to you.\nYou grab the key and stuff it into your pocket just before you are shoved forward. Two more sets of cold, clammy hands grasp your shoulders, and the hooded figure slides his knife up to your neck. All you can see of his face are his wide, unblinking eyes.\n\"Oceiros, these ones were found in Dagon's lair as well,\" another voice explains to the elderly figure in the robes. \"We believe they were the ones snooping around Devil Reef.\"\nThe man with the knife to your throat nods. \"Your turn,\" he declares. \"Tell us why you have come and perhaps we will let you go. Who sent you? What have you seen?\"",
