The strangest part of it all was that in the wreck of the totalled vehicle, the body of Mr. Carlisle was not found at all. A few days later, a man named Richard Carlisle started appearing again, alive and well. He claims to be the same man, talks the same talk, walks the same walk, and even has the same daredevil attitude that probably got him in that accident to begin with. However, when asked about how he survived it was very strange. His only answer was an odd claim. A claim to have just 'crawled out once he saw a smirk'.",
