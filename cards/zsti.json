When questioned of her identity, the woman claimed to be the missing Princess Anastasia Nikolaevna. After wandering in a deep state of shock for years, Anna said she woke to a phantom song lilting over her nightmares. It was the tainted voice of Grigori Rasputin. In it, she could sense the evil that had taken her brother Alexei from her. “Such drivel!” laughed the nurses in the ward, but with no evidence to the contrary nor any criminal charges to hold her, Anna was released to the world with nothing more than her determination to prove her identity and a book of ravings she believes to be Rasputin's mad poetry. Hungering to stop what had been set in motion, Anna's conviction drives her to pursue every means available to destroy the Mad Monk's demons. But will anyone believe her? Some days, Anna isn't even sure she believes it herself.",
