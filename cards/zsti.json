When questioned of her identity, the woman claimed to be the missing Princess Anastasia Nikolaevna. After wandering in a deep state of shock for years, Anna said she woke to a phantom song lilting over her nightmares. It was the tainted voice of Grigori Rasputin. In it, she could sense the evil that had taken her brother Alexei from her. “Such drivel!” laughed the nurses in the ward, but with no evidence to the contrary nor any criminal charges to hold her, Anna was released to the world with nothing more than her determination to prove her identity and a book of ravings she believes to be Rasputin's mad poetry. Hungering to stop what had been set in motion, Anna's conviction drives her to pursue every means available to destroy the Mad Monk's demons. But will anyone believe her? Some days, Anna isn't even sure she believes it herself.",

Folk in town think of Hosea as “Good People”—the kind who will always have your back in a jam. When rumors began of the mines sheltering bandits, ruffians, and other things, the miners went on strike. Most took other work in Innsmouth or as far out as Dunwich country. Not Hosea. Then, the trusty local returned from the mines with a missing girl from Miskatonic U. A blubbering mess, all she could could utter was “It's... it's unnamable!” Hosea finally had evidence that the dangers weren't just to Black Cave and Arkham, but all the places its dark winding tunnels might lead. And there were other caves. And other towns. Hosea was going to need help.",
