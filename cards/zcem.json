His father was dedicated in body and soul to the protection and salvation of his community, and did not hesitate to act when the cult of Shah-Niggurat was discovered within. Though he attempted to expose them, he paid with his life, and Tarun found his father's mangled corpse at the edge of the nearby jungle. Determined to avenge him, Tarun pursued the cult, using the ways of the Fakir as his guide. He studied the scriptures and trained his body to withstand any sort of pain. Ready at last, Tarun wandered the world, earning his living by performing the Fakir's feats of endurance to fascinated onlookers, but always with his mission of holy vengeance burning in his heart.",
