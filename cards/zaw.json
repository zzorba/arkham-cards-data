This belief attracted the attention of a shadowy being named Gurathnaka who saw opportunity in Alice's dreams.

Alice attempted to outrun the spreading chaos, until her journeys brought her to Arkham, Massachusetts where a group of investigators freed her mind from Gurathnaka's influence. Alice has vowed to repay their deeds by helping to solve as many of Arkham's bizarre happenings as she can.",
