This belief attracted the attention of a shadowy being named Gurathnaka who saw opportunity in Alice's dreams. As Alice grew, it tried to solidify her belief in Wonderland until it began to merge with the real world. Alice attempted to outrun the spreading chaos, until her journeys brought her to Arkham, Massachusetts where a group of investigators freed her mind from Gurathnaka's influence. Alice has vowed to repay their deeds by helping to solve as many of Arkham's bizarre happenings as she can.",
