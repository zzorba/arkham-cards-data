Under \"uses\" in the RR, it's pretty clear that you can't add 'charges' to 'ammo' cards or indeed some other variant. But can you add secrets to a card without uses (x secrets) or indeed any other uses thing? **A:** You can technically add secrets to a card that doesn’t have uses, there is nothing in the rules to prevent you from doing that. Normally this won’t help you at all—if you add a secret to a machete, it won’t do anything for you whatsoever—but there exist cards that use secrets even without the uses keyword, such as the untranslated [Archaic Glyphs](/card/03025) and enraptured will surely combo with them! [adding this ruling from Enraptured here for future reference]",

If I use the [fast] ability on [Ancestral Knowledge](/card/07303) to draw one of the cards attached to it, am I allowed to know what each card is, or is it random? **A:** Unless an effect states otherwise, investigators are allowed to look at the other sides of facedown cards beneath or attached to cards they control, such as [Ancestral Knowledge](/card/07303), [Backpack](/card/04037), and [Diana Stanley](/card/05004). If you are given the ability to draw, play, or interact with one of those cards,\nyou may look at them to know which one you wish to draw or play. This is not true for facedown cards that are attached to encounter cards or placed facedown via a scenario effect, such as swarm cards, empty space, or tomes beneath locations in the challenge scenario Read or Die. In these instances, players cannot look at the other side of those cards unless instructed otherwise. - FAQ, v.1.9, June 2021",

    "text": "- **Q:** There are some basic weaknesses that award XP to the player. According to the order of deck creation, you randomize your basic weakness after deck construction. Is the intention that a player cannot spend this XP until after the first scenario? Or does gaining such a weakness (ie [Offer You Cannot Refuse](/card/53013)) create an opportunity to upgrade before the first setup? **A:** If a weakness you added to your starting deck grants you XP, you can spend that XP right away if you wish.\n\n- **Q:** When I draw the weakness [Offer You Cannot Refuse](/card/53013) with 4 resources in my pool, when dcano I use [Deny Existence](/card/05032)? Before Offer resolves the upgrade of the weakness or afterD If I can play deny, do I still need to upgrade the offer or not? **A:** If you play Deny Existence (either version) as a response to Offer You Cannot Refuse instructing you to lose 5 resources, then the “If you cannot” sentence of Offer’s ability does not apply. The sentence only applies when you have less than 5 resources at the time of resolving the <b>Revelation</b> and no other way to counter or respond to that effect.",
