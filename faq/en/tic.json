The real question is: when does the committed card enter or leave play? Generally speaking, cards placed beneath other cards (such as the card beneath Amanda Sharpe) are out of play. Cards committed to tests never\nreally \"enter play,\" but while they are committed to a test, their icons are added to the investigator’s relevant skill and their text is active. So, while the card beneath Amanda is committed to a test, its icons and text should be alterable by game effects (as if you had committed it from your hand), just like any other in-play card. But as soon as that test ends, it returns to its out-of-play state, and any lasting effects would drop. TL;DR: The bonus icon granted by Grisly Totem would only apply for the\ntest during which Grisly Totem is used, after which the card returns to its out-of-play state, and the bonus icon would drop. - FAQ, v.1.8, October 2020\n\n- **Q:** Can [Defensive Stance](/card/08024), [Survey the Area](/card/08037), [Occult Theory](/card/08065), or [Dauntless Spirit](/card/08078) be committed to tests from beneath [Amanda Sharpe](/card/07002)? **A:** No. A card can only be committed to a skill test if it possesses 1 or more skill icons matching the skill being tested. As these cards only possess skill icons while they are in your hand or already committed to a test, they cannot be committed to a test from anywhere else (such as beneath Amanda Sharpe, or directly from your deck using another card effect). - FAQ, v.2.0, August 2022",

The 'then' rule indicates that the preceding text must resolve in full in order to perform the effect after 'then'. Is Dexter's ability fully resolved, allowing you to draw a card, even if you choose not to return an asset to your hand? The 'may return' makes it sound like there's a chance the ability is fully resolved after having made the choice not to return an asset. **A:** Dexter Drake would need to return an asset to hand before drawing 1 card with his [elder_sign] ability.",

The second aspect of the ability, however, functions like any other ability on a skill card; it may only be used during the resolution of the skill test to which Daring is committed.

In that case, it would depend on the number of action that Silas has performed. **A:** When Carson uses his ability to grant another player an action, he does so during his own turn. The type of icons that Plan of Action would gain in your proposed example depends on how many actions Carson has taken during his turn. (“This turn” = “Carson’s turn.” Though Silas is “taking an action as if it were his turn”, it does not mean he is taking a turn.)",

I assume step 4 like other chaos symbols effects. In this case, how does Sacred Covenant work? [[Skill Test timing](//rules#Skill_Test_Timing)] **A:** Some effects may cause skill test timing to jump around a bit. In particular, whenever an effect causes you to reveal a new chaos token outside of Step 3 (reveal chaos tokens), it resets the timing back down to step 3. For example, if you were to reveal a token with the effect “+2. Reveal another token,” resolving that effect during step 4 would reset the timing back to step 3. (That way you can go through the standard motions of revealing that token and applying its effects and modifier.) The same is true for bless and curse tokens. \nLet’s say you drew 2 bless tokens and a +1 and wanted to use Sacred Covenant to put the unnecessary bless tokens back in the bag. It would go like this: \nSt. 3 — reveal bless token.\nSt. 4 — resolve its effect (reset back to step 3 to draw again).\nSt. 3 — reveal another bless token.\nSt. 4 — resolve its effect.\nSt. 3 — reveal +1.\nAfter St. 3 — trigger Sacred Covenant to put the two bless tokens back in the chaos bag.\nSt. 4+ resolve as normal.\n\n- **Q:** If [Diana Stanley](/card/05004) has <5 cards beneath her, can she use an cancel/ignore effect on a permanent asset such as [Sacred Covenant](/card/07110) to trigger her [reaction] ability to draw a card and gain a resource effectively every turn? **A:** Yeah, it appears so! Diana’s effect doesn’t use the word “then,” so there is no requirement that the card be placed beneath her in order to get the card and resource. And Sacred Covenant surely does ignore a game effect. However, it’s worth noting that one or more [bless] tokens must actually be returned to the bag and ignored in this way in order to trigger Diana’s response. It’s Diana’s blessed day!",

To be more specific:\n - With Old Book of Lore, the investigator searches the top 3 cards of their deck for two total cards, draws them, and shuffles their deck; then, for each card, they can spend one secret to immediately play it at a reduced cost. (They would not have to play both cards.)\n - For Guided by the Unseen, the investigator may search the top 3 cards of their deck for two total cards to commit, then, for each card, they can spend one secret to commit the card.
