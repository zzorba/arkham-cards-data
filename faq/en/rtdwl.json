    "text": "- **Q:** I have a question about effects that \"end your turn\". I'm the last investigator to take a turn during a round; I play [\"Let God sort them out...\"](/card/06160), which immediately ends my turn. Is there a player window after this action and before the end of the investigation phase? (Obviously any such window wouldn't be during my turn any more.) In other words, after playing Let God Sort Them Out with an action in step 2.2.1, does the game sequence continue as normal and return to the previous player window, or does \"immediately end your turn\" skip the sequence ahead to step 2.2.2? If it skips ahead, how would this interact with effects that end your turn at unusual times (e.g. drawing a symbol on [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) during an action taken in the mythos phase with [Quick Thinking](/card/02229)?) **A**: \n - If you were the last investigator to take a turn and played “Let God sort them out…”, your turn would end. Referencing [Appendix II: Timing and Gameplay](rules#Appendix_II_Timing_and_Gameplay), you would resolve step 2.2.2, which checks that everyone has taken a turn, then proceed to step 2.3, the official end of the investigation phase. There are no player windows following the last player’s turn ending; the Enemy Phase begins instead.\n - If you use Quick Thinking during the Mythos Phase and activate Rite of Seeking, the text at the end of Rite of Seeking has no additional effect, because you haven’t “taken a turn” and you don’t have any additional actions to lose. You would simply investigate, determine if you succeed or fail, then continue with the Mythos Phase.",

    "text": "- **Q:** What happens if I miss against an enemy engaged with another investigator, do I deal 0 or 1 damage to the engaged investigator? Other cards like the Shotgun specifies the damage in case of failure, but does that applies to Oops? If I fail by 4 and the enemy is engaged with another investigator and I play Oops (2), how much damage is dealt to the enemy? **A:** So normally, if you fail a skill test while attacking an enemy engaged with another investigator, you’d deal damage to that investigator. Shotgun has a replacement effect for this situation, specifying that the failed attack deals 1 damage for each point failed by to that investigator. If you played Oops! (2) in that situation, you would deal damage to the chosen enemy equal to the amount you failed the test by (up to 3, according to the text on Oops! (2)), and no damage to the other investigator. (Note, if you were attacking an enemy with Shotgun that wasn’t engaged with another investigator and then failed, you wouldn’t deal any damage with Oops! (2).)",
