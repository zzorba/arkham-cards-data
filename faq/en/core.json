What if a <b><i>Spell</i></b> Asset card is played, or an event card (e.g. [Delay the Inevitable](/card/05021)), in which case, at what point has \"the card resolved in full\"? **A:** For Heirloom of Hyperborea, it triggers after you play a <b><i>Spell</i></b> card. If the <b><i>Spell</i></b> card has a single effect like [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) and then gets discarded, you can trigger Heirloom once it’s in the discard pile.

First action, Skids attacks the ghoul (this is the additional action from Leo). Second action, Skids moves location, provoking an attack of opportunity from the ghoul. The investigator places the damage on Leo from the ghoul's attack. Third action, Skids moves again, provoking another attack of opportunity from the ghoul, which kills Leo. Fourth action, Skids plays a second copy of Leo, provoking an attack of opportunity from the ghoul, which the investigator takes on Skids.

If you cast Mind Wipe on an enemy with victory points, and defeat that enemy, it will go into the discard pile, not into your victory display.\n\n- **Q:** Does [Mind Wipe](/card/01068) blank the damage and horror icons of an enemy? **A:** Damage and horror icons are not part of the enemy’s text box, so they are not blanked by Mind Wipe.\n\n- **\"As If\":** This was added to the FAQ (v.1.7, March 2020) and then amended (v.1.8, October 2020). You can read the October ruling on the ArkhamDB rules page [here](/rules#As_If). (I'm adding a hyperlink rather than retyping the rules in case in future the ruling is changed or amended - at that point, the rules page will be updated and all ArkhamDB FAQ entries will link to the correct ruling.)\n\n- **Q:** I was wondering if you could provide an official ruling on how Swarm cards interact with [Mind Wipe](/card/01068). Mind Wipe says to treat the text box of the enemy as if it were blank. Therefore, if an enemy has the text \"hunter\", that would be ignored. For \"swarm\", would this effect discard the swarm cards (on the grounds the host has no text to maintain them) or would it mean the host enemy can now be attacked directly (since it's host cards are no longer considered a swarm textually) or would simply nothing happen because swarms are treated as enemies and thus unaffected? Or perhaps something we have overlooked? **A:** Generally speaking, the rules for the swarming keyword only apply when the enemy enters play. Once it has entered play with the indicated number of swarm cards, the existence of the swarming keyword no longer really matters; all of the rules pertaining to swarm cards apply regardless (kind of like how the “fast” keyword doesn’t matter once the card in question has been played). So, in other words, no, Mind Wipe will not cause swarm cards to suddenly fall off or stop existing, nor would it allow you to attack the host directly. It may however affect other card effects that only refer to enemies with the swarming keyword (such as an effect like “Add 1 swarm card to each enemy with the swarming keyword”).\n\n- **Q:** There's an old ruling that says if you use [Mind Wipe](/card/01068) on [Swamp Leech](/card/81023) and attempt to evade it, the evade value of '-' is treated as 0. If another card, like [Sharpshooter](/card/60327) or [Delilah O'Rourke](/card/06281), references the evade value of something with a '-', like Swamp Leech or [Vulnerable Heart](/card/85043), is it treated as 0 for those purposes as well? Or is the ability just unable to fire? What about investigating the [Hidden Tunnel](/card/08630) in [City of the Elder Things](/card/08621) (for something like [Searching for Izzie](/card/02011), [Call of the Unknown](/card/04009), or [Buried Secrets](/card/08009))? **A:** After re-examining these cards and the direction our game has taken, we are going to override the previous ruling. Even if Swamp Leech were blanked with Mind Wipe, its Evade value would still be a “-“, which can be thought of as “null” or a “non-number.” You could not use this non-number as the basis for a skill test with Sharpshooter. It’s, as you said, unable to fire. This also means that you could not investigate at Hidden Tunnel.",

If you declare you’re going to trigger [Olive McBride's](/card/04197) ability first, you should then declare which of the 3 tokens you’re about to reveal from Olive’s ability will be turned into 2 tokens from the [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) (For example, “I’m going to reveal 3 tokens using Olive, and for the first token, I’m going to reveal 2 instead of 1 using my statue). Then you’ll ignore one of the 2 statue tokens, and be left with 3 total tokens, which you’ll then ignore 1 of. (All of these tokens are considered to be revealed simultaneously, so you are not allowed to reveal the\nfirst 2 tokens with Olive, and then decide whether or not to use the statue). \nIf you instead trigger the statue’s ability first, you would do the same thing, declaring your intent. (For example, “I’m going to reveal 2 tokens using my statue, but for the second token, I’m going to use Olive’s ability to reveal 3 instead of 1”.) Then you would choose between resolving the first token or the 3 Olive tokens. (Here this may seem a little strange, because Grotesque Statue says “Choose 1 of those tokens to resolve, and ignore the other,” which implies that you only get to resolve 1 token and ignore 1 token, but for the purposes of resolving these types of effects, the 3 tokens revealed from Olive’s ability should be treated as 1 revealed token.) If you decide to resolve the 3 Olive tokens you would then choose 2 to resolve and resolve the other, as usual. - FAQ v.1.3, May 2018\n\n- **Q:** Can I trigger [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071)'s ability multiple times in one skill test? **A:** No. Each reaction triggered ability may be triggered only once each time the specified condition on the ability is met, and cannot react to itself. An investigator cannot trigger Grotesque Statue’s reaction ability multiple times for a single test. (September 2023)",

The implication appears to be that only the former are intended to \"count\" for effects that count how many actions have been taken so far in a turn. However, the most commonly played card that counts actions taken, [Pay Day](/card/04233), actually counts how many actions have been \"performed\". Is that simply imprecise templating? Similarly [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) triggers when actions are \"performed\" despite the common understanding that only abilities that cost actions in the first place can be taxed by FiF. Finally, and in the same vein, bold action designators on free triggered abilities or reactions also \"perform\" actions. Am I correct that they are not intended to be taxed by FiF or count towards Pay Day? **A:** Frozen in Fear requires 1 additional action to be spent when performing basic actions, granted actions, or Free Triggered Ability actions of the specified types. We have decided on the following clarifications for Pay Day:\n\n - Pay Day will grant 1 resource for each basic action taken, any effect that states “perform an X action”, any effect that states “take an X action”, and Free Triggered Abilities with a bold action trigger.\n - Pay Day will NOT grant resources for Fast cards played or “action triggered abilities” that require multiple player actions to be spent on a single action performed (ex. the second ability on [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) that only counts as one Fight action).\n\n\n- **Follow-up Q:** To be completely clear, does Frozen in Fear make the move granted from [Shortcut](/card/03232) cost an action or not? **A:** Yes, the move on Shortcut (2) would then cost an action.",

    "text": "- **Q:** I'm considering a [Mandy Thompson](/card/06002) deck, and I wondered about her reaction ability and cards like [Old Book of Lore](/card/01686) and [Guided by the Unseen](/card/07223), where the find has a cost. Do you pay the cost to activate the card you find once (effectively replacing \"Pay XX to ... that card\" with \"Pay XX to ... those cards\")? Or do you have to pay the cost for each instance, \"Pay XX to ... that card\" becoming \"Pay XX for each card that you want to ...\"? **A:** Mandy’s ability to “resolve 1 additional target of the search” can be thought of as treating the additional target just like the original target. To be more specific:\n - With Old Book of Lore, the investigator searches the top 3 cards of their deck for two total cards, draws them, and shuffles their deck; then, for each card, they can spend one secret to immediately play it at a reduced cost. (They would not have to play both cards.)\n - For Guided by the Unseen, the investigator may search the top 3 cards of their deck for two total cards to commit, then, for each card, they can spend one secret to commit the card. (They would not have to commit both.)\n\n- **Q:** [Knowledge is Power](/card/05231) reads: \"Resolve an [action] or [fast] on that asset, ignoring all costs.\" [Old Book of Lore](/card/06279) reads: \" ... may spend 1 secret to have that investigator immediately play that card\". If I use Knowledge is Power on Old Book of Lore, do I need to spend a secret to use the \"immediately play that card\" part of the ability? Clearly Knowledge is Power does not allow me to ignore any costs of the card I'm about to play (c.f. ruling on [De Vermis Mysteriis](/card/05235)), but does the \"may X to Y\" templating here mean spending a secret here a cost? **A:** Knowledge is Power allows you to ignore ability costs on the chosen asset, which includes costs printed in its text box; this means you are able to immediately play the card you fetched with Old Book of Lore without spending 1 secret.",

Is there a player window after this action and before the end of the investigation phase? (Obviously any such window wouldn't be during my turn any more.) In other words, after playing Let God Sort Them Out with an action in step 2.2.1, does the game sequence continue as normal and return to the previous player window, or does \"immediately end your turn\" skip the sequence ahead to step 2.2.2? If it skips ahead, how would this interact with effects that end your turn at unusual times (e.g. drawing a symbol on [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) during an action taken in the mythos phase with [Quick Thinking](/card/02229)?) **A**: \n - If you were the last investigator to take a turn and played “Let God sort them out…”, your turn would end. Referencing [Appendix II: Timing and Gameplay](rules#Appendix_II_Timing_and_Gameplay), you would resolve step 2.2.2, which checks that everyone has taken a turn, then proceed to step 2.3, the official end of the investigation phase.
