However, there is no timing point of engagement, you’re just “considered” engaged with it, so you can’t really trigger reactions to becoming engaged with the enemy, like [Zoey Samaras](/card/02001) or [Zoey's Cross](/card/02006).\n\n- **Q:** If a swarming enemy engages Zoey Samaras, can she trigger her  [reaction] ability once for each enemy in total, or only once for the entire swarm? **A:** Although swarming enemies move and engage together as a single entity, each swarm card is its own separate enemy. If a swarming enemy engages Zoey, each of its swarm cards are also enemies that have engaged Zoey. Therefore, she may trigger her [reaction] ability once for each of them. - FAQ, v.1.9, June 2021",

(I know you can't when you reveal multiple tokens simultaneously (say through [Olive McBride](/card/04197)) but I'm less certain here.) **A:** You sure can! Actually, you can even when revealing multiple tokens with Olive as well, as long as they aren’t being ignored/canceled. For example, if with Olive you revealed a [skull], a [tablet] and an [elder_thing], and then ignored the [elder_thing], you could still trigger Ritual Candles twice—once for the [skull], and once for the [tablet]. \n\n- **Q:** [<i>part 2, following on from previous Q&A</i>] I thought you can't with Olive because of this rule on [reaction] triggered abilities: \"Each [reaction] triggered ability may be triggered only once each time the specified condition on the ability is met. For example, an ability that is triggered \"After X occurs,\" may be used once each time \"X\" occurs. Additionally the FAQ entry [Resolving Multiple Revealed Chaos Tokens](/rules#Resolving_Multiple_Revealed_Chaos_Tokens): \"[...] when resolving multiple chaos tokens, any game or card effects which trigger if a certain chaos token is revealed—such as the text “If the named chaos token is revealed during this skill test…” on [Recall the Future](/card/04158)—will trigger if any of the resolved chaos tokens meet the specified conditions. Such an effect will not trigger twice if two of the designated tokens are resolved.\" **A:** [<i>part 2</i>] Each [reaction] ability can be triggered once each time the specified condition is met. In this case the condition is “after a (symbol) token is revealed during a skill test.” Therefore, if two symbols are revealed during a skill test, the reaction may be triggered twice. (This would be different if it read “1 or more tokens.”) As for the second ruling [the FAQ], that doesn’t apply here. That ruling is specifically talking about effects within another ability that trigger if a chaos token is revealed, such as the horror-dealing effect on [Shrivelling](/card/01060). Those are not independent reaction triggers, they are delayed effects that trigger if a particular type of chaos token is revealed (in other words, they are a binary state; they either trigger or they don’t).",

The ability to retire from and/or join an in-progress campaign exists to give players more freedom when playing through a campaign with friends.

Sometimes players cannot make it to a play session, and sometimes you'd like to include a friend mid-campaign without having to start over.

If this occurs, depending on the timing of such an effect, certain steps of the skill test may be skipped in their entirety.\n  - If it is known that an investigator automatically succeeds or fails at a skill test before Step 3 (“[Reveal Chaos Token](/rules#Skill_Test_Timing)”) occurs, that step is skipped, along with Step 4. No chaos token(s) are revealed from the chaos bag, and the investigator immediately moves to Step 5. All other steps of the skill test resolve as normal.\n  - If a chaos token effect causes an investigator to automatically succeed or fail at a skill test, continue with Steps 3 and 4, as normal.\n  - If an ability “automatically evades” 1 or more enemies, this is not the same as automatically succeeding at an evasion attempt. As per the entry on “[Evade](/rules#Evade_Action)” in the Rules Reference, if an ability automatically evades 1 or more enemies, no skill test is made for the evasion attempt whatsoever. Consequentially, because no skill test is made, it is not considered a “successful” evasion. The investigator simply follows the steps for evading an enemy (exhausting it and breaking\nits engagement).\n  - For example: Patrice uses the ability on [Hope](/card/06031), which reads: “[action] If Hope is ready, exhaust or discard him: Evade. Attempt to evade with a base [agility] value of 5. (If you discarded Hope, this test is automatically successful.)” If Patrice chooses to discard Hope, the skill test automatically succeeds before chaos tokens are revealed; therefore Steps 3 and 4 of the skill test are skipped. However, the skill test still takes place. Cards may still be committed to the test, and the investigator’s total modified skill value is still determined, as it may have some bearing on other card abilities. However, if Patrice instead uses the ability on [Stray Cat](/card/01076), which reads: “[free] Discard Stray Cat: Automatically evade a non-<b><i>Elite</i></b> enemy at your location,” no skill test is made whatsoever. - FAQ, v.1.7, March 2020",

Specifically are there any skill effects not cancelled by these effects? My primary confusion results from cards like [On the Mend](/card/09006). If On The Mend's **Forced** effect is also cancelled is it discarded instead of being returned to Vincent's set aside area? If so and Vincent shuffles his discard into his deck how should the Limit 1 in hand be resolved if he attempts to draw a copy of On the Mend when one is already there? Similarly for things like [Unrelenting](/card/07196), is the text that returns the sealed tokens at test end canceled? Does it matter because the default rules for seal would resolve at that time? **A:** We reviewed the scenario cards in question and we will plan to address them in the next FAQ, either with errata or with additional clarification. We believe that, when a scenario card such as Where Doom Awaits states to “cancel the effects and icons” of committed skill cards, this only applies to non-weakness skill cards and only lasts until Step 7 of that skill test. This should clarify our intentions for such a scenario. This should allow for On the Mend to be returned to hand as intended instead of discarded, and for Weakness skill cards such as [Dreams of the Deep](/card/98015) to function as intended. As for Unrelenting, there is already a rule in place that if a card with sealed tokens leaves play, those tokens are immediately released, so the tokens would still be returned even if the card’s effects were canceled during the test.",

Generally, investigators have 3 actions to take whenever they take a turn, and each investigator takes one turn during the investigation phase. If a card effect grants you a new turn, either explicitly or in this case by allowing you to repeat the investigation phase, the investigators should be granted a full turn’s worth of actions once again.
