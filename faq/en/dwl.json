(I know you can't when you reveal multiple tokens simultaneously (say through [Olive McBride](/card/04197)) but I'm less certain here.) **A:** You sure can! Actually, you can even when revealing multiple tokens with Olive as well, as long as they aren’t being ignored/canceled. For example, if with Olive you revealed a [skull], a [tablet] and an [elder_thing], and then ignored the [elder_thing], you could still trigger Ritual Candles twice—once for the [skull], and once for the [tablet]. \n\n- **Q:** [<i>part 2, following on from previous Q&A</i>] I thought you can't with Olive because of this rule on [reaction] triggered abilities: \"Each [reaction] triggered ability may be triggered only once each time the specified condition on the ability is met. For example, an ability that is triggered \"After X occurs,\" may be used once each time \"X\" occurs. Additionally the FAQ entry [Resolving Multiple Revealed Chaos Tokens](/rules#Resolving_Multiple_Revealed_Chaos_Tokens): \"[...] when resolving multiple chaos tokens, any game or card effects which trigger if a certain chaos token is revealed—such as the text “If the named chaos token is revealed during this skill test…” on [Recall the Future](/card/04158)—will trigger if any of the resolved chaos tokens meet the specified conditions. Such an effect will not trigger twice if two of the designated tokens are resolved.\" **A:** [<i>part 2</i>] Each [reaction] ability can be triggered once each time the specified condition is met. In this case the condition is “after a (symbol) token is revealed during a skill test.” Therefore, if two symbols are revealed during a skill test, the reaction may be triggered twice. (This would be different if it read “1 or more tokens.”) As for the second ruling [the FAQ], that doesn’t apply here. That ruling is specifically talking about effects within another ability that trigger if a chaos token is revealed, such as the horror-dealing effect on [Shrivelling](/card/01060). Those are not independent reaction triggers, they are delayed effects that trigger if a particular type of chaos token is revealed (in other words, they are a binary state; they either trigger or they don’t).",

As per the entry on “[Evade](/rules#Evade_Action)” in the Rules Reference, if an ability automatically evades 1 or more enemies, no skill test is made for the evasion attempt whatsoever. Consequentially, because no skill test is made, it is not considered a “successful” evasion. The investigator simply follows the steps for evading an enemy (exhausting it and breaking\nits engagement).\n  - For example: Patrice uses the ability on [Hope](/card/06031), which reads: “[action] If Hope is ready, exhaust or discard him: Evade. Attempt to evade with a base [agility] value of 5. (If you discarded Hope, this test is automatically successful.)” If Patrice chooses to discard Hope, the skill test automatically succeeds before chaos tokens are revealed; therefore Steps 3 and 4 of the skill test are skipped. However, the skill test still takes place. Cards may still be committed to the test, and the investigator’s total modified skill value is still determined, as it may have some bearing on other card abilities. However, if Patrice instead uses the ability on [Stray Cat](/card/01076), which reads: “[free] Discard Stray Cat: Automatically evade a non-<b><i>Elite</i></b> enemy at your location,” no skill test is made whatsoever. - FAQ, v.1.7, March 2020",

That means that all tokens and attached cards will remain when they are flipped over. Technically this does allow you to tell which location is which when they are ‘shuffled’, whether that's because doom is in play due to [Destroyed Path](/card/02287) or if an [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168) is in play, but for an added challenge and mystery (and for the sake of simplicity), players can place those tokens or attachments onto a random location after they are shuffled, so that they don’t know which location is which.",

    "text": "- Generally speaking, investigating is the act of investigating a location. Thematically, [Deciphered Reality](/card/02303) makes it seem like you are investigating all of the revealed locations at once, and that is surely the flavor of the card. But examining the text of the card line by line, we see that it only really does 2 things: 1) Instead of the test’s difficulty being equal to the shroud value of your location, the test’s difficulty is equal to the highest shroud value among revealed locations in play. 2) If you succeed, you discover 1 clue from each revealed location in play (and this is not a replacement effect). You’re still technically investigating your location. For example, if you played Deciphered Reality while in the [Orne Library](/card/02050), you would still need to spend an additional action to investigate. Likewise, you couldn’t play Deciphered Reality at a location with a [Locked Door](/card/01174).\n\n- [Deciphered Reality](/card/02303) is not a replacement effect; its effect doesn’t use any form of ‘instead’ or ‘but,’ so its effect is in addition to the standard rewards for successfully investigating. (Otherwise it would say something like “instead of discovering a clue at your location…”) (Compare with [Burglary](/card/01045)). In other words, if you successfully use Deciphered Reality, you would discover 1 clue at your location, and 1 clue at each revealed location. If you commit [Deduction](/card/01039) to this test, you would still discover 1 additional clue at your location.",

    "text": "- When a phase is skipped, it is skipped in its entirety. Reactions to that phase beginning or ending cannot be triggered, because the phase does not ever begin or end. So if you use [The Gold Pocket Watch](/card/02305) to skip the Mythos phase with [The Red-Gloved Man](/card/02310) in play, [The Red-Gloved Man](/card/02310) is not discarded from play, because his Forced effect never triggers.\n\n- **Erratum:** The [fast] triggers on [The Gold Pocket Watch](/card/02305) should be [reaction] triggers - FAQ v1.2, Jan 2018.\n\n- **Q:** If I use the [The Gold Pocket Watch](/card/02305) to repeat the investigation phase, do I get 3 more actions, given actions reset in the upkeep phase? **A:** The \"reset actions\" step of the upkeep phase and the mini-cards are mostly there as a convenience in order to give players a way of tracking who has taken a turn and who has not. Generally, investigators have 3 actions to take whenever they take a turn, and each investigator takes one turn during the investigation phase. If a card effect grants you a new turn, either explicitly or in this case by allowing you to repeat the investigation phase, the investigators should be granted a full turn’s worth of actions once again. Likewise, if the upkeep phase is skipped, this doesn’t prevent the players from being able to take their turn during the next round.\n\n- **Q:** When one player uses [Guidance](/card/03265) to give a second player an additional action during their turn this round and a player uses [The Gold Pocket Watch](/card/02305) to repeat the investigator phase, does the second player get an additional action in the repeated investigator phase, or does Guidance only apply to a single phase? **A:** Generally speaking, effects that affect a player’s turn or last until the end of a player’s turn expire at the end of that turn, so even if you are able to repeat the phase or gain an additional turn, the effect on Guidance would have already expired by then.",
