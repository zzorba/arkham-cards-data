Are cards put beneath these investigators by their abilities considered to be in play, or out of play? The question arises because they're physically in an investigator's play area, which suggests they might be in play, but there are a few implications that makes me want to confirm. For example, if they are in play, that implies that a treachery such as [Ants!](/card/04221) can discard them, which feels strange. Can you confirm if those cards are in play or not? **A:** These cards are considered out of play. They cannot be affected by anything other than the abilities that refer to them explicitly (like Sefina's action ability, [Twilight Blade](/card/05013), etc).",

That includes The Painted World being treated as a copy of another card; as soon as The Painted World leaves play, it ceases to be a copy and goes back to just being The Painted World. Since the victory display is an out of play area, you could play The Painted World as a copy of Delve Too Deep, but as soon as it got added to the victory display it would cease to be a copy of Delve Too Deep and would go back to being The Painted World, thus losing its victory points.\n\n- [The Painted World](/card/03012) vs Fast cards (such as [Elusive](/card/01050) or [Ward of Protection](/card/01065)): The Painted World is \"played as a copy” of an event, which means if that event is fast, The Painted World will also be fast, and if that event has a play restriction or trigger (like “Play after blah blah blah”), The Painted World would also have that same restriction or trigger if played as a copy of that event.\n\n- **Q:** Can you use [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033) on [The Painted World](/card/03012) when it's copying a non-<b><i>Spell</i></b>-traited card under [Sef](/card/03003)? **A:** You can use Uncage the Soul to play The Painted World from your hand (regardless of whether or not the card you are copying has the <b><i>Spell</b></i> trait). Uncage the Soul allows you to play a <b><i>Spell</i></b> or <b><i>Ritual</i></b> card from your hand, reducing its resource cost by 3. Since The Painted World is still a <b><i>Spell</i></b> at the time you are choosing a card to play using Uncage the Soul, you can choose The Painted World as its target. Then, as soon as you begin the sequence of actually playing the card (including checking play restrictions and determining the card’s cost) The Painted World becomes a copy of whatever card you are choosing to play it as (in this case, [Hot Streak](/card/01057) or [Backstab](/card/01051) or whatever other card you want to copy).\n\n- **Q:** How does [The Painted World](/card/03012) interact with [Crystallizer of Dreams](/card/06024), as they both replace the discard effect? **A:** \"Both effects are replacement effects, and since The Painted World’s replacement effect is forced and Crystallizer of Dreams is optional, the forced effect would take priority and resolves first. Therefore The Painted World must be removed from the game after it is played and cannot be placed underneath Crystallizer of Dreams.\"\n\n- **Q:** [Double, Double](/card/05320) vs [The Painted World](/card/03012). <s>I imagine The Painted World cannot be played twice by Double, Double, since it's removed from the game, but can the copied event be played twice? **A:** You can absolutely use Double, Double to play The Painted World twice. Note that it says you play it “as if it were in your hand,” so each time you played it in this way, you could choose a different event beneath Sefina Rousseau. Keep in mind this may not work with some events (such as events that become attachments or go to a specific play area) as you only actually have one physical copy of The Painted World to move around.</s> **UPDATE:** There is an extant ruling that one can trigger [Double, Double](/card/05320) after playing [The Painted World](/card/03012) (and target different cards no less). A recent ruling said that one cannot trigger double double after playing [Cheat Death](/card/03310) as Cheat Death will have been removed from the game as part of its resolution. As The Painted World is also removed from the game during its resolution (albeit with slightly different timing) is this ruling no longer valid? Would the same be true of any card removed from the game? **A:** Under current rulings, removing The Painted World from the game is a part of its resolution, so it would be an ineligible target for Double, Double. This does overrule the previous ruling.",

Even if it has no valid path to an investigator, an enemy can still qualify as the \"nearest\" enemy if there are no other enemies in play that are nearer. It might help to think of it this way: an enemy at a location with no valid path to your location is – in essence – an infinite number of locations away. If there were any other enemy anywhere, even if it were 100 locations away, that would be nearer. But if there were no other enemies in play, then that enemy an infinite number of locations away would still be the nearest. That said, effects that require an enemy to track a path to an investigator (such as [Dance of the Yellow King](/card/03097), for example) would fail in this circumstance, because the enemy cannot possibly track a path to you, even if they are the \"nearest\" enemy.",

    "text": "- **Q:** How does [Snare Trap](/card/03199) interact with abilities that trigger upon an enemy becoming engaged when the enemy is spawned at the location with the Snare Trap? Since enemies spawn engaged with the investigator who drew them (unless they have a different Spawn) does this trigger before the Snare Trap? For example, would a [Maniac](/card/03095) deal damage to himself and the investigator before the Snare Trap exhaust and disengages him? **A:** This question actually leads to a Nested Sequence, so in order to fully understand my answer it may help to take a look at rule 1.4 in the FAQ, “[Nested Sequences](/rules#Nested_Sequences).”\n\n Each time a triggering condition occurs, the following sequence is followed: (1) execute “when...” effects that interrupt that triggering condition, (2) resolve the triggering condition, and then, (3) execute “after...” effects in response to that triggering condition… It is possible that a nested sequence generates further triggering conditions (and hence more nested sequences). There is no limit to the number of nested sequences that may occur, but each nested sequence must complete before returning to the sequence that spawned it. In effect, these sequences are resolved in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.\n\n Now let’s take a look at the cards. Snare Trap says “**Forced** - After a non-Elite enemy enters attached location: Exhaust that enemy, disengage it from all investigators, and attach Snare Trap to it.” This is a forced ability that triggers after the enemy enters the attached location. However, any time a ready unengaged enemy is at the same location as an investigator, it engages that investigator (\"[Enemy Engagement](/rules#Enemy_Engagement),\" RR page 10). This is a constant effect that the game is always checking and therefore has timing priority over Forced abilities. As a result, the enemy would enter your location and immediately engage you before you could trigger any “after” effects in response to the enemy entering your location. Then, since engaging you is a triggering condition for another ability, this begins a nested sequence. You must execute any abilities that respond to the enemy engaging you before you can return to the original triggering condition (the enemy entering your location). So then you would execute the Maniac’s **Forced** effect (as well as any other **Forced** effects in response to Maniac engaging you). Finally, you would return to the original triggering condition and respond to the enemy entering your location, triggering the Forced ability on Snare Trap. So, to sum up:\n\n 1) Maniac enters your location.\n\n 2) Maniac immediately engages you. This is a constant ability, so it has timing priority over “after” effects that respond to the enemy entering your location.\n\n 3) Execute abilities that respond to enemy engagement (such as Maniac’s ability) \n\n 4) Return to original triggering condition and execute abilities that respond to the Maniac entering your location (such as Snare Trap’s ability).\n\n That’s a nested sequence for you! It would be even more complicated if you had abilities that responded to taking damage! (Those abilities would trigger in between steps 3 and 4, for the record.)\n\n- **Q:** Can you please illustrate how [Snare Trap](/card/03199) interacts with an investigator failing the test for [Dance of the Yellow King](/card/03097)? Two scenarios: a) A Lunatic enemy has the Snare Trap attached when Dance of the Yellow King affects them; b) a Lunatic enemy trips a Snare Trap on the way to the target investigator. Thanks for your help! **A:** Great question. Let’s look at the text of Dance of the Yellow King for a moment: “**Revelation** - If there are no Lunatic enemies in play, Dance of the Yellow King gains surge. Otherwise, test [willpower] (3). If you fail, the nearest Lunatic enemy readies, moves (one location at a time) until it reaches your location, engages you, and makes an immediate attack.” \n\n This effect forces an enemy to do 4 effects (ready, move, engage, and attack). Generally speaking, effects that are listed with the word “and” are not dependent on one another (for example, if an effect said “draw 1 card and gain 1 resource” I could still gain 1 resource even if I could not draw cards). However, in this case, some of these effects are dependent on one another simply by virtue of what they are. For example, if an enemy that is not at your location cannot move, it also cannot engage you, because engaging you would cause it to move to your location. Likewise, if an enemy was not engaged with an investigator, “make an attack” would not do anything, because the game has no way of knowing who the enemy attacks. (Note that this would be different had the card read “makes an immediate attack against you.”) That being said, neither movement nor attacks are dependent on the enemy being ready – enemies don’t normally move from the hunter keyword while exhausted or attack during the enemy phase while exhausted, but exhausted enemies can still move or attack from on card effects.\n \n So, here’s what would happen in this circumstance: If a Lunatic has Snare Trap attached when you draw Dance of the Yellow King, it would not ready because it would instead discard the Snare Trap, but it would still move towards you, engage and attack, because these effects are not dependent on the enemy remaining ready. If a Lunatic is moving toward you from Dance of the Yellow King and enters a location with a Snare Trap, it would immediately exhaust, disengage, and have Snare Trap attached to it… But then it would continue moving towards you, engage you, and attack.\n\n Man, Lunatics are pretty relentless when being manipulated by Him Who Is Not To Be Named, aren’t they?",

The implication appears to be that only the former are intended to \"count\" for effects that count how many actions have been taken so far in a turn. However, the most commonly played card that counts actions taken, [Pay Day](/card/04233), actually counts how many actions have been \"performed\". Is that simply imprecise templating? Similarly [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) triggers when actions are \"performed\" despite the common understanding that only abilities that cost actions in the first place can be taxed by FiF. Finally, and in the same vein, bold action designators on free triggered abilities or reactions also \"perform\" actions. Am I correct that they are not intended to be taxed by FiF or count towards Pay Day? **A:** Frozen in Fear requires 1 additional action to be spent when performing basic actions, granted actions, or Free Triggered Ability actions of the specified types. We have decided on the following clarifications for Pay Day:\n\n - Pay Day will grant 1 resource for each basic action taken, any effect that states “perform an X action”, any effect that states “take an X action”, and Free Triggered Abilities with a bold action trigger.\n - Pay Day will NOT grant resources for Fast cards played or “action triggered abilities” that require multiple player actions to be spent on a single action performed (ex. the second ability on [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) that only counts as one Fight action).\n\n\n- **Follow-up Q:** To be completely clear, does Frozen in Fear make the move granted from [Shortcut](/card/03232) cost an action or not? **A:** Yes, the move on Shortcut (2) would then cost an action.",

For example, can Lola Hayes use Eidetic Memory to play [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) ([rogue])? **A:** Unfortunately, Lola could not use Eidetic Memory to play a card from a class other than [seeker]. She must be in the [seeker] role in order to play Eidetic Memory, but she must also be in the corresponding role for the chosen insight event, since she is playing Eidetic Memory as an exact copy of that card (including its class). As a result, the chosen insight event must either be Seeker or neutral in order for Lola to play Eidetic Memory as a copy of it.\n\n- **Q:** Can Eidetic Memory be used to copy signature events with the Insight trait? For example, could Lola copy Roland's [Mysteries Remain](/card/98005) (if it was in his discard pile)? We noticed the current FAQ only references control: \"An investigator cannot control another investigator’s signature cards.\" **A:** Yes, although it’s worth noting that Mysteries Remain removes itself from the game when played, so it will only end up in the discard pile if it is discarded through some other means.\n\n- **Q:** Can I play a card with a cost of “–”? **A:** No. Cards with a cost of “–” have no cost that can be paid, and therefore cannot be played.

(Cards that put it directly into play bypassing its cost would be able to put it into play, however.) Cards with a cost of “–” that are played as a copy of a different card, such as [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306), use the resource cost of the copied card, and therefore bypass this restriction. - FAQ, v.1.8, October 2020",

Since each of them would be put into play at the same time, the investigators would decide which one is put into play first (with the lead investigator breaking any conflicts). The other copies of Charon’s Obol would not be put into play, nor would they be shuffled into their owner’s deck (as per the rules for the Permanent keyword). Only the investigator with Charon’s Obol in play would receive its benefits (or its consequences, for that matter).\n\n- **Q:** If I purchase a permanent card for my deck, like [Charon's Obol](/card/03308), can I later remove it from my deck? **A:** Not unless an effect explicitly allows you to do so. Generally cards are only removed from your deck if you purchase a new card and must swap out an existing card in order to reach your investigator’s deck size. However, since Permanent cards do not count towards your deck size, they cannot be swapped out in this way.

    "text": "- **NB:** ArkhamDB now incorporates errata from the Arkham Horror FAQ in its card text, so the ArkhamDB text and the card image above differ, as the ArkhamDB text has been edited to contain this erratum (updated January 2022): **Erratum:** The second part of this card’s ability should read: “Undo that action *(return the game state to exactly the way it was before that action was performed, except for the playing of Time Warp and its costs)*.” - FAQ, v.1.4, September 2018\n\nThis card will prompt a lot of crazy rules questions. Here are some answers. The headline, though: \n\n\"The fact of the matter is that 99% of the time, this card is going to be used in quite simple situations, like after failing an attack against a retaliate enemy ... *The only really important thing to remember is if you can’t return the game state to the way it was before you played Time Warp, the effect fails (i.e. you can’t pick and choose which things to reset, it’s all or nothing).*\" [emphasis Frank's]\n\n- **Q:** What happens if the action that's being undone has (as per special symbols in [Rite of Seeking](/card/02028)) immediately ended the investigator's turn?  **A:** Even if the action you were performing ended your turn, you can still play [Time Warp](/card/03311) as a reaction to that action resolving. Time Warp doesn’t say \"play only during your turn\" nor does it take an action to play, so there’s no reason why you couldn’t play it even if your turn ended. In playing it, you would return the game state to the way it was before your turn \"immediately ended\"”, so you could then continue to play out your turn, as normal. \n\n- **Q:** Can you play [Time Warp](/card/03311) after an action ends the game? **A:** Note that you could not play Time Warp in reaction to an action that ended the game, because ending the game is immediate, and no more cards can be played once the game has ended.\n\n- **Q:** When returning the game state to 'exactly the way it was before that action was performed':  if I use [Scrying](/card/01061), and then play Time Warp, do I put back the scryed cards in the order I saw them? More generally, how does this card interact with scrying? What happens if the action I've performed, like [Calling in Favors](/card/03158), has shuffled my deck? **A:** To the extent that cards can be returned in the same order, they should be. So for example, if you use Scrying to reorder the top 3 cards of the encounter deck and then play Time Warp, you should go back and reorder those cards into their original order. Likewise, if I drew a card and then played Time Warp, the card I drew should be returned to the top of my deck. If you are unable to return the game state to exactly the way it was before the action was performed, the effect fails.To the extent that you know the exact order of things, you should return the game state to exactly the way it was. But for cards whose order you did not know, it’s fine to keep them randomized. For example, if I played No Stone Unturned and searched my deck for any card (let’s say Encyclopedia), it was part of my unknown randomized deck, so if somebody then plays Time Warp, I can (and should) just shuffle Encyclopedia back into my deck and that satisfies the effect of Time Warp. But, as previously noted, if I drew a card from the top of my deck and then played Time Warp, the card I drew should be returned to the top of my deck, because I knew that’s where it was.\n\nHowever, *a randomized deck is a randomized deck* – there’s no way of knowing the exact order of the cards, so keeping it shuffled is fine. You still don’t know what the order of the deck was, so the game state is effectively the same. [this is another super useful point]\n\n- **Q:** How does this card interact with [Quantum Flux](/card/03196)? Do you need to be able to recall what cards were in your discard pile? Or do you just return the drawn card to the top of your deck and proceed from there? **A:** If you know exactly what cards were in your discard pile, you should retrieve those cards and place them back in your discard pile in order to return the game state to exactly the way it was before Quantum Flux was played. If you can’t, the effect fails.\n\n- **Q:** How does this card interact with, say, playing a card in a free trigger window during a skill test? Minh investigates, and plays [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) before committing cards? **A:** Time Warp resets the game state to the way it was immediately before the action was performed. So anything that happened during that action gets reset, as well. That includes the playing of fast cards, the committing of cards to skill tests or spending of resources to boost skills, attacks of opportunity, all of it gets reset.\n\n- **Q:** Can I play [Time Warp](/card/03311) after an action ends with an investigator being defeated?\n **A:** If the action eliminated an investigator, another investigator can't play Time Warp in response to the action because the first investigator is no longer at the same location (they've been defeated).\n\n- **Q:** Do I get [Time Warp](/card/03311) back after I play [Time Warp](/card/03311)? **A:** Time Warp itself is not reset. It is currently being played while you are resetting things, so it is in an in-between state (not quite in play, not in your hand or discard pile, just sort of in limbo). Then once everything is reset, you discard Time Warp, as normal.",

If you have less cost of assets in play, and only \"-\" cost and skill cards in your hand, does this treachery have the potential to discard your whole hand and play area?  **A:** We talked this over and are making the following rulings:\n - Realm of Madness can be interpreted as, you should discard as many 1+ costing cards as possible from in play or hand in an attempt to reach X. If you cannot reach X by doing so, still discard as many cards as you can. As long as you discard at least one, you can avoid taking horror.\n - You do not need to discard 0-costing cards for this effect, because these cards cannot count toward X. If all you have in hand or play are 0-cost cards, you may choose to discard one of those to avoid taking 2 horror—you do not need to discard all of them.\n - You cannot discard a card with no cost at all (including a “null” cost, “-“) when resolving Realm of Madness.",
