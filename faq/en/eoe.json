In particular: Is [Norman Withers](/card/08004)’ “Play with the top card of your deck revealed.” ability active during setup (e.g. while he’s taking a mulligan)? Is [Lola Hayes](/card/03006) “You can only play, commit, or trigger abilities on Neutral cards or cards of your role.” ability active during setup (e.g. before drawing her opening hand, when she might trigger the abilities on [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264) or [Ancestral Knowledge](/card/07303))? **A:** To answer your question(s):\n - Norman Withers would not have the top card of his deck revealed during Setup.\n - Lola Hayes would not be limited by her constant ability during Setup. She could resolve the abilities on Ancestral Knowledge and Stick to the Plan before drawing her opening hand.",

    "text": "- **Q:** While [The Harbinger](/card/08006) is revealed and on top of my deck, can I shuffle my deck or look at cards in my deck? **A:** No. Your deck and cards in your deck cannot be manipulated in any way - this includes all possible card or game effects, such as looking at cards in your deck, moving cards in your deck, discarding cards from your deck, etc. -  *Edge of the Earth* Investigator Expansion Frequently Asked Questions section\n\n- **Q:** Who is allowed to activate the two-action ability to Discard it? Is it any player? Or just Norman? The ability says that it \"may be activated while The Harbinger is on top of your deck, as if it were in your threat area.\" Because that is part of the ability, it makes me think that only Norman can activate it, since it is only on top of \"your deck\" for Norman. Is that the intended reading? Or is the text allowing activation meant to treat The Harbinger \"as if\" it were in Norman's threat area for all investigators? **A:** Though I think I can see where the confusion comes from, The Harbinger was made with the intention of allowing another investigator at Norman’s location to spend the two actions and discard it from his deck, just like with other Weaknesses in a threat area.\n\n- **Q:** According to the rules, \"Any time a card is discarded, it is placed faceup on top of its owner's discard pile.\" But when cards are \"placed\", \"put into play\", or otherwise moved from one zone to another, rather than \"discarded\", we don't necessarily know whether they end up face-up or face-down. Given the above, my question is: how does [Body of a Yithian](/card/04244) [Norman Withers](/card/08004) interact with The Harbinger? Yithian Norman loses the normal Norman ability \"Play with the top card of your deck revealed.\" And The Harbinger's ability is \"Revelation - Place this card on top of your deck.\" So, reading The Harbinger in a vacuum, we might assume it ends up on top of Yithian Norman's deck face-down, as any card placed on top of your deck would. If Yithian Norman ends up with The Harbinger face-down on top of his deck, the natural result is that, unless he is able to draw 2 or more cards at a time, every draw for the rest of the game will be him drawing The Harbinger, placing it face-down on top of his deck, and never making progress through his deck. This is very punishing, but there doesn't seem to be any way for Yithian Norman to avoid it by a strict reading of the rules. **A:** According to rules as written, yes—Yithian Norman Withers must place The Harbinger facedown on top of his deck when he draws it, each time he draws it. Hopefully your Norman does not suffer such a fate! (Rules Form Q&A, June 2023)",

To draw a specific example, if [Monterey Jack](/card/08007)'s [reaction] ability draws [Cryptic Writings](/card/60215), is he allowed to trigger Cryptic Writing's ability and play it? More generally, when an ability triggers 'at the end of my turn', is that 'during my turn'? And similarly, if an ability triggers 'at the start of my turn' is that 'during my turn'? **A:** Short answer, yes, “at the end of your turn” is still “during your turn”, so you would be able to play Cryptic Writings if you drew it with Monterey Jack’s triggered ability. (By extension, “at the start of your turn” should also count as being “during your turn.”)",

Can I use it to trigger a fight ability that requires multiple actions, such as the triple-action ability on [Sledgehammer](/card/08096)? If so, does it ignore the additional action cost of that ability? **A:** This ability allows you to “take up to 3 different fight or evade actions.” This effectively grants you (up to) 3 additional actions, which each must be spent to trigger a different fight or evade ability (see [\"Different\"](/rules#Different) and [\"Take an action\" vs \"perform an action\"](/rules#take_an_action_vs_perform_an_action)). One of the 3 fight or evade actions taken by Discipline (Balance of Body) can be a multiaction ability, but if so, you must still pay the additional action cost of that ability, and those additional actions would have to come from your standard pool of actions or from a source other than Discipline (Balance of Body). You cannot use Discipline (Balance of Body) to use Sledgehammer’s triple-action on its own, nor can you use it to dodge the additional action cost of that ability. - FAQ, v.2.0, August 2022",

Based on the rule: If 1 or more cards are forcibly removed from an investigator’s deck and returned to the collection (such as when a card is exiled, or when a campaign effect forces an investigator to remove cards from their deck), that investigator must purchase cards so that a legal deck size is maintained. When purchasing cards in this manner, that investigator may purchase level 0 cards at 0 experience cost until a legal deck size is reached. I can see interpretations where the cost is 0 (+1 for Down the Rabbit Hole) per empty-card-replacement, or where \"at 0 experience\" reads as \"without paying an experience cost\". If the intent is for empty card-slot replacements to cost 1xp, what happens if the player doesn't have enough XP to refill their deck? Again, I see two possibilities: Pay all of your XP, effectively paying as much as you can; or If a deck cannot afford to buy itself back to full, the character becomes unplayable, so start a new deck. **A:** Fair question; no, Down the Rabbit Hole would not require an investigator to spend additional XP when needing to purchase level 0 cards to maintain a legal deck size.

If I upgrade a customizable card, for example \"Power Word\" ( I have two copies of this card in my deck) after completion of the campaign scenario, can I reduce experience cost of upgrading Power Word by 2 points ( it counts as first 2 cards I upgrade) or only by 1 point ( it counts as upgrading only one card)? **A:** Only 1; Down the Rabbit Hole’s discount must be applied to 2 different cards.

To use Enchanted Bow from hand via True Magick, you could exhaust True Magick “as if it were” Enchanted Bow, and spend the charge on True Magick to target a non-Elite enemy at a connecting location.\n - While revealing Enchanted Bow from your hand to resolve it, you do not account for its slots; those only matter if you put it into play.\n\n\n\n- **Q:** Can you provide a little clarity on how [True Magick](/card/08070) is intended to function? Can [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) use her extra action to trigger its abilities? Does it cease to be a tome while it is being treated as the revealed asset? **A:** True Magick acts as a direct copy of the revealed Spell asset, and you can exhaust True Magick or spend charges from it as if you were resolving abilities on the revealed Spell asset. True Magick would not be treated as a Tome during this effect, and Daisy could not trigger it with her additional action.\n\n- **Q:** What does it mean to treat [True Magick](/card/08070) as a revealed Spell asset? **A:** When you reveal a Spell asset using True Magick’s ability, True Magick essentially becomes a copy of the revealed asset, including its cost, name, text box, and Traits. Charges on True Magick may be spent while resolving that asset’s abilities. For example, when resolving the ability on [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090), you may spend up to 2 charges from True Magick to deal that much damage for your attack. As True Magick copies the revealed asset’s traits, it may interact with abilities such as the reaction ability on [Twila Katherine Price](/card/06244) and upgraded [Sign Magick](/card/54008). - FAQ, v.2.1, August 2023",

[Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) does not specify anything about engagement, but FAQ 2.10 says that \"The game state is considered to be altered throughout the duration of the indicated ability or action, from its initiation (including the paying of its costs, attacks of opportunity, etc)...\" and \"Other card abilities or game effects resolved during this duration are also resolved with the altered game state in mind.\" This seems to indicate that if you use Pocket Telescope to investigate as if at a location with a ready, unengaged enemy, that enemy will engage you (although it will not physically move to your threat area), and it will make an attack of opportunity against you. Is that correct? **A:** Attacks of Opportunity occur immediately after the cost of initiating the action, but before the application of the action’s effect. In other words, when you attempt to use Pocket Telescope’s “Investigate” action, the “cost” to initiate it is spending one of your player actions, and this is the moment when Attacks of Opportunity occur.

If this is NOT the case, then it would only apply to the first scenario.",
