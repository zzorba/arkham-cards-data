Only if those conditions are true could you “translate the Tome.”\n - If Forbidden Tome was in your hand and you used Knowledge is Power, all of the above would stay about the same except that you would no longer have to worry about “secrets” on Tome. If you drew 1 and then had 10 cards still in hand, then you could “translate the Tome.”\n\n- **Follow-up Q:** I thought that you would not be able to translate a Forbidden Tome that is in your hand because you would not be able to discard it due to abilities only interacting with cards in out of play areas if they explicitly say so. I.e. the card doesn’t explicitly say “discard from hand” and so it really means “discard from play” which you can’t do because it’s not in play. **A:** Forbidden Tome does not specify whether it must be discarded from hand or in play to resolve its effect, so you are free to discard it from either place while resolving Knowledge is Power.",

    "text": "- **Q:** Does [Lonnie Ritter](/card/60309) require a damaged asset for her ability to work? Or is this a case of \"doing as much as you can\", so as long as you can heal Lonnie, you can still target a non-damaged item instead? **A:** Lonnie Ritter’s ability states: “ Exhaust Lonnie Ritter and spend 1 resource: Choose an Item asset controlled by an investigator at your location. Heal 1 damage from that asset and 1 horror from Lonnie Ritter.” It is true that the only costs of the ability are exhausting Lonnie and spending 1 resource, and the choosing and healing of an item are effects, not costs. However, whenever you see the word “choose” in an ability, there are a few additional rules to keep in mind. These rules can be found under the [Target](/rules#Target) section of the Rules Reference.\n\n The term \"choose\" indicates that one or more targets must be chosen in order for an ability to resolve. The player resolving the ability must choose a game element (usually a card) that meets the targeting requirements of the ability. If an ability requires the choosing of a target, and there is no valid target (or not enough valid targets), the ability cannot be initiated.\nIn other words, you cannot use Lonnie’s ability if there is no Item to target with its effect. The question remains—can you choose an item with no damage on it (or even, an item with no health value at all?) simply to heal 1 horror from Lonnie. Thankfully, the Rules Reference answers this question as well, in that same section:\nA card is not an eligible target for an ability if the resolution of that ability's effect could not change the target's state. (For example, an exhausted enemy could not be chosen as the target of an effect that reads, \"choose and exhaust an enemy.\")\nSo there you have it—you must choose an eligible target in order to activate Lonnie’s ability, and an item that cannot be healed is not an eligible target. This is true even though healing 1 damage from the chosen item is an effect and not a cost, because the word “choose” indicates that one or more eligible targets must be chosen in order for the ability to correctly resolve, and a target can only be chosen if the ability’s effect has the potential to change its game state.",

Card effects can enable you to commit more than 1 card to another person’s skill test. \n - With Daredevil, you can commit it and the card it searches for to another investigator’s skill test.\n - With Practice Makes Perfect and Astronomical Atlas, both allow ways for you to commit an additional card to an eligible skill test, regardless of if you already committed to that test already.",

I always assumed it did, but I had doubts re-reading the rules because Neither Rain Nor Snow cancels \"all effects of the failed test\", but retaliate and alert are \"after applying all results for that skill test\", leading me to believe it wouldn't be cancelled. I believe the same question is applicable for investigations and the Haunted keyword, as it uses similar language. **A:** <s>Neither Rain nor Snow would not prevent an enemy with Retaliate/Alert from attacking after the failed test. Neither Rain nor Snow would only cancel effects that occur during Step 7 of the [Skill Test Timing](/rules#Skill_Test_Timing) (Apply skill test results), but Retaliate/Alert triggers after this timing point passes and after the skill test ends.</s> **Ruling overturned**: We are now ruling that Neither Rain nor Snow CAN cancel a Retaliate/Alert (and Haunted) effects that would trigger as a result of the failed test.\n\n- **Q:** A recent ruling on Neither Rain nor Snow stated that keywords like Alert and Retaliate (and presumably Haunted) are not \"effects of the skill test\" and in fact trigger at some point after the test ends [**NB this ruling has been overturned, see above**]. This raises three questions. First: what is the exact timing of the resolution of Alert et al. and do other effects have priority over them? Specifically, is [Live and Learn](/card/04200) resolved before or after resolving attacks/haunted effects? Second: Is there a difference between cards that reference \"effects *OF* a failed skill test\" (NRNS) and \"effects *FROM* a failed skill test\" - Live and Learn and more importantly, [Self-Sacrifice](/card/06157)? The latter has traditionally been assumed to allow the committer to resolve effects like Alert etc. rather than the performing investigator but this ruling makes that murkier and calls into question the intended use case of that skill. Third and finally, taking the wording of [Read the Signs](/card/06117) into account are we now to understand Haunted to be a keyword that *triggers* in St.6 but in fact sets up a delayed effect that resolves at a later timing point? Otherwise I'm unsure how Read the Signs is supposed to ignore Haunted (which is it's traditionally understood use case.) **A:** 1) Neither Rain nor Snow can cancel Alert/Retaliate (and Haunted), treating all as “effects of the failed skill test.” 2) If playing Live and Learn, Alert/Retaliate would have resolved already during Step 7 of the initial test, as “effects of the failed test.” 3) Yes, Read the Signs was always intended to be able to ignore Haunted, a “keyword on your location that would trigger during this investigation.” 4) There is also no mechanical difference between “effects of the failed test” and “effects from the failed test.”\n\n- **Q:** What kind of “effects of the failed skill test” does [Neither Rain nor Snow](/card/60502) allow you to cancel?\n**A:** Neither Rain nor Snow may cancel effects that trigger during Steps 6 & 7 of a failed skill test. This may include keywords such as alert, retaliate, and haunted, as well as negative effects on the scenario reference card that might trigger as a result of the failed skill test. - FAQ, v.2.1, August 2023",

    "text": "- **Q:** I have a question about effects like [Old Keyring](/card/09117), which have lasting effects \"for\" a skill test rather than \"during\" a skill test. Are other abilities that resolve during this skill test affected by Old Keyring's change to the shroud, or does it only affect the skill test itself? For a specific example: If I investigate a shroud 2 location using Old Keyring, and during the test I use [Lola Santiago](/card/04196)'s ability, do I need to pay 2 resources or 0 resources? Similarly if I play [Crack the Case](/card/05110) during this investigation, do the investigators get 2 resources, or 0 resources? **A:** To answer your question(s):\n - Yes, Old Keyring would give -2 shroud to the location for the duration of the investigation test; any abilities triggered during the test would be affected by this -2 shroud.\n - If you used Lola Santiago’s ability during the player windows of the test, the X on Lola would be 0 in your example.\n - Since clues are gained during Step 7 of an investigation skill test, Crack the Case would still be affected by the modified shroud value, and the X on it would be 0 in your example.",

    "text": "- **Q:** As of the latest FAQ and some recent rulings, we now have a pretty consistent and clear distinction between \"actions performed\" and \"actions taken\" [see [\"Take an action\" vs \"Perform/resolve an action\"](/rules#Take_An_Action_Vs_Perform_An_Action). So, how does [Quick Learner](/card/60530)k (and similar cards, like [Plan of Action](/card/07024)) work? Does it count actions performed, or actions taken? For instance, suppose I had access to some Fast or free triggered abilities with bold action designators, meaning they allow me to perform certain actions without spending action currency. Could I use two such abilities to perform two actions, thus granting me Quick Learner's difficulty reduction for the rest of my turn? Or do I only \"progress\" Quick Learner's effect by taking actions? If the latter, would using an ability with multiple action cost, such as Sledgehammer's two-action ability, progress me two actions or only one action? **A:** To answer your question(s):\n\n - Quick Learner (and Plan of Action) will apply to any action performed or taken by their controller/user during a round. They do not take into account whether the action was performed or taken.\n - The Free Triggered ability on a card like [Quickdraw Holster](/card/08089) does not cost what I’ll call a “player action”, but using it results in a Fight action being performed, so it will still be affected by Quick Learner.\n - [Sledgehammer](/card/08094)’s second ability that costs two what I’ll call “player actions” and only results in a single Fight action being performed, so it only counts as one action toward Quick Learner.\n\n- **Q:** If i fail the first action and play [Live and Learn](/card/04200) does the penalty from [Quick Learner](/card/60530) apply to the new skill test? **A:** The failed skill test and the test from Live and Learn are part of the same action, and would have the +1 difficulty from Quick Learner.
