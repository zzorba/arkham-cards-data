Previously, if I had an ally in play and wanted to play an ally, I would first have to discard that ally because I was “at my slot limit” for allies. With the new rule, I only have to discard the ally that is in play if playing a new ally would put me above my slot limit. This means that you are now able to play an asset while you are at your slot limit without discarding an asset, provided that asset gives you the slots you need to keep them both in play.",

As per the entry on “[Evade](/rules#Evade_Action)” in the Rules Reference, if an ability automatically evades 1 or more enemies, no skill test is made for the evasion attempt whatsoever. Consequentially, because no skill test is made, it is not considered a “successful” evasion. The investigator simply follows the steps for evading an enemy (exhausting it and breaking\nits engagement).\n  - For example: Patrice uses the ability on [Hope](/card/06031), which reads: “[action] If Hope is ready, exhaust or discard him: Evade. Attempt to evade with a base [agility] value of 5.

    "text": "- **Q:** Does [Arcane Research](/card/04109) with [Archaic Glyphs](/card/03025), where you're upgrading a non-<b><i>Spell</i></b> into a <b><i>Spell</i></b>? **A:** Arcane Research reads \"After each scenario of a campaign, reduce the experience cost of the first Spell card you upgrade before the next scenario by 1.\" In order to gain the experience discount from Arcane Research, you must be upgrading a card with the Spell trait. You would not get the experience discount if you are purchasing a new Spell, nor would you get the discount if you are upgrading a card that does not have the Spell trait (even if that card would upgrade into a card with the Spell trait). \n\n- <del>Additionally, the minimum experience cost for upgrading any card is always 1 (see [Experience](/rules#Experience)), so you would need to be paying 2 or more experience in order for the discount to apply.</del> **Ruling overturned**: I will reverse my earlier ruling to suit the language in the FAQ, as this directly contradicts the minimum stated in the Rules Reference. The 1xp minimum does not apply to upgrading cards, and Arcane Research can therefore decrease the xp cost to upgrade a card to 0. \n\n- **Q:** Can you include [Arcane Research](/card/04109) in your deck at the start of the campaign? If so, do you take the mental trauma? **A:** Yes, you can, and yes, you should. Any card effects that resolve when a card is purchased should be resolved when that card is chosen to be included in your starting deck.\n\n- **Q:** If you decide to purchase [Arcane Research](/card/04109) after a scenario, can you take advantage of the discount it provides immediately? **A:** No, you cannot. The text \"After each scenario of a campaign…\" indicates that Arcane Research must be in your deck at the time the scenario concludes in order to take advantage of its text. (Essentially, it triggers immediately after the scenario, and creates a lasting effect.) If you purchase it in between two scenarios, it is too late to trigger its ability for the scenario just played. [Note that this is different from a card like [Adaptable](/card/02110) which simply reads \"In between each game of a campaign...\" At the time you purchase Adaptable you are still in between two games of a campaign, so you may take advantage of its ability immediately.]\n\n- **Q:** How do [Adaptable](/card/02110), [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) and [Arcane Research](/card/04109) interact with Innsmouth scenarios and interludes where experience is not allowed to be spent? **A:** You **can** use Adaptable in between any scenarios in Innsmouth. You cannot use Arcane Research or Down the Rabbit Hole during times you cannot spend XP – essentially, you are unable to “upgrade” cards at these times, even at a discount.\n\n- **Q:** In The Innsmouth Conspiracy campaign, various scenarios instruct the players during the resolution to record experience, then \"not spend any of it yet\" (with later instructions, typically during a scenario intro, to spend the experience). Is this intended to be read as a blanket prohibition on spending any xp at all, or just a prohibition on the xp earned from that particular scenario? The exact wording is that we will be instructed to spend \"this experience\" at a later time, which seems to imply only the particular scenario's xp is locked away (as opposed to banked experience from a previous scenario, In The Thick of It, etc.) However, an email ruling from MJ seems to imply there is a total experience-spending lockout. Furthermore, even if there is a total prohibition on spending any xp after these scenarios, is it still possible to upgrade my deck by spending 0xp? For example, if my deck contained x2 [Arcane Research](/card/04109), then upgrading one copy of [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) from level 0 to level 2 would cost 0xp, which seemingly would not violate even a total ban on spending xp. **A:** To answer your question(s):\n - In the Innsmouth Conspiracy, when instructed to not spend earned XP from a scenario, this would include unspent XP gained outside of that scenario. In other words, no XP can be spent during that time.\n - You would also not be able to upgrade your cards during times you cannot spend XP, even if you had a way of avoiding spending XP at that time.",

Can I trigger Ritual Candles again? (I know you can't when you reveal multiple tokens simultaneously (say through [Olive McBride](/card/04197)) but I'm less certain here.) **A:** You sure can! Actually, you can even when revealing multiple tokens with Olive as well, as long as they aren’t being ignored/canceled.

The indicated ability or action is resolved with the altered game state in mind, but the actual game state remains unchanged.\n  - This includes all steps of the indicated ability/action, including the paying of its costs, attacks of opportunity (where applicable), and resolving each aspect of its effect.\n  - Other card abilities or game effects do not resolve with the altered game state in mind; only the indicated ability/action. - FAQ, v.1.7, March 2020",

    "text": "- **Q:** If I fail a test that has costs other than actions associated with it (like spending ammo or charges), do I need to respend costs to 'attempt that test again'? My read is no: it's not a new action, it's just 'go straight back into the skill test', without spending costs. Is that correct? **A:** Correct. The investigator does not need to pay any costs associated with the skill test again (such as ammo, actions spent, etc), although anything spent to improve the previous test (like committed costs or resources on a Talent) are indeed lost at the end of the first test.\n\n- **Q:** Does a skill test end at the same time as the action spent to trigger it, if it is, for instance, an **Investigate** test or **Fight** test? Do end of skill test and end of action effects trigger at the same time? **A:** Correct, an action that is a skill test (such as Investigate or Fight) ends at the same time that the skill test ends, so both such effects would trigger at the same time.\n\n- **Q:** A recent ruling on Neither Rain nor Snow stated that keywords like Alert and Retaliate (and presumably Haunted) are not \"effects of the skill test\" and in fact trigger at some point after the test ends [**NB this ruling has been overturned, see [Neither Rain nor Snow](/card/60502)**]. This raises three questions. First: what is the exact timing of the resolution of Alert et al. and do other effects have priority over them? Specifically, is [Live and Learn](/card/04200) resolved before or after resolving attacks/haunted effects? Second: Is there a difference between cards that reference \"effects *OF* a failed skill test\" (NRNS) and \"effects *FROM* a failed skill test\" - Live and Learn and more importantly, [Self-Sacrifice](/card/06157)? The latter has traditionally been assumed to allow the committer to resolve effects like Alert etc. rather than the performing investigator but this ruling makes that murkier and calls into question the intended use case of that skill. Third and finally, taking the wording of [Read the Signs](/card/06117) into account are we now to understand Haunted to be a keyword that *triggers* in St.6 but in fact sets up a delayed effect that resolves at a later timing point? Otherwise I'm unsure how Read the Signs is supposed to ignore Haunted (which is it's traditionally understood use case.) **A:** 1) Neither Rain nor Snow can cancel Alert/Retaliate (and Haunted), treating all as “effects of the failed skill test.” 2) If playing Live and Learn, Alert/Retaliate would have resolved already during Step 7 of the initial test, as “effects of the failed test.” 3) Yes, Read the Signs was always intended to be able to ignore Haunted, a “keyword on your location that would trigger during this investigation.” 4) There is also no mechanical difference between “effects of the failed test” and “effects from the failed test.”",

This seems a bit more prickly as I need to initiate a play action before I can give fast to the card... But then also fast cards don't use the play Action to enter play?  **A:** Yes, you can. Fast assets can be played in any player window during your turn, including the one after your last action is taken. Fence gives the card fast before it is actually played, so this is taken into account during its initiation sequence.\n\n- **Q:** [Double, Double](/card/05320) vs [Pay Day](/card/04233). Can the [reaction] of Double, Double be initiated despite the end of the turn [from Pay Day]? If the turn immediately ends, does this mean even if Pay Day is played again, no actions were performed and the second pay day will grant no resources? **A:** Technically, you can use Double, Double to play a card that ends your turn twice, even though it ends your turn. Ending your turn doesn’t mean that you can’t trigger effects, it just means that you can no longer take actions. Since the second playing of the card doesn’t cost an action in this case, you can go ahead and resolve it even though your turn has ended. HOWEVER, due to the specific text on Pay Day, doing so would essentially do nothing. It says that you gain 1 resource for each action you performed this turn. Since you are playing it outside of your turn, you would gain 0 resources from the second copy of Pay Day (since the first copy ended your turn.)\n\n- **Q:** Per FAQ 2.0 entry 2.19 [\"Take an action\" vs \"Perform/resolve an action\"](/rules#Take_An_Action_Vs_Perform_An_Action)] we are told to distinguish between effects that instruct a player to perform an action and ones that instruct a player to take an action. The implication appears to be that only the former are intended to \"count\" for effects that count how many actions have been taken so far in a turn. However, the most commonly played card that counts actions taken, [Pay Day](/card/04233), actually counts how many actions have been \"performed\". Is that simply imprecise templating? Similarly [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) triggers when actions are \"performed\" despite the common understanding that only abilities that cost actions in the first place can be taxed by FiF. Finally, and in the same vein, bold action designators on free triggered abilities or reactions also \"perform\" actions. Am I correct that they are not intended to be taxed by FiF or count towards Pay Day? **A:** Frozen in Fear requires 1 additional action to be spent when performing basic actions, granted actions, or Free Triggered Ability actions of the specified types. We have decided on the following clarifications for Pay Day:\n\n - Pay Day will grant 1 resource for each basic action taken, any effect that states “perform an X action”, any effect that states “take an X action”, and Free Triggered Abilities with a bold action trigger.\n - Pay Day will NOT grant resources for Fast cards played or “action triggered abilities” that require multiple player actions to be spent on a single action performed (ex. the second ability on [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) that only counts as one Fight action).\n\n\n- **Follow-up Q:** To be completely clear, does Frozen in Fear make the move granted from [Shortcut](/card/03232) cost an action or not? **A:** Yes, the move on Shortcut (2) would then cost an action.",

If you take a look at the [Initiation Sequence appendix on page 22 of the RR](/rules#Appendix_I_Initiation_Sequence), you’ll see that the second bullet point says: “Determine the cost to play the card or initiate the ability. If it is established that the cost <u>(taking modifiers into account)</u> can be paid, proceed with the remaining steps of this sequence.” (emphasis mine). The initiation sequence takes all modifiers to the card’s cost into account when determining if it can be played, so you can play a 2 cost event even if you have 0 resources, so long as the cost is reduced by 2.",

Investigators that have abilities that trigger before step 9 can resolve those steps. \n\n - **Follow-up Q:** Since opening hands are resolved before step 10, can “Ashcan” Pete end up with Duke in his opening hand? i.e. one should look ahead and know that one should shuffle Duke into your deck? Secondly how exactly should Lily Chen resolve setup for this scenario with respect to her Disciplines? **A:** We would say that for Yithian Lily and Yithian “Ashcan” Pete, they can have Disciplines and Duke in play when the game begins. Your question sparked a conversation about ways we might expand the standard Setup and where cards that “begin the game” would actually be put into play, or at least what step they would be set aside at.

This swap occurs during Step 10 of [Setting Up the Game](/rules#Appendix_III_Setting_Up_The_Game), as outlined in the Rules Reference.

    "text": "- **Q:** *[part 1 of 2, splitting for clarity]* I am a bit confused as to how [Handcuffs](/card/04265) interacts with some encounter cards. [The Truth is Hidden](/card/03121) says \"flip\" clues to doom, not \"place\" doom. Would it still flip the doom on [Seeker of Carcosa](/card/03144)? **A:** Flipping clues to their doom side is not the same as placing them. In this instance, the token has already been placed on the card, so Handcuffs will not prevent the tokens from then being flipped over to their doom side. Note that the agendas in Echoes of the Past each read “After 1 or more clues are placed on an enemy in play: Flip those clues to their doom side,” meaning the flipping occurs after the tokens are already placed.\n\n- **Q:** *[part 2 of 2, splitting for clarity]* [Mysterious Chanting](/card/01171) and [Dance of the Yellow King](/card/03097) look for a cultist in play. If a cultist or lunatic is handcuffed they cannot ready, but they might be the only cultist or lunatic in play. Are those cards effectively negated? **A:** As for Mysterious Chanting and Dance of the Yellow King, the answer is… sort of. Mysterious Chanting simply adds doom to the nearest Cultist, so if the nearest Cultist is handcuffed, then yes, it will do nothing. Dance of the Yellow King is trickier. It reads: “… If you fail, the nearest Lunatic enemy readies, moves (one location at a time) until it reaches your location, engages you, and makes an immediately attack.” Technically, the movement, engagement and attack aspects of this effect are not dependent on the enemy readying. While typically only ready enemies can move, engage, or attack, there is no rule stopping them from doing so while exhausted if an effect explicitly instructs them to. So strange as it may seem, if the nearest Lunatic enemy is handcuffed, it won’t ready, but it will still move to you, engage you, and attack. (Note that this would be different if the effect used the word “then” somewhere in it, for example “readies, then moves…”)",
