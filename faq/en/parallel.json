When I play [Read the Signs](/card/06117), when can I trigger the [reaction] trigger ability of the heirloom to draw 1 card? Does it trigger when I play this card, or after I completely resolve Read the Signs and discard this card? **A:** Yes, the Heirloom of Hyperborea can trigger off of any Spell card its controller plays. This trigger occurs after the Spell card has resolved in full.",

    "text": "- **Q:** I have a question regarding advanced Wendy's weakness, which reads: \"Remove all non-weakness cards in your discard pile from the game. If no cards were removed by this effect, shuffle this card back into your deck. Otherwise, take 3 direct horror.\" Does that \"otherwise\" mean that you take 3 horror if you removed cards from your discard? Or is it that you take 3 horror if you have no more cards to remove and you can't shuffle it back to your deck? **A:** To answer your question(s):\n - The short answer: you will take 3 horror if you removed at least 1 card from the game with this effect.\n - The longer answer: when you draw this card, it presents you with a command: remove all non-weakness cards in your discard pile from the game. You would do this, then look at the rest of the card for a follow-up. If you didn’t remove anything, you’d shuffle Abandoned and Alone back into your deck; but if you did remove at least one card—the “otherwise” condition--you take the 3 direct horror.",
