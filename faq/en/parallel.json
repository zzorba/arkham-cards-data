When I play [Read the Signs](/card/06117), when can I trigger the [reaction] trigger ability of the heirloom to draw 1 card? Does it trigger when I play this card, or after I completely resolve Read the Signs and discard this card? **A:** Yes, the Heirloom of Hyperborea can trigger off of any Spell card its controller plays. This trigger occurs after the Spell card has resolved in full.",

If no cards were removed by this effect, shuffle this card back into your deck. Otherwise, take 3 direct horror.\" Does that \"otherwise\" mean that you take 3 horror if you removed cards from your discard? Or is it that you take 3 horror if you have no more cards to remove and you can't shuffle it back to your deck? **A:** To answer your question(s):\n - The short answer: you will take 3 horror if you removed at least 1 card from the game with this effect.\n - The longer answer: when you draw this card, it presents you with a command: remove all non-weakness cards in your discard pile from the game. You would do this, then look at the rest of the card for a follow-up. If you didn’t remove anything, you’d shuffle Abandoned and Alone back into your deck; but if you did remove at least one card—the “otherwise” condition--you take the 3 direct horror.",

Will it be removed from the game like [Jim's Trumpet](/card/02012) or [Patrice's Violin](/card/06016) in The City of Archives? **A**: Since Pete’s Guitar doesn’t use the unique icon next to its name, it’s not considered unique, and you don’t need to remove it when playing The City of Archives.
