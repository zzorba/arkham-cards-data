She collapses to the ground, reeling from the spiritual impact. Her body writhes in torment, but none of the other witches step forward to help, instead watching with equal parts terror and fascination.

You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn’t noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge’s inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. “We must leave this place at once,” Sanford says stoically. “This being possesses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.”\nAnette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. “You look familiar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.” She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul. You hate to admit it, but Sanford is right. You turn and flee with the rest of the Lodge, hoping you are fast enough to escape the witch’s magic.\nYour escape is a blur. Witches and spirits chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. Other members of the Lodge are perhaps not so fortunate. Having scattered in many directions, you’re not sure how many of them escaped, and you don’t see Carl Sanford anywhere, though you suspect he had a plan for this outcome.",

Keziah nods knowingly. A sinister smirk frolics on her lips. \"Come, sisters. Now is the time to reap thet reward for your loyalty.\"\nOutmatched, Carl Sanford and the Lodge members flee into the woods, leaving you and the coven alone. One by one, you and your new allies each sign the Black Book of Azathoth. Keziah grants you each a shred of her knowledge, of her power, and then she tells you what your loyalty has bought. She speaks of the Great Old Ones, of immortality, of the Messenger and their daemonic wisdom. From henceforth, you are forever changed…",
