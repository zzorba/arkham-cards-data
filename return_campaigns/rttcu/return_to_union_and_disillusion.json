Why, I have cheated the Devil,” Sanford responds with a sinister grin. You notice the words of his tome are now glowing with a spectral radiance. “Keziah signed the Black Book of Azathoth in order to learn the secrets of the universe. A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\nAnette clenches her jaw and turns toward you. “You cannot even begin to fathom the secrets this monster now possesses.

Sanford turns to the other members of his Order and points to you. “Kill them,” he commands.\n“Erynn, give us cover!” Anette barks to the red-haired witch next to her. The witch nods in response and waves a wooden rod in front of her, creating a cloud of mist that masks your presence. “We have to get out of here. Go!” Anette yells.\nYour escape is a blur. Robed members of the Silver Twilight cult chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. You motion for Anette and the others to join you, but she shakes her head. “We’ll meet again soon.” The edges of the witches’ cloaks bleed into the night sky, and with a swirl of darkness, they vanish one by one.",

      "text": "Anette approaches, confronting the remnant's ethereal shell. \"Sister! We are the ones who have called you here from the great beyond.\" The shattered revenant turns its attention to Anette, and the rest of her coven watch in anticipation.\n\"What are you doing, you fool? This spirit is no mere witch!\" Carl Sanford yells out. But it is too late. Anette ignores Sanford, continuing to speak to the spectral presence. \"For years we have suffered injustice after injustice. Share with me your secrets, sister. Together, as one mind, body, and soul, we can begin anew.\"\nThe ghost reaches out to her with a long, skeletal arm. Anette's sisters gasp as their high priestess steps forward and kneels before the being, offering herself. With a sudden rush of energy, the phantom soul is drawn inside Anette. She collapses to the ground, reeling from the spiritual impact. Her body writhes in torment, but none of the other witches step forward to help, instead watching with equal parts terror and fascination. Finally, Anette rises to her feet, her eyes aglow with mystical power. When she speaks, it is not her voice. \"Sisters. Rejoice, for I am reborn,\" Keziah says.\nCarl Sanford taps you with his cane. You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn't noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge's inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. \"We must leave this place at once,\" Sanford says stoically. \"This being posses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.\"\nAnette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. \"You look famililar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.\" She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul… but perhaps this is the chance you have been waiting for?",

With the ritual concluded, the island seems to have returned to normal—but was the ritual successful, or did it fail? You make your way to the center of the island to find out what happened. As you arrive, you find Anette and her coven heavily wounded, and the Lodge stands victorious. Carl Sanford holds a thick leather tome in his hands, its pages glowing with arcane power. “What have you done?!” Anette yells. Several members of her coven surround her. They are embattled, but you have no doubt they would lay down their life to protect their high priestess from harm.\n“What have I done? Why, I have cheated the Devil,” Sanford responds with a sinister grin. You notice the words of his tome are now glowing with a spectral radiance. “Keziah signed the Black Book of Azathoth in order to learn the secrets of the universe. A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\nAnette clenches her jaw and turns toward you. “Listen to me. You cannot even begin to fathom the secrets this monster now possesses. You must stop him, no matter the cost.”\nYou hold your tongue, but in the back of your mind, you suspect Anette is right. Sanford has tricked you. This is what he was after all along. Perhaps he considers this “protecting humanity,” but the truth is that he has endangered the lives of others over and over again in order to serve his own greed and lust for power. However, before you can confront Sanford, he turns to the other members of his Order and points to you. “This one is no longer useful,” he explains. “Kill them all.”\n“Erynn, give us cover!” Anette barks to the red-haired witch next to her. The witch nods in response and waves a wooden rod in front of her, creating a cloud of mist that masks your presence. “We have to get out of here. Go!” Anette yells.\nYour escape is a blur. Robed members of the Silver Twilight cult chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. You motion for Anette and the others to join you, but she shakes her head. “We’ll meet again soon.” The edges of the witches’ cloaks bleed into the night sky, and with a swirl of darkness, they vanish one by one.",
