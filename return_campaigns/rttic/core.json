You also count as a [[Deep One]] investigator as long as you have a permanent player card that grants the Deep One trait added to your deck.\nBeing a Deep One investigator persists from one scenario to the next. When you end the scenario through reaching a resolution, when you are defeated or when you resign as a Deep One investigator, you continue to count as such until the beginning of the next scenario. This includes interludes, flashbacks, resolutions and setup instructions which might refer to Deep One investigators."

Instead of fully replacing the original Caverns, you should use a combination of the original set and the new one.\nWhen a scenario card instructs you gather the Return to Flooded Caverns set, replace one of each Tidal Pool, Underground River and Underwater Cavern from original Flooded Caverns set with its counterpart from the Return to Flooded Caverns. So you should end up with six unique cards which will then be used in the scenario."
