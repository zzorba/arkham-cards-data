According to the article's source—who goes unnamed—the mansion has become a tangled mess of overgrowth and serpents. The article reports that a recent expedition returned with several strange artifacts in tow, meant to be displayed in the Hastings manor. You wonder if this has anything to do with your expedition to find the Eztli. Even if these events are unrelated, your investigation might connect you with others who can assist you in turn."

Their methods are secret and furtive, and their motives elude you still. However, one piece of vital information has come to light.\n“They seek a place known as the Nexus of N’kai,” Ichtaca claims. A map of Central America lies on the table before you, marked with the previous expedition’s trail. “I have heard of this place, but its exact location is not known to me.” Once again, your mysterious guide appears to know more than she lets on.\nWith no other leads to follow, you are left with no choice.
