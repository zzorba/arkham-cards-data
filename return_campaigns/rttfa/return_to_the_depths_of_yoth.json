With your wounds slowing you down and panic seeping into every one of your decisions, your death at the hands of these creatures is inevitable. Despair worms its way into your mind. When the serpents inevitably catch up to you, you are crossing one of the cavern’s many long bridges of stone that span a wide, dark chasm. Serpent creatures on both sides of the chasm flank you, spear tips corralling you against the precarious edge of the bridge. A small hunk of stone cracks at your heel and detaches, falling into the inky void below. You do not hear it strike the floor of the chasm. There is no hope to escape or flee this time—you have no choice but to accept your fate. The spear tips press you closer to the edge. You close your eyes and fall.",
