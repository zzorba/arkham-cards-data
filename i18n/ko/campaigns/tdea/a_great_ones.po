"<i>Following scenario 3–A, the dreamers are on their way to the Cold Wastes wherein lies unknown Kadath…</i>\n"
"You are nudged out of a sleepless reverie by a furry forehead. You look down to find the black cat peering up at you. “Hey. I see you’ve made some progress.” You’re not quite sure if you would call this progress. Though you are finally on your way to the Cold Wastes, you haven’t pinned down the exact location of unknown Kadath, and you have no idea what to expect when you arrive."

msgid "“Whoa,” the cat says suddenly, “you’re not looking too good, you know.” It gazes up at you with unconcerned but curious eyes. You ask what it means. “You can’t tell? You look sick. You eating enough? Whatever, it doesn’t matter. You can walk, can’t you? That’s good enough.”"

msgid "“Where’s what’s-his-name?” the black cat asks, searching for Randolph. You try to explain what happened, but you can barely choke out the words. “Say no more. I get it.” The cat ponders the situation, not seeming to care much about Randolph’s terrible fate. “Well, I guess the thing I was going to say is no longer going to be said,” it riddles."

msgid "“Don’t mind me. I just wanted to see if you’re alive.” You begin to tell the black cat of your troubles, and it tilts its head to the side with a look of catlike curiosity. “Huh. That’s funny. Did I say I cared what you had to say? I don’t <i>think</i> I did. Oh well. Let me make it more clear: I only care about whether you’re able to fulfill your duty. I don’t care how you are feeling.” The cat’s glaring eyes never blink. “Well, good luck. You’ll need it.” It bounds off into a shadow and vanishes."

msgid "Skip the rest of this interlude."

msgid "You ask the black cat if it knows what you’ll find in Kadath. “Sort of,” it answers. “I’ve foreseen your arrival in Kadath for some time now. I’ve seen a lot of this, in fact. But it’s…well, it’s not playing out exactly the same way. Or maybe I just didn’t <i>see</i> it the same way. Regardless, I think you’re on the right path. After all, it’s the only path that’s left. I know a little more about what you’ll see when you get there, but I’m afraid that if I tell you, you’ll see it differently, too. Don’t worry about it. You’re doing fine. Get to Kadath. Find the land of the Great Ones. Everything else will fall into place when you arrive. As long as you don’t mess this up. These beings that you face, the ones whose names I do not wish to speak, they don’t just threaten the Dreamlands. They threaten existence itself. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have somewhere to be.”"
