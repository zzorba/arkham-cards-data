msgid "Scenario VI: Blood From Stones"
msgstr "시나리오 VI: 돌에서 흐르는 피"

msgid "The stormy gray skies that have hung over your entire voyage persist as your ship makes port at Singapore.  You find yourself bolstered in spite of the weather, reassured by your escapes from the cult pursuers.  Perhaps here you may finally go back on the offensive.  You book yourself into a modest hotel by the waterfront and resume your investigations, but unlike the other stops in your journey, the enemy is nowhere to be found.  Surely here at the trail's end there must be some sign, some trace of this ever-present network of assassins, but where?  You are returning to your dockside hotel when the answer manifests before you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exhausted from your harrowing encounters with the cult, you breathe a slight sigh of relief as your ship finally comes within distant view of Singapore.  With the long days and nights you've endured, preparing and worrying, you hope that the cult's plans aren't so far along as to be unstoppable.  The steady rain that has followed your journey continues to pelt you as you disembark at the city's harbor.  You wonder where to begin looking for the cult, and the answer comes quicker than you may have liked."

msgid "The sky above you shimmers, then tessellates into strange geometrical patterns.  The distortions bend, forming a dome around the city as they merge recursively.  You reel at the sudden spectacle, but nobody else around you seems to even notice the fractured sky.  You can only assume that this phenomenon is tailor-made to affect you alone, but if that's the case, then you are left with some grim conclusions.  As the dome surrounds the whole city, you must also assume that it is meant to trap you in Singapore.  This would also mean that the cult's ultimate goal is not in Singapore itself, but is somewhere nearby, and the city was simply the easiest rallying point.  If all of this is true, then you must find a way to break this abstract dome and learn just where the cult's plans will culminate."

"The geometric patterns of the dome close in on your mind, squeezing your consciousness and sending jolts of pain through your head.  You strain to keep your wits through the ordeal until suddenly, the sensation stops.  You open your eyes to the same sight of non-Euclidean angles, but now folded into a sphere around you.  Beyond the translucent dome you can see nothing but an infinite void.  Are you in another dimension?  Another reality?\n"
"Minutes pass in tense silence before you dare attempt to move.  You find that physically moving your arms and legs achieves nothing, but focusing your mind on motion propels you slowly around the sphere.  You may not even be present in this space physically, but you are trapped nevertheless.  With no other possible goal, you focus your mind on the barrier.  You force your mind to accept its impossible existence, trying to determine how the barrier works and hopefully use that knowledge to free yourself.\n"
"For hours you grapple with the geometric dome, learning the flow of patterns and sequence of convergences.  Gradually, you find an imperfection -- a small gap in the barrier.  As it was created by human minds, the dome can never truly be perfect.  You hurl yourself at the gap, sliding between angles that you rightly shouldn't be able to.\n"
"The non-Euclidean designs clash inside your mind once again, but this time once the cascade stops, the sounds of Singapore fade back in around you, along with the light patter of drizzling rain.  Your eyes open to find yourself lying in an alleyway not far from the harbor.  How long were you in that extradimensional pocket?  And where have your enemies gone?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the shattering of the barrier, the agents of the cult blend back into the crowds of Singapore, leaving you confused, but relieved.  The city took no notice of the attack against you, but surely there must be some evidence left behind.  You return to Singapore's masonic lodge to investigate any connections to the traitors, only to discover that many of their members disappeared around the same time that your pursuers did.  You give a brief explanation to the lodge's grand master of the events at the Philadelphia branch, sparing the more otherworldly details, and insist on conducting your own search inside.\n"
"In one of the building's many basement rooms, you finally find what James Wycliffe first hired you to find: the missing artifacts.  Piles of twisted stone blocks and impossibly carved figurines lie scattered about, along with detailed notes on their construction.  Included with the notes are architectural plans of a sort for monolithic stone pillars, constructed and positioned to bend space in the area between them.  Your suspicions about the spatial warping stone are confirmed at last.  This plan will allow them to move R'lyeh from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean up to the surface, and awaken their master <b>Cthulhu</b>.\n"
"Unfortunately, the cultists were careful about not writing down any hints as to where their project will culminate.  You pore over the blueprints to find something -- anything that could help you stop their plans.  In the footnotes of one of the technical drawings, you discover a small diagram depicting a failsafe for experimenting with the non-Euclidean stone. This ward acts as an anchor to keep the architects safe while they twist reality.  This spell might be useful in countering the reality-twisting magic the cultists have used against you."

"The ultimate destination of the cult's project still troubles you.  The site is still unknown to you, but it must be both large enough to raise the sunken island of R'lyeh, but somewhere that the public or authorities wouldn't see.  Moreover, it must also be somewhere that the cult could easily move people and supplies to.  You hope that the cult hasn't found a way to twist space to fully hide their project.  For lack of better leads, you return to Singapore harbor to see if anyone has seen the cultists departing all at once.\n"
"You step up to the notice board, ready to scour the list of ships for details, when an announcement catches your eye.  All ship travel through the Sunda Strait is suspended for the foreseeable future due to major volcanic activity in the area.  The Krakatoa volcano, which famously erupted and sank over forty years ago, is active once again, with a new volcanic island expected to form from the remaining caldera.\n"
"The pieces begin to connect.  An easily accessible location that the public is currently prohibited from visiting, and with the volcanic activity providing as much fresh stone as the architects need.  With its close proximity to Singapore, the Krakatoa caldera is the perfect candidate, but you must confirm your suspicions.  You arrange a meeting with the harbormaster, and after a small bribe, he informs you that a group of American entrepreneurs recently departed to mine pumice from the caldera.  The arrangements were made months ago in spite of the expected volcanic activity, and the harbormaster shows you the proof of permission -- signed by one of the masonic traitors!  This breakthrough confirms your suspicions and gives you your destination.  You must get to the Krakatoa basin to bring an end to this plot."
