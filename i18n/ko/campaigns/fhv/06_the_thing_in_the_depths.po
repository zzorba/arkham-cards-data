msgid "The road to Eastwick Bog branches sharply off from the same road you took in from Akwan. The landscape is incredibly vibrant, almost tropical, with rainbow-patterned tree trunks standing guard at the edge of black mirrored ponds. Dr. Marquez and Judith trade friendly barbs in the truckbed, occasionally swatting away gnats. As the conversation turns sour, you attempt to break the tension by asking Judith for a hunting story."

"Judith doesn’t miss a beat. “See this scar? I got it in a fight at a speakeasy. Some rich kid cut me with a broken bottle. A friendly scuffle, y’know. His family was from this area, and very rich, I’ll add again, and they were so afraid a scandal’d break out that they offered me a job. Not that I woulda ratted on him.”\n"
"“I don’t know what I expected to hear from a bodyguard, but it wasn’t that,” says Dr. Marquez, possibly annoyed. An acrid breeze, smelling sweetly of death, blows off the bog and ends the conversation. The truck comes to a stop. Judith rolls her eyes, pulls on a pair of old waders, and walks out onto the bog, rifle slung over her shoulder.\n"
"“Believe me or don’t. I’m just here for the money.”"

"The young woman’s steely demeanor relaxes. “Something big lives in Eastwick Bog. An apex predator the size of a killer whale, with razor sharp teeth and too many eyes. Smells like rotten seaweed.” You tell her it sounds like she has personal experience with the creature, and she nods. “I owe it. Or it owes me. See this?” She points to the wicked scar on her cheek. “That thing almost took my eye. I plan to settle the score.” Dr. Marquez is nonplussed. “I guess you think an academic will buy up any story, but if you expect me to believe—” An acrid breeze, smelling sweetly of death, blows off the bog and stops Judith mid-retort. The truck comes to a stop. Judith pulls a bandana over her nose and mouth, slides into a pair of old waders and walks out onto the bog, rifle slung over her shoulder.\n"

msgid "“I really didn’t get what everyone else liked about Journey to the Center of the Earth. A hollow earth? It sounds insane,” Theo chatters as rain hammers down on the truck cabin. The landscape is incredibly vibrant, almost tropical, with rainbow-patterned tree trunks standing guard at the edge of black mirrored ponds. The truck suddenly hits a patch of deep mud and squelches to a halt. “I think I need some help,” Theo says."

msgid "After some struggle, you coax the truck out of the pothole and point Theo through a mess of other potholes onto a rocky bank. Several bags of supplies fall out of the truckbed. Theo waves dismissively. “I can get those on the way back. I’ve got some family stuff back in Akwan to take care of.” Theo leaves you at the edge of the bog, wreathed in mist in the chill rain."

msgid "Theo presses his shoulder to the rear of the truck as you rev the gas. The vehicle lurches forward only to bury the front tire in another pothole. Theo jumps into the truck next to you and lets out an exhasperated sigh. “I think you’ll have to continue on foot from here. It’s not that far.”"

msgid "Each investigator begins the next scenario with 2 fewer resources."

msgid "The road to Eastwick Bog is covered in rough potholes that reflect a brilliant, prismatic sheen in the sky above. Theo stops the truck as the road grows treacherous. “I’m sorry to do this, but this old girl can’t make the trip through all that mud,” Theo says. You step off the truckbed, say goodbye to Theo, and walk down the muddy road past a close thicket of gaudy, colored trees riven with cracks of light."
msgstr ""

msgid "The moonlight is as bright as day, illuminating the desolate landscape around the truck like something in a Grimm fairy tale. An acrid breeze blows off the bog, smelling sweetly of death, as you pull to a stop on the shoreline and look up at the moon, veiled in gathering clouds. A single thin tree stands silhouetted against the moon, reaching up like a grasping hand. You hoist your supplies out of the truck and look back. The thin tree has disappeared, leaving a dark ripple in its wake."

msgid "“I hate this bog. I assume that everyone who’s gone missing from the Vale was sent here, it’s so dangerous. Yet still, Mother Rachel told me to come here. I wish I were back in New York,” River says, looking out of place in their oversized waders. They press a basket into your arms. “Get me to some cranberries and be quick about it.”"

Once I’ve taken this island back from the Atwoods, she’ll be first to go.”"

msgid "“Take a look at this,” Dr. Marquez beckons you to a striped trunk. “It’s impossible. Five different species in one. I can’t think of a grafting method that could produce something like this.” She taps the trunk with her cane, reaches down, and pulls up a thick many- colored bundle of roots that look like angel’s hair. “They’re sturdy, though. Their roots resemble the mycelia network of a mushroom colony, but are much thicker. Stick to the trees, and you won’t sink.”"

msgid "You awaken in a glade near the bog shore with Theo sitting nearby. Before you can say anything, the young man shushes you and points to a break in the trees. Silhouetted against a sliver of light is a magnificent stag. Its long, looping antlers are covered in moss and fungal growths and it glows with a pale incandescence. Theo grins. “Isn’t it beautiful? I mean, I’m sure it’d kill us if it saw us. But, well,” he waves his hand. “I’m glad I found you. There was something moving down on the shore, but I didn’t bother checking. I’m just glad you’re okay.”"

msgid "You can tell from the moment your clippers cut the stem that something is wrong. The reptile moans as you lift the glowing gray blossom from its back, then opens its mouth to expose rows of serrated teeth as it snaps at you. Arsenic white fluid spurts from the hollow stem, coating you with a stinking secretion that burns your skin. You nearly drop the blossom as you stumble back, realizing your mistake. The vapors from the fluid make you dizzy and lend the forest an exaggerated fluorescence. The poor reptilian creature flails in pain and sinks, leaving swirls of milky blood on the surface. A sharp pain forces you to drop the alkaloid blossom, and you examine your hand to find a sharp cut on your palm. The shape of the wound suggests the stem had begun to penetrate the flesh. You put the sample in a specimen jar and head for the southern shore."

"A gun clicks behind you. “Hold back,” Judith says emerging from the undergrowth. She takes aim at the reptilian hybrid. “Keep clear of that thing.”\n"
"Dr. Marquez steps between Judith and the creature. “With all due respect, that ‘thing’ is completely harmless.” As if to underscore her point, the creature chews a flowering branch.\n"
"“Nothing on this island is harmless,” Judith retorts. “Everything, even the sweet turtles and the cute deer and the damn rabbits are deadly. I don’t know why the villagers aren’t more afraid. I can guarantee you this turtle...thing doesn’t just munch flowers.”\n"
"“If you shoot the thing I came here to survey, you will not be paid,” Dr. Marquez says coldly. The professor pulls out a notebook and begins sketching the creature. A hush falls over the group as a pair of frogs swim across the pond in front of the creature. In an instant, the chelydran hybrid opens its mouth to expose 4 separate rows of teeth lining the back of its throat, then snaps up both frogs.\n"
"Dr. Marquez puts down her sketchbook. “What in the hell—”"
msgstr ""

msgid "You find the blossoming reptile in a black mirrored pond. Before you can so much as move, a spined tentacle raises the hybrid into the air over a charnel maw. The creature lets out one last pitiful groan as it is dropped into the fanged mouth. Your stomach turns when you hear its shell crack between the abomination’s powerful jaws. A low, satisfied rumble follows as the Thing sinks beneath the bog."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Thing roars in pain as it flails its many limbs. Shockwaves ripple through the soft, wet ground, reducing groves of trees to tinder. You scramble for purchase as two sharp pops punctuate the air. The monstrous creature gurgles as its deflating air bladders struggle to buoy it up. Its last roar is cut short as the Thing sinks below the fetid marsh."
