msgid "A key always enters play attached to its bearer (as marked in the Campaign Log). At the start of each scenario, each investigator who is the bearer of 1 or more keys attaches those keys to their investigator card.

msgid "While a key is attached to an investigator, that investigator may trigger its shift ability during any player window as a [fast] ability. This is called “shifting” the key.

"When a scenario includes one or more concealed enemies, investigators are instructed to set aside several concealed mini-cards. These mini-cards are double-sided.

"When an investigator draws an enemy with the concealed X keyword (or is instructed to resolve an enemy’s concealed keyword), they spawn that enemy into a game area above the agenda deck, not at any location. This area is called “the shadows,” and represents enemies the investigators know exist somewhere on the map, but are unsure where. Then, that investigator takes the set-aside concealed mini-card that matches that enemy, along with X decoys (where X is defined by that enemy’s concealed X value), shuffles them facedown, and puts them into play distributed as evenly as possible among each location in play, starting with the locations nearest to them. Then, at each of those locations that already had 1 or more concealed mini-cards, they shuffle each of them facedown as well.\n"

Then, she takes the set-aside Coterie Agent (A) mini-card, along with 2 decoys, shuffles them facedown, and places one at each of the three locations nearest to her. Then, if any of those locations already had 1 or more concealed mini-cards, she would shuffle each concealed mini-card at those locations, as well.</i>"

msgid "Enemies in the shadows cannot be damaged or leave play via player card effects."

msgid "While in play, concealed mini-cards represent the possible location of an enemy in the shadows. In order to deal with such an enemy, its true location must first be discovered by exposing its mini-card. This can be done via one of three methods: fighting, evading, or investigating."
msgstr ""

msgid "Concealed mini-cards are not enemies and cannot be engaged like enemies. However, any investigator at the same location as a concealed mini-card may attempt to expose it by successfully attacking it or evading it (as if it were an engaged enemy), or by successfully investigating its location. The difficulty to successfully attack or evade a concealed mini-card is equal to the shroud value of its location."

msgid "An investigator may also use a card effect that automatically evades an enemy, deals damage to an enemy, or discovers a clue at a location in order to instead expose a concealed mini-card."

msgid "If an investigator chooses to expose a concealed mini-card, that effect replaces the standard effects of the action or ability that exposed it. <i>(i.e., if an enemy’s mini-card is exposed by evasion or damage, the matching enemy is not evaded, nor does it take damage.

That mini-card is a decoy, and is set aside without effect. (2) Next, they move to the connecting location with the other concealed mini-card and attempt to expose it using an evade action. They succeed and flip the mini-card over… revealing the Coterie Assassin’s mini-card! (3) The Coterie Assassin’s mini-card is set aside, and the Coterie Assassin in the shadows is moved to Kymani’s location, engaging them. Because there is another enemy in the shadows, they do not remove any of the other concealed mini-cards from play.</i>"
