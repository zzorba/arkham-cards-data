"Another obstacle blocks your passage through Wonderland, this time in the form of a vast brick wall.  It stretches towards the horizon in either direction, making you doubt if a way around it exists.  Climbing doesn't seem to be an option either, as it stands at the height of a house without any possible footholds.  Exasperated, you begin walking its length in hopes of finding any kind of door or passage through.\n"
"Some distance down the wall, you spot a rotund figure perched atop it.  As you draw close, the silhouette of an egg with legs grows clearer.  You doubt your own eyes for a moment, but who else could it possibly be but Humpty Dumpty from the old nursery rhyme?  He sits atop the wall with his eyes closed and his fist on his chin (or at least the part of his body that passes for his chin) in deep thought.  You call up to him, but he hisses down at you.\n"
"\"Don't speak!  Move away!  Or you might bring the end about quicker!\" Humpty spits at you, trying to remain oblivious to you.  You insist in confusion, and finally he looks down at you with a mixture of annoyance and dread.  \"Now you've done it!  I was safe while I was deep in ponderance!\"  You question whether the word means what he thinks, but he shakes his head - or himself, rather.  \"When I use a word, it means precisely what I wish it to mean!  Otherwise, what good would it be?\"  You decide not to press him on that point and ask again about the end he mentioned earlier.\n"
"\"The end, don't you see?  The others may not see it, but surely you can.  I can recognize one of Alice's ilk when I see one, not from Wonderland at all.  You know as well as I that this land is but a dream, and I, drawn from a sad and dismal tale, am doomed to a gravitic fate!\"  You begin to see Humpty's worries.  Sat on a wall, had a great fall, couldn't be put back together again.  You assert that the children's story and his existence are two separate things, but his expression only grows darker.  \"It's no use!  The printed word is my fate, and that's the end of it.  It's simply my means to an end, and always has been.\"  Humpty's stare grows unfocused, and he begins to wobble atop the wall."

msgid "\"Accept?!\" Humpty scoffs, steadying himself to continue his tirade.  \"Why I've a good mind to come down there and show you precisely why I should accept it!\"  He begins to clamber down the wall, more sliding than climbing and slipping at several points, but he reaches the ground unscathed.  Humpty wags a finger up at you as he continues ranting.  \"Simply don't accept it, what an utterly intangible thought!  What reason should I have to believe that I should survive a fall from up-\" he points up to his former perch and pauses in thought, \"-up there.  Down to... here?\"  Humpty takes a quick stock of his surroundings and kneads the grass beneath his shoes as the truth dawns on him.  \"I'm... vivacious!  Undisturbed!  There was no great fall or failure to repurpose my pieces!\"  He leaps into the air and clicks his heels in joy as you simply stand by and watch, bemused.  Humpty revels for a few moments longer before he grabs your hand and shakes it vigorously.  \"Well met indeed, then!  You've assuredly granted me a new perspective.  Why, I might do a great many other things now that I've regained myself!\"  You tell Humpty to take it easy for a while, not wanting to turn him into a daredevil.  His fate is his own, but an egg's still an egg."

msgid "\"Fussing?!\" Humpty screeches, \"it is factually reasonable to fear doom from this height!  Suppose I wobble further like this!\" he rocks himself from side to side to prove his point, making himself more unsteady as he does so.  \"Or back to forward like so!\"  He tilts out over the wall and back as he further demonstrates his fear.  You try to get Humpty to stop his hyperbole, but he doesn't listen at all.  \"It's vital for the both of us that you understand the peril I could find myself in!  And if you don't believe me, then-\" Humpty stops mid-sentence as he realizes his wild rocking has upset his balance completely.  He claws at the bricks in a moment of panic, but it's too late to stop from careening over the edge.  You try to help break his fall, but his wild earlier motions send him on a strange trajectory.  Humpty's wail of terror ends abruptly as his body crashes onto the ground, shattering like a vase.  You shake your head at the egg's shortsightedness and look over his remains.  It would be an impossible task fitting him back together, and whether or not that would actually revive him is anyone's guess.  There isn't much you can do now but press on and hope that Wonderland's other inhabitants will be more open to reason."

"With the matter of Humpty Dumpty behind you, the problem of the wall remains.  The wall might very well be infinite, if Alice's dreams are, and without so much as a tree to use in scaling the wall, you'll have to double back and find another way.  Before you can act, however, the sound of scraping bricks meets your ears.  You scan the wall for the source of the sound, but you can't pinpoint it.  Upon closer inspection, the entire wall seems to be trembling slightly.  A tremendous rumbling begins to sound through the bricks, and you take several steps backward, looking down to either end of the wall.  The top layer of the wall rises like a wave, and a ripple of displaced masonry works down from either end, looking to meet up at your spot.  You leap backward even further as the bricks collide with a crash, and a cloud of powdered mortar obscures your vision.\n"
"The dust settles quickly in the silence of the aftermath, and the wall before you has been cracked at the top, with loose bricks now forming a rough ramp upward.  Once again, you can only attribute such swift and dramatic assistance as Alice's influence on her own dreams, helping to guide you along.  With another obstacle eliminated, you climb the mound of debris and easily pass through the fissure in the brick wall."
