"It's difficult to judge how far you've trekked through Wonderland.  Milestones and landmarks are few and far between, which makes the finding of an actual road all the more welcome.  A simple dirt lane cuts a surprisingly direct path through the countryside.  You follow it with anticipation building inside you as the dusty earth transitions to loose gravel and finally orderly cobblestones.  You scarcely have time to hope for any sort of relief before you arrive at the outskirts of a derelict village.\n"
"It's clear that Gurathnaka's minions have ripped this town apart.  Each stone wall bears the same deep gouges that you have seen from other sites of their attacks.  You watch each darkened corner of the village as you walk further into its heart.  As you near the center of the small town, the sounds of commotion grow steadily louder.  You peer around a corner cautiously and gawk at the sight coming from the village square.\n"
"A lion and a unicorn, standing on two legs each and back to back, are fending off an advancing crowd of shadowy beasts.  You watch in amazement for several moments as the two expertly combat the dark creatures.  However, as the din of combat begins to fade to ambiance, you begin to catch smatterings of conversation from the pair of animals.\n"
"\"You're slacking!  Positively slacking against these fiends!\" the Unicorn calls out from amid the melee, \"you're going to make us miss the refreshments!\"\n"
"\"Your complaining slows you!\" the Lion retorts with a growl, \"I fight twice as hard as you ever could!\"  The two continue their brawl, glancing with irritation at each other whenever they can spare a glance.  You consider that the two may have once been rivals before being forced into fighting the shadows together.  With each passing second, each works to deliberately put the other at a disadvantage.  Their wider swings clip each other, their poor footing trips the other, and their exchanges grow more and more volatile.  At the rate that they're destroying their own fighting chances, you have only a small window to act."

"You decide that the risk of facing down another horde of shadows is worth gaining a few new allies.  You rush out from the building and begin pummeling the closest of Gurathnaka's minions.  The Lion and the Unicorn regard you strangely, but allow you to join them in standing back to back against the shadows.  You bark orders at them to shape up and focus on their foes, and while the rivals don't respond verbally, they obey to keep the fight going.\n"
"You've never seen this many of the shadows attacking the same spot at once.  Their relentless assault doesn't give you an opportunity to consider anything but staying alive, however.  Monster after monster hurl themselves at you, clawing and biting savagely, but repelled time and time again.  For minutes, the melee drags on until at last the flow of enemies evaporates.  You stand raggedly, as do the Lion and the Unicorn, utterly exhausted and not a bit bruised from the attacks.\n"
"\"Plum cake!\" the Lion calls out, and the Unicorn echoes his strange demand, \"this sort of fight deserves a king's refreshment!\"  You don't have anything to offer the duo, though you do pose them several questions.\n"
"\"You may have fought well, but don't think you're anywhere near our mark!\" the Unicorn brags down to you, \"the crown must go to one of us two - me to be precise.\"  The Lion scoffs and attempts to rebuff the claim, but you ignore his grumbling.  You explain that whatever crown they're fighting for is nowhere to be found.\n"
"\"The blackguards!\" the Lion snorts, \"stolen our - my - crown while they ruined our sport!\"  The Unicorn stamps its hooves in half agreement, calling for the crown.  \"We'll retake the crown and then fight for it once again!  See that we don't!\"  You decide not to raise any further objections as long as they've settled on working together against the shadows.  The less you have to reason with these mad animals, the better a time you'll have."

"You hesitate to leap into danger of this caliber with only a slight chance of gaining anything.  You decide to keep hidden and turn your eyes from the fray.  The fighters' sounds of pain and anger are soon drowned by the flood of shadows, and silence returns to the desolate town.  You wait until the shadows fade back into the alleyways before you begin to make your way back out of the village.\n"
"You've scarcely traveled three steps before you hear a warped roar and whinny behind you.  The Lion and the Unicorn, oozing blood and tinged by the shadows, look to you with crazed expressions.  \"Look there!\" the Unicorn cries with a hint of a laugh, \"the thief stands before us in so bold a fashion!\"\n"
"\"Folly!  Folly and madness to stand so boldly!\" the Lion echoes.  You can't imagine what they'd call you a thief for, but with appearances like that, they're clearly beyond reason.  The pair of corrupted beasts lunge forward at you, and you take flight.  Down the twisting alleys of the town they chase you, each time vanishing into dead ends and reappearing from stone walls.  You begin to panic as you try to evade the violent duelists, watching each building with a growing fear.  At last a gap in the streets appears and you sprint out of the small village, still looking over your shoulder and at each piece of terrain as though the Lion and the Unicorn may leap out at you at any moment."

msgid "Well clear of the abandoned village, you try to take your bearings.  As before, it's difficult to find any landmarks amid the wide open fields of Wonderland.  The ripples of the wind through the tall grass give the appearance of waves of water, until strangely, you spot a hint of blue amid the pale green.  A river begins to wind its way toward you, as if being carved into the land as it traverses the fields.  This cannot be another of Wonderland's random occurrences.  Your thoughts return to Alice as you change course to follow the riverbank trail, wondering if her influence could create such a stream just like that."
