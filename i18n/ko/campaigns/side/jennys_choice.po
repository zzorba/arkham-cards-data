"Several months ago, lzzie's letters to you had become increasingly infrequent and then stopped altogether. Growing worried, you decided to make a trip to Arkham, Massachusetts, to investigate. After arriving, you had followed your instincts, which led you to a case of multiple missing persons, a harvest festival depicting the fertility deity known as the Green Man, and a ritual murder that summoned something so nightmarish that you still see it when you close your eyes. All of the events were seemingly connected to some entity named Shub-Niggurath.\n"
"Although the event resulted in the tragic loss of some lives, lzzie was not one of them. She had disappeared in the final moments, pursued or dragged off by the last remaining cult members.\n"
"It has taken every resource you had left, but at long last you have stumbled upon some evidence-evidence that suggests that lzzie may still be in trouble. You finally know exactly where they have taken her.\n"
"There ain't nothing that's gonna stop you from finding lzzie now. Those Green Men goons won't know what hit 'em."

"\"Izzie! Isabelle! Wake up! I'm here, I'm here! I need you, Izzie. Come back to me!\"\n"
" Izzie's face grimaces with strain as she fights whatever hex has her insensate. At last, she opens her eyes with a shocked expression on her face.  \"Jenny!\"\n"
"\"Not now lzzie, there's some trouble and this canceled stamp is trying something funny.\"\n"
"You turn around, twin .45s at the ready, but Mrs. Olmstead has vanished. With the ritual interrupted, the music has finally stopped, and the cathedral has grown silent. It's time to get of here, with your sister, and find a place that's got some jazz to get this terrible tune out of your head."
msgstr ""

msgid "You'll never know how the song ends, and it will likely haunt your dreams and waking thoughts for the rest of your living days. Izzie's violin clatters to the floor. The amphitheatre grows quiet. Your friends don't know what to say. You are glad they say nothing. It's over. You were too late. But she is at least at peace. You're sorry you can't say the same for yourself. You spend the next hour crawling through the wreckage of the cathedral that the vibrations from Izzie's-no, the Green Man's-song left in its wake. All you can do is move forward. Maybe next time, for the next girl, you'll get there in time. Maybe."

"You awake surrounded by the devastated cathedral. There is nothing left where Izzie once was. The forest glade looks as if a tornado had swept through the area. You are lucky you were not crushed by the rubble as the cathedral collapsed.\n"
"Izzie is gone for good. Nothing could bring her back from that. Her last moments trapped in torment, bound to the Green Man. The perfect vessel not so perfect in the end, I suppose. But that light, that green light, what did it mean?\n"
"You close your eyes. All you see is green."

"You are not sure you are making the right decision. What else can you do? It's Izzie-the little girl you always used to warn to leave you alone, when all she ever did was look up to you. And then one day, she did leave you alone. This is your fault. You knew it might come to this. How can you fight what you can't even see?\n"
"The Heralds that you had bribed earlier see to the care of Izzie as she is slowly awakened from her trance. Mrs. Olmstead takes your hand and leads you to the center of the amphiteatre. Your friends move to stop you, but you shake your head, and they understand. It is your choice. You feel a pressure; the pitch of a staccato of measure leaves you reeling. You cannot even focus on the god forsaken music. The last thing that you think is that they probably never needed the music anyway.\n"
"Isabelle wakes up hours later. She does not remember how she got to this place. A strange man in a green cloak explains that Jenny took your place in the ritual.\n"
"You don't understand why she would do that, but her friends tell you it is true. What happened after, they refuse to say. Some things we are better off not knowing. You're not sure what to do. You consider what Jenny would do. And the answer comes to you, she'd do what she could."

"Mrs. Olmstead sways to the piping as if she does not even notice the degree of her wounds at first. Then her eyes start to dim, and she looks at you sadly, \"My life is but one. It is my master's loss that is truly the tragedy. The vessel -look- it withers and dies.\" Mrs. Olmstead falters and abruptly leans into the wall. \"The vessel cannot be sustained without my sorcery as the anchor. You've doomed her.\" She coughs, then trips, and falls lifeless to the floor.\n"
"You rush to Izzie's side, but it is too late. Mrs. Olmstead was not lying. Your sister no longer suffers, and you had not known any better. Bitterly, you wonder what you could have done differently. Which of your many decisions has led you down this path?\n"
"It is weeks before you realize that the Green Man cult has been eradicated. That, in the end, it was a decision made for the greater good. Maybe Izzie would have wanted it this way. You'll never get to ask."
