msgid "Scenario IV: The Heart of Madness"
msgstr "시나리오 IV: 광기의 심장부"

msgid "The next day, you plumb deeper into the caverns and pits beneath the icy crust of Antarctica. You pass under great archways of obsidian and primordial slate, through ornately-carven corridors and enormous, many-pillared halls, down into unknowable and unfathomable depths."

msgid "The team's leader pulls the group together for one last round of encouragement as you leave the relative safety of the surface behind. \"All right, everyone. I know these conditions are… not ideal,\" Dr. Kensler begins. \"But we are close. So very, very close. To getting answers. To making all of this effort, all of this madness worth something. Just a little further, and we will learn the truth.\" She sighs. \"This has been rough. On all of us. But please, bear with me a little while longer. I promise you, it will be worth it.\" Despite the otherwise grim mood, there is a murmuring of agreement among the survivors. You're not about to back down now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Step by step, you and the survivors trek further down the incline. The mood of your party is grim and hopeless. You feel as though there is no coming back from this place. You will likely meet your end here. The weight of this burdensome thought makes each of your steps heavy."

msgid "<i>If the investigators scouted the forked passage:</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Eventually, you come to a familiar fork in the cavern, the same passage you and Ellsworth scouted the previous night. You explain to the others that you felt air circulating through the leftmost passage the previous night, and that it is therefore unlikely to be a dead end. The others give a nod of agreement, and together you venture into what you believe is the correct passage."
msgstr ""

msgid "After setup, before the next game begins, the lead investigator may look at the revealed side of any two Ancient Facility locations in play."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eventually, you come to a fork in the cavern. To your left, the tunnel forks into a smaller, icy path with a steeper and more dangerous incline. To your right, the ramp simply continues onward without much change. With no other information to go off, you choose the larger of the two paths. It continues to fork along the way, taking you down a circuitous, lengthy route. You end up deeper within the caverns, though you're no longer sure how to get back…"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hours pass. Eventually, the passage seems to open into a larger corridor of worked stone, with one final archway marking the end of the titanic ramp you have been descending. Five unfamiliar glyphs adorn the archway, their meaning incomprehensible. The path on the other side seems more like a vast underground subway tunnel than a natural cavern formation - all smooth, angular stone punctuated by alien markings and covered faintly in putrid, multicolored ichor."
msgstr ""

msgid "\"The creatures-they made this place,\" Danforth reasons as you pass beneath the final archway. \"It is just as I suspected the last time I was here. This is no natural part of Antarctica. It is all connected. This is the true heart of their civilization.\" You ask Danforth what he means—what did you explore yesterday, if not their city? \"It was but the tip of the iceberg, if you will pardon the expression,\" he states. \"Like the highest story of a skyscraper. But the ice and snow buried the rest. We could not tell.\" You ask how far down he believes the city descends. \"From what we saw of their history?\" He meets your gaze, sweat beading down his forehead. With all seriousness, he replies, \"to the very bottom of the ocean.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "As you cross under the final archway, you begin to question the truth of this place. You thought it to be a natural cavern at first, but now it is clear the Elder Things—or some other primeval, alien force—had a hand in its design . Or are you going about this all wrong? Perhaps they are not the ones cast from afar, intruders upon your home. Perhaps Antarctica—indeed, the Earth—was never meant for you, or any of your kind. The truth of humanity's insignificance rattles you to your core."

msgid "If Miasmic Crystal is listed under \"Supplies Recovered\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Your backpack begins to glow once you enter this region of worked, carven stone. In apanic, you toss the pack off your shoulder and back away from it. Once a minute has passed without any change, you approach and carefully open it to reveal the strange otherworldly crystal you discovered shortly after the plane crash. It seems to be responding to this place, a bright glow and a droning hum emanating from within. It doesn't seem to be dangerous, so you tie the crystal around your waist and use its light to guide you onward."
msgstr ""

msgid "The darkness beyond is like the abyss at the bottom of the ocean. Your torches and lanterns reach only a few feet ahead before their light is swallowed by black. Coupled with the intense pressure and biting cold, you feel as though the weight of the entire world looms over you. It is a journey of unparalleled dread."

"Finally, at the end of this vast chamber, you come to a nexus within the dormant structure: a scaled gateway of immense size, emblazoned with the same five glyphs, along with a series of interlocking mechanisms. Channels and grooves mark a path from the door's surface back to each of the five glyphs.\n"
"Beyond the gate, you hear a familiar churning, the bubbling and frothing of miasma, and the seething of hateful mist. \"It is beyond this door,\" one of your party says, and you cannot help but agree. You can feel its presence or rather, you have felt its presence all along, ever since you set foot on Antarctica, only now its call is impossible to ignore. It whispers faintly to you. Along the surface of your mind, visions play out. Your wildest dreams and most joyful moments. Your darkest desires and hardest struggles. It is a mirage. The mirage. Sealed behind this door, likely for eons upon end, watched over, or perhaps even harnessed, by those who came before you. But it is escaping, bit by bit. The creatures you have encountered and fought are evidence enough of that. The Elder Things know it is breaking free, too. They built this place, and now it is abandoned…"
