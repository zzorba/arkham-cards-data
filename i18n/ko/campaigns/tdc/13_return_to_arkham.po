msgid "Your sleep on the voyage home is fraught with nightmares. Upon returning to Arkham, you and the others bring the expedition's findings back to an elated Tillinghast. As you relay the events of the expedition to the collector, he turns each piece in hand, marveling at the ancient technology. \"You've done all I asked and more,\" he grins. \"Consider your debts annulled. And, of course, I'm more than happy to honor our original agreement.\""

msgid "Your sleep on the voyage home is fraught with nightmares. Upon returning to Arkham, you and the others lay your few findings before Tillinghast. The antiquarian is furious when he sees you returned empty handed until Andy lays the obsidian slab he found in R'lyeh on his desk. Randall surveys it with a cold stare. \"I suppose this isâ€¦ adequate. Consider your debts annulled. And, despite the fact that you have brought almost <i>nothing</i> of value, I am obliged to honor our original agreement.\""

msgid "Upon returning, you are hailed as a prophet amongst your fellow believers. The dreams that led you to R'lyeh are the same visions shared by your brothers and sisters in the faith. Now, more and more of them are singing in strange tongues and stitching patchwork cloaks. Your purpose in traveling to R'lyeh, in witnessing those lost pilgrims, was not to shake your faith, but to restore it. You have glimpsed the face of the ancients. Only you are fit to lead your people out of darkness and into the light. You need only continue to follow your path with the same unshakeable devotion that delivered you from R'lyeh."

"You stand on a bridge overlooking the Miskatonic River, watching the waters below dance and glimmer. Upon returning, you felt something was different. Something changed. Your fellow believers say that outsiders wearing patchwork cloaks recently arrived, uttering miraculous prophecies and enticing promises. Now your place of worship is covered in profane symbols: a hand with a flaming eye; a chalice overflowing with blood. What you once thought holy was ruined.\n"
"Now, as you stand overlooking the water, you hold your token of faith in one hand. You cannot help but feel that you were led astray. Taking a deep breath, you throw the token into the water below. As it sinks, you feel some part of yourself sink with it. There is no turning back now."

You skimmed enough ancient knick knacks and research notes to satisfy both Tillinghast and that old bat Sanford. With the payout from each of them, you have enough cash to go wherever you want, to be whomever you want to be. It sounds like Sanford and his lackeys are going under anyway."

msgid "You leaf through Randall's reward for all your efforts: a tattered stack of Blavatsky and Crowley books. They might satisfy some fledgling seer, but not you. The fact that he offered them as a reward is almost insulting. Closing the book, you hear a faint whisper of the same voices you heard in R'lyeh. Your nightmares were not heralds of destruction: they were warnings from vagrant spirits. The coming calamity may be unavoidable, they tell you, but that doesn't mean you can't fight it."

Your debt was forgiven, but there is still the matter of your room and board to settle. \"Just a few more months, and we can finally settle up,\" he cooed. Rather than answer, you grabbed your reward and walked out. It was never about the money. He wanted to keep you on retainer. He'll surely be after you for the money eventually, but that doesn't matter now. You never needed him in the first place. Home is what you make it, not where you make it, there's nothing Tillinghast can do to take that from you now."

It's an entirely reasonable request. And after all, he's the only reason you're not living on the streets.\n"
"Walking past Ma's Boarding House, you catch the scent of a home-cooked meal: fresh-baked bread, green beans, and sliced ham. Your stomach rumbles. You feel an old yearning, something more than hunger. Just a lttle more work, and Tillinghast will help you get your feet under you. Someday soon, you'll have a home of your own."

"Barely a week after returning, you receive a request from Miskatonic University to formally present your findings. The word 'tenure' has reached your ears more than once. Despite the incredible acclaim your studies have brought you, the prestige feels empty. The academic song and dance is little more than shadowplay. And it is nothing compared to the horrific truths you learned in R'lyeh. On more than one occasion, you find yourself awake in the dark, breathing heavily, with memories of a time and a world not your own. You know the horrible truth: Humanity is nothing more than a weak echo of far greater civilizations.\n"

Your findings were received as mere fantasy, and the ancient writings you translated were dismissed out of hand. You would be lucky to teach children, let alone lecture in the grand halls of a university. You pause your reading to look at a strange codex scrawled in the margins of your book, strangely familiar. For a moment, you feel a famihar pang of curiosity, the same as you felt in R'lyeh.\n"
