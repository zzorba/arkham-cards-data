The leftmost card is referred to as the Active card.  It is considered to be in play and its effects active.  The other faceup card is the Next card.  This card is visible, but it is not considered to be in play, and its effects are not active."

"The meeting adjourns and you immediately begin preparations for the difficult expedition.  Dorothy walks alongside you to tell you as much about the Nome Kingdom as she knows.  \"Ruggedo used to be the Nome King, back when we first went there to free the royal family of Ev, but his ol' steward Kaliko is Nome King now.  Though I can't reckon if he's in charge now that Ruggedo is back and filled up with the Colour's power.  But if they still act like Nomes at all, then I think we have a secret weapon.\"  Dorothy gives you a weary but confident look, and leads you to the palace gardens where you find a large yellow hen milling about, surrounded by her chicks.  \"Billina!\" Dorothy calls out, \"we've got to go to the Nome Kingdom again.  Do you think you can supply us?\"\n"
"The hen gives an irritated cluck, not bothering to look up from her chicks.  \"Isn't this Colour enough of a problem without the Nomes?  But yes, I can spare some eggs for the journey.  I'm surprised I'm still laying eggs at all with this uneasy air around us.\"  You look to Dorothy for context, but Billina continues with the same disgruntled tone.  \"Nomes are terrified of eggs.  Ozma said that eggs turn them mortal, but I haven't known a Nome long enough to know if it works.\"  The Nomes' inherent fear may or may not be strong enough to overcome the influence and control of the Colour, but in either case, you must use every advantage to its fullest.  You return to your preparations, wondering how best to proceed into a hostile country deep underground."

msgid "Prisoner though he is, Guph has no qualms about sharing details about the tunnel and its surrounding area.  His early departure from the kingdom gives you no indication of how the caverns have been affected by the Colour, but something is better than nothing it all."

msgid "Unfamiliar Territory"

msgid "Ozma's magic painting can only show people, not general places, and unfortunately cannot help scout.  All you can do is trust your instincts and be cautious in the approach.  Enemies will be abundant in the Nome Kingdom, both soldiers of the kingdom and maddened thralls of the Colour."

msgid "Beaten back by the fierce resistance of the Colour and the infected Nomes, you trudge slowly back through the tunnel toward Oz.  Your companions try to offer encouragement and begin to formulate plans of a second attack when a strong rumbling begins to shake the tunnel.  You brace yourself against the wall for the tremor to pass, but find another cause for concern.  The ambient glow of the Colour dims, leaving you in near pitch darkness."

msgid "Ruggedo cracks one eye open as you stand above him.  His body is growing brittle and ashen, and beginning to distort beyond a humanoid form.  \"You... can fight the Colour...\" he rasps, trying but failing to reach out toward you, \"Your mind... and your body... must be strong... Maybe even... strong enough... to avenge me...\" Ruggedo's face gives the suggestion of a proud smile before his features dissolve away.  The Nome's body crumbles and spills like a sand castle in the wind, leaving only a featureless pile.  Silence briefly dominates the throne room before motion stirs from beside the golden gong.  Kaliko -- the Nome King once again -- pushes himself to his feet with a dazed expression.  \"The maddening thing... it's gone!  Did you... destroy it?\"  You shake your head, looking about the audience chamber warily.  This was a blow against the Colour, but you'd be a fool to think it was over already."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ruggedo struggles upward with a pained groan.  The Nome is pale and haggard, and visibly straining to stay conscious, but undoubtedly alive.  He sits panting and shivering for nearly a minute before he can summon the strength to speak.  \"Is it gone...?  What happened...?\"  You can only guess the trauma that Ruggedo has suffered since he touched the meteor, so it's clear that now is not the time for a full explanation.  You assure him that he is free from the Colour, but tell him that the fight is far from over.  Ruggedo shakes his head weakly.  \"Of course not... I felt the hunger in that being... its desire to feed and drain... and multiply...\"  The throne room shakes violently, but to your astonishment, the vibrant hues suddenly drain away, leaving you in dim light.  The Nome steadies himself while Kaliko -- the reigning Nome King -- slowly rises from beside the gong.  Ruggedo is a valuable firsthand witness to the Colour, so you hoist the weakened Nome out of the throne for the trip back to Oz.  Kaliko is dazed and distant, but you assure him as best as possible that the Nomes are free from the Colour for now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Though the unearthly Colour fades from the stone halls of the Nome Kingdom, the rock grinds and rumbles with decreasing stability.  The Colour is on the move once more, and you have a pretty good idea where it's headed.  It used the Nomes to protect itself, like the parasite it is, but your incursion has threatened it.  The Colour will retaliate to ensure that you and the others do not keep it from infecting the world."
