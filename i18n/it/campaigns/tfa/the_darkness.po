msgid "You stir awake, lying facedown on the cold, hard stone of the cavern. You are bruised and battered but, somehow, alive. It takes several minutes before you regain enough of your strength to stand. You are absolutely and hopelessly lost within the impossibly vast caverns, enveloped by pitch-black darkness. Have you survived all this way only to perish here, lost to all humanity?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The grim, blood-red caverns and resentful cities of Yoth hold no candle to the terrifying depths that lie below them. You are in the deepest level of this subterranean realm now: the caverns Ichtaca referred to as “N’kai.” Nothing could have prepared you for the impervious murk that surrounds you on all sides, an inky darkness that none of your light sources can penetrate. You grope around in the darkness until you feel the jagged wall of the cavern and begin to follow it aimlessly, desperately hoping to find the way forward. A grim realization dawns on you: Even should you complete your task, you will surely never find a way back to the surface. The overwhelming darkness of the cavern fills you with a dread you have never before experienced. You cannot see your hands as you grope about in the darkness, nor can you tell if you are in a narrow tunnel or a vast open space. The ground beside you could extend for miles or abruptly become a bottomless cavern, and you would not be able to tell the difference unless you stepped there. Hours pass as you stumble in the dark, slowly, carefully, nervously. Every step could be your last."

msgid "Without Alejandro or Ichtaca to distract you, you find yourself studying the relic intently. Both of your “guides” have only fed you lies. They hid the relic’s true nature from you, manipulating you in an attempt to bring the relic to this very place. After your experience with the Great Race of Yith, you think you understand why. The technology behind the device’s design is far beyond what any human could accomplish, but quite possible for the Yithians. You even recognize some elements of the relic’s construction from the technology in Pnakotus. Somehow, it ended up in the hands of the Eztli, who defended it with care from all manner of creatures. Creatures that predate humanity. Creatures who wished to use it to turn back time. And now that the relic is in your possession, only you can stop this from occurring."
