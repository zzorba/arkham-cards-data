"It has taken months of preparation, but you are finally ready to unveil your latest work to the world. Gathering financial investments was your first task, of course. That hadn’t taken too long given the connections you’d made during your stay in Paris. You have been assured that the cast assembled is the finest that money could afford, but still you strive to make everything perfect. It must be perfect. The story must be told, so that the world knows. You’ve heard the troupe whisper behind your back: the remarks about your bizarre passion, the concern about your piercing yellow eyes. It matters not to you. All you care about is the performance. The pronunciation of the words. The melody of Cassilda’s song. The design of the Stranger’s mask.\n"
"This would be the greatest performance of <u>The King in Yellow</u> ever."
