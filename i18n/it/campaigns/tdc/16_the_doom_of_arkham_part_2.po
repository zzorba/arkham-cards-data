msgid "You and the others watch helplessly as Cthulhu levels the rest of Rivertown. Black water floods the streets and ruins in his wake. \"Randall's behind this. I don't know how or why, but I think he wanted us to wake that thing up!\" says Ruby. Hungry flames begin to lick at the wreckage as ruptured gas lines ignite, illuminating the legions of Cthulhu's spawn as they descend on the city. \"If that's true, then we had better find a way to stop it,\" Andy says. They look to you for direction."

msgid "\"I like how you think,\" Inspector Legrasse says as he loads his gun with a satisfying click. Together, you form a plan to fend off the ancient menace. Ruby suggests that some of you take to the rooftops, while Legrasse phones in some connections with the Arkham police. If you stand together, you may be able to draw Cthulhu's tre away from Arkham itself. \"This is the worst idea I've ever heard, but I don't think we have any other choice,\" Ruby says. You see a glimmer of something—is it fear?—in her eyesin her eyes. You have no other choice but to fight."

"Andy beckons you all into a deserted diner as the waters continue to rise. \"This isn't my field of expertise,\" he says, laying a stack of loose papers on a table. \"But I've been translating the glyphs from R'lyeh, and I think we might be able to stop this with, uhm... well, a ritual.\" Ruby waves Inspector Legrasse's objections aside as Andy outlines a \"ritual of returning\" he discovered in the ancient courts of R'lyeh. By using pieces of the ancient city of R'lyeh, you may be able to seal the ancient one away.\n"
"\"The glyphs I translated seemed to imply that Cthulhu and his, er, children are bound to R'lyeh itself—\" he lays out a map of Arkham. \"If we place these artifacts around the city like so, I can recite the ritual and banish him. However, I'll need you all to draw his attention, keep his eyes on you, while I prepare.\" Andy holds up one of the artifacts you recovered from Randall, turning it over in his hand. It glows with an unnatural light.\n"
"\"I'll head to the Arkham police department,\" says Inspector Legrasse. \"I've got some connections there. We should be able to get some officers out on the streets to help the survivors.\" Ruby, who has been silent since Andy outlined the plan, crosses her arms. \"So you want us to rile up the thing that is literally destroying the city so you can recite some words and hide some relics.\" She takes a puff of her cigarette. \"What could go wrong?\""

"Cthulhu is represented on the map as a single enemy, but is made up of multiple enemy cards on the Cthulhu Board. Investigators that are engaged with Cthulhu <i>(Ancient Evil)</i> are also engaged with each card on the Cthulhu Board, as a single enemy.

"Cthulhu attacks each investigator at his location during the enemy phase using the combined damage and horror values of each [[Cthulhu]] enemy on the Cthulhu Board.

"After moving and attacking as normal during the enemy phase, Cthulhu performs additional actions via action cards from the Cthulhu deck.

"You struggle to rise as the ground rocks with another tremor. Mighty Cthulhu looks down on you with five dispassionate red eyes. You’ve dreamed this moment before. His hulking form blots out the stars above, shimmering with an otherworldly radiance. His rotten breath washes over you, stirring the water. For a moment, the clamor fades away as you meet the ancient one’s gaze. You feel him in your mind. There is no anger or rage, only cold indifference.\n"
"This is no reckoning, no judgment, no destruction. You and your kind are nothing more than an annoyance. The thick, squamous tentacles sprouting from Cthulhu’s face snake across the water, searching for you, for the things you and your kind took from him. You are powerless to resist. Why should you? Your fate and the fate of all your pathetic kind was written in the stars. Doom has come to Arkham."

For a moment, the clamor fades away as you meet the ancient one’s gaze. You feel him in your mind. There is no anger or rage, only cold indifference.\n"
"A shot rings out, followed by a dozen more. Behind you, from the nearby rooftops, and elsewhere in the vicinity, a volley of firearms and explosives pelt the ancient one’s sagging, fetid flesh. Inspector Legrasse shouts to his fellow officers, goading them to not let up. Great Cthulhu moans in pain as the sheer firepower chews through his armored flesh, flooding the streets with oily black blood. At long last, the tide seems to have turned in your favor. Cowed by the relentless assault, the ancient one turns back to the Miskatonic and lurches into the water, followed by a cadre of monstrous creatures.\n"
"You can feel the others hold their breath, waiting for some reprisal, but nothing comes. Then, a cheer breaks the silence, followed by dozens more. Arkham is safe… for now."

"Just as Cthulhu prepares to strike, the sigils on his body grow blindingly bright, and his limbs suddenly stiffen. Andy steps boldly out onto the street, stumbling through two more guttural stanzas. You and Ruby join him in reciting the chants as the ritual takes form. The ancient one roars again and falls prone, as if bound by invisible cords. A corona of eerie green and golden light cuts through the clouds, then peels back to reveal the night sky above. Nestled in the heart of an emerald and gold nebula is a bright, shining star.\n"
"The starlight intensifies. Before your eyes, the ancient one’s body twists and bends like a broken reflection. For just a moment, you see the spires of R’lyeh shimmering within the broken skyline of Arkham, looking both alien and familiar at once. With a final roar, Cthulhu disappears into the aether.\n"
"The corona of distant stars shrinks, then collapses with a thunderclap. In its wake is a dreadful silence.\n"
"You, Ruby, and Andy climb up to the roof of a nearby building and sit on the edge looking out at the ruined city. Rivertown and much of the Merchant District are entirely underwater, but most of Arkham remains intact. The three of you stare at the apocalyptics landscape as the storm clouds dissipate, bathing the city in pale moonlight. A lone siren blares across the swollen banks of the Miskatonic River. Andy stands up and extends a hand to you.\n"
