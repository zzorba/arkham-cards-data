msgstr ""

msgid "The scattered petals weave an inconstant route over the meadows and dales.  Your doubts are silenced as the flowers scatter in sight of an English country home, this one much more familiar.  The house is identical to the strange empty one that manifested in Arkham, though it is mirrored from what you remember.  You enter the house with a rush of excitement all the same, though uncertain what you will find inside.  Unlike the barren cottage you explored not so long ago, this house is filled with an uncomfortable clutter, and most of it levitating in random spots.  Finding a passage through the rooms proves more difficult than you expected, but at last you make your way to the strange parlor you briefly viewed through the mirror in Arkham.  A mirror also adorns this mantle, but the reflection is clouded by darkness, so much that you can barely make out your own image on it.  You place a hand on the mirror and press gently, and it bows like a rotted timber.  With few other options, you scale the fireplace and lean forward into the malleable mirror."

msgid "Out the Rabbit Hole"
msgstr ""

msgid "Following the map to the best of your abilities, you skirt the water's edge before cutting inland sharply.  Some short distance through the underbrush, your path reaches its terminus at a door embedded in a dirt hillock.  With no reason to hesitate, you open the door and squeeze inside.  The other side doesn't match up with your expectations at all, appearing as a labyrinth of thousands of doors down several branching corridors.  Wearily, you trudge forward, picking a path and proceeding methodically.  Your method soon gives way to madness, however, as the tight corridors open up and the walls seem to fall away from you, as if ejecting from reality altogether.  Gravity turns at random, and you struggle for footing as the long hallways funnel up and down.  As the dread of being forever lost begins to grow, a blinding light beams down at you from a narrow tunnel.  Your footing slips once again, and you begin falling - upward, it seems - toward it.  With scant seconds to brace, you ready yourself for the worst."

msgid "Arkham Unravelling"
msgstr ""

msgid "You emerge to a view of utter pandemonium.  From the damaged landmarks you can identify, you stand on the border between Arkham's Northside and Merchant District, though the former seems nothing more than a shadowy void.  From the fading twilight, you can only conclude that you've been gone from Arkham a matter of minutes, in spite of the days and nights you spent in Wonderland.  Your bewildered observation is interrupted by an unearthly noise, one that you know in your soul could only be made by one thing.  You turn toward the south side of the city to gaze at the shadowy form of Gurathnaka."

msgstr ""

msgid "\"Right this way, dear Alice.  They arrived not a moment ago.\"  From behind you, the familiar tone of the Cheshire Cat sounds, and you catch a glimpse of its fading smile as Alice herself staggers into view.  Her entire body shifts with relief at the sight of you in return.  \"You made it,\" she breathes with disbelief evident in her voice, \"I had hoped in earnest that you would, but in all my dreams-\" Alice winces in sudden pain and clutches her temples as Gurathnaka lets loose another unnatural roar across the shattered cityscape.  You help Alice steady herself and try to gauge her state of mind."

msgid "Absent Minded"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alice looks almost as if she is in shock.  Her eyes jitter slightly as she tries to focus her vision, and she moves as though in a trance.  \"I feel empty, in some strange way,\" Alice murmurs, \"but empty is preferable to dead.\"  You advise Alice not to strain herself, but she shakes her head forlornly as she looks to Gurathnaka across the river.  \"If not now, then when?\""

msgid "Half a Mind"

msgid "Alice takes several moments to compose herself before she looks to you, still a bit dazed.  \"I feel like a jigsaw puzzle, only halfway finished,\" she says with a hollow voice.  You suggest that Alice take some time to recover, but she refuses as her gaze drifts to Gurathnaka nearby.  \"Rest will only be of help once we've banished these terrible creatures.  I cannot sit idly by.\""

msgid "Presence of Mind"

msgid "Alice grits her teeth and her eyes snap open, conviction shining in them.  \"I feel the strain of those monsters on my mind, but I can bear it.\"  You try to help Alice to a more comfortable position to rest, but she places a hand on your shoulder reassuringly.  \"I shall be alright.  It is your city and our world that are most at risk right now.  After all that you have done on my behalf, I must help you however I can.\""

"In this scenario, Alice joins as an additional investigator, with some differences.  She does not count as an investigator for anything that uses the [per_investigator] multiplier.  Alice cannot take actions or gain resources, but draws during each upkeep phase until she has three cards in her hand.  Enemies cannot engage or attack Alice, and she does not draw an encounter card during the mythos phase.\n"

Gurathnaka's howling grows louder by the moment, and its minions slake their hunger on Arkham's architecture.  Injured and desperate, you rack your brain for something, anything that might yet save the world from the consuming shadows.  You look to Alice nearby, dazed and despairing as you are, and the grim thought occurs to you: Gurathnaka is using her dreams for this invasion.  Without Alice, the bridge between Arkham and Wonderland will immediately vanish, and the shadows with it.  The Cheshire Cat appears over you as the thought crosses your mind, and for the first time since you first laid eyes on it, the cat's grin falls to a grimace.  Your conscience undergoes a brief tug-of-war as your window of opportunity grows smaller."

"Alice collapses to the cobblestone streets without hardly any sound.  For an instant, time suspends, and a piercing cry from Gurathnaka rattles your very soul.  All at once, the world around you explodes into chaos, and you anchor yourself with whatever you can grab.  Your eyes squeeze shut and you yell in exertion and panic, until-\n"
"Your eyes open to a plaster roof lit by dim electric bulbs.  The scent of disinfectant lingers in the air, mixed with various unidentifiable chemicals.  Your head thrums and your entire body aches as you gather your bearings.  It soon becomes clear that you are lying in one of the many beds of St. Mary's Hospital, with bandages and casts wrapped tightly in place.  You lie in a daze until a nurse approaches you with a relaxed manner.  \"You're lucky to be alive!\" she encourages, inspecting some of your more superficial wounds, \"You must have been hit by a car or something even larger!\"  Questions flow out of your mouth, and the nurse responds without the least bit of concern.  She, and the rest of Arkham, doesn't recall anything about shadows or the upheaval of reality that you experienced.  By her account, you were discovered last night on the north end of the city and brought to the hospital for treatment.\n"
"Days pass until you are considered fit enough to leave the hospital of your own accord, and in that time, your dreams are plagued by visions of the shadows you fought.  Once cleared, you head directly toward Arkham Asylum and inquire frantically at the front desk about Alice's well-being.  The receptionist shakes his head and gives a resigned sigh.  \"You hadn't heard?  Miss Liddell passed away last week from complications of an epileptic fit.  Quite sad, but there wasn't much that could be done for the poor woman.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "After all that you and Alice have experienced, you simply can't bring yourself to kill her.  You shake your head and try to convince yourself that there must be another way.  This hesitation proves a costly one, however, and darkness washes over you, tearing you apart in an instant."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alice cannot resist the overwhelming advance of the shadows any longer.  A darkness the likes of which humanity has never known envelops Arkham and rapidly radiates outward.  Not even the stars shine down to light the world's end.  Gurathnaka feeds and grows, consuming buildings, then blocks, acres, counties, and ever larger meals.  Its hunger is bottomless, and its minions take after their master in fighting over the scraps of the most decadent feast of all.  Alice is kept alive throughout, and she holds out hope that somewhere, someone in the world can reverse this cataclysm, but in vain.  The great masters of magic and mystery have no time to prepare against Gurathnaka's hunger, and what little resistance they offer does as much good as a candle in a coffin.  Shadows eclipse the Earth, and only once every other molecule has been consumed do the fiends turn and devour Alice and her dreams.  And then, from the void of space, Gurathnaka and its minions return to the Dreamlands, licking their chops for the extinct taste of Earth and its people."

"Thrown to the ground from the force of the collapsing rift, you hunker down as a gale force whips around you.  Reality is reordering in a fantastic event, a complete reversal of the chaos that briefly collapsed the Northside and Downtown districts.  You dig your fingers into the gaps of the cobblestones, holding on for dear life amid the chaos.  From a nearby lamppost, Alice looks to you with uncertainty, and your eyes meet for a brief second before your vision is blinded with dazzling light.\n"
"When your eyes open next, you are greeted by the drab wallpaper and dim lighting of one of St. Mary's hospital rooms.  You sit up unsteadily, memories of your last moments of the battle hazy and scattered.  Your thoughts aren't fully sorted by the time a nurse enters with a small meal for you.  \"You're awake already!  Can you remember the last thing that happened to you?\"  You probe with general questions, trying to figure out just what has happened to Arkham, but the nurse isn't concerned in the least.  The shadows, the brief overlap with Wonderland, and the distorting chaos all fail to get any reaction out of her, other than a suspicious smile.  \"Now it's none of my business, but you really ought to be more careful if you're, erm… drinking anything stronger than water.  Next time, you could end up with more than a few bruises!  Don't worry, your secret is safe here.\"  You attempt to reason with the nurse, but she simply pats you on the hand and insists you eat.  Frustration takes a back seat to practicality, and you accept the food reluctantly, though you still insist that you be given a newspaper as soon as possible."
