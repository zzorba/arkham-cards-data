"Dr. Armitage suggested you track down his associate Dr. Francis Morgan. He’s not sure whether Dr. Morgan is in trouble, but he’s not particularly happy with his colleague’s present choice of company. He’s in the Clover Club, a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club’s exact location isn’t easy—you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the Downtown restaurants operates as the club’s front. That restaurant is La Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the theatre. You change into your Sunday best and make your way there.\n"
"In front of La Bella Luna stands a man in a pinstripe suit who sizes you up as you approach. “Enjoy yourselves,” he says with a snake-like grin as he holds open the restaurant’s front door."

msgid "You flee to the end of the block and pause to recover. Before you can catch your breath, the ground shakes with a thunderous crash. People emerge from their homes and storefronts to see what the ruckus is, and a crowd forms on the street. You head to the front of the crowd and are horrified to see the building from which you fled just minutes earlier reduced to rubble. There is no sign of Dr. Morgan anywhere."

msgid "“What in the world…?” Dr. Morgan finally breaks out of his daze as you make your way to safety. You ask him what he remembers, and he sputters and shakes his head. “It’s all a haze,” he explains, visibly exhausted. “I was having the run of my life! Perhaps I had one too many shots. But, those creatures—I haven’t seen anything like that since…” He trails off, and you can tell that his mind is racing. His eyes widen with realization and his face pales. “I may not be in the best shape, but I’ll help with your investigation. Whatever it takes.”"

"Although you were unable to find Dr. Morgan in the club, the man you rescued is grateful for your help. He introduces himself as Peter Clover, the owner of the establishment you’d just left. Despite the situation, he maintains an air of quiet professionalism. As you make your way towards the street, a well-polished Chrysler B-70 rolls up to you, and a gorgeous woman with long brown hair and narrow eyes exits. She is flanked by dangerous-looking men who slip their hands under their suit jackets when they see you. “Peter,” she says with a sigh of relief, “Good, you’re okay. I heard there was trouble?” She turns and glares at you with deadly eyes. “Who are they?”\n"
"Mr. Clover dusts off his vest, unworried. “Naomi, my dear, these are friends of mine. They…” he clears his throat. “They escorted me off the premises,” he explains after a short pause. “They have earned our gratitude.” The woman crosses her arms and takes a moment to size you up before giving you a smirk.\n"
"“Very well then. I must thank you for taking care of Peter. Run along now; we’ll handle things from here.” She nods to the goons flanking her and they walk past you toward the club’s rear entrance, pulling firearms out from underneath their coats. You’re not sure what ‘handling things’ means, but you’re pretty sure you don’t want to be here when the gunfire starts. You thank Naomi and Peter, and head off."

msgid "You are pulled from the debris by several firefighters, one of whom exclaims, “We’ve got a live one!” A few of them patch you up, and the cops ask you what happened. You’re certain they wouldn’t believe your story about horrible monstrosities demolishing the building from within. Unsure of what to say, you give a vague statement about not remembering much. “We’re bringing you to St. Mary’s,” one of the nurses says, pointing to a nearby ambulance. Knowing now how dire the situation is, you slip away while she is distracted by something else in the rubble…"
