"Light flashes in your mind. Shadows drown your thoughts as the memory fades. You are lying once again on the rocky beach off the coast, your skull pounding in agony. Agent Harper leans over you with worry etched in her brow. \"Hey! Hey, you finally awake?\"\n"
"You set up, your muscles aching. It looks like the tide rose several more inches while you were out. The cold water laps at your ankles and soaks into your shoes. \"What happened?\" she says. \"What did you see?\""

"You tell Harper you remember your mission to find her, but that after a week of searching, you hadn't been able to do so. The last thing you remember was somebody slipping a notebook under your hotel room door with some information regarding an oroganization called the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\n"
"\"Oh. Yeah, that was me. Sorry I couldn't stick around and chat, but I had some other business to attend to,\" she explains. She tells you that after several days in captivity, she finally managed to get the upper hand against her captor and free herself, but she was injured in the process. As if to prove her story, she opens her trenchcoat, and you see dark bloodstains seeping through her button-up shirt. Several bandages peek out beneath the fabric. \"Just barely missed my kidney. Lucky me, eh?\"\n"
"You complain that you were wasting your time searching high and low for her, and she scoffs. \"Hardly! You learned more in one week than I did in two. I knew that you were onto something, and I wanted to help out, but I was still being followed. So I dropped off the one solid bit of research I'd found and laid low for a while. It was you who did the rest really.\" Sadly, you remember nothing of \"the rest.\""

"You tell Harper you remember your mission to find her and the interrogation of her kidnapper. She grins. \"Thanks again for that, by the way. I really did have things under control, though,\" she jokes. \"Do you remember anything after that?\"\n"
"You shake your head. The last thing you remember was the mention of an organization called the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\n"
"Harper mutters a curse under her breath. \"That's unfortunate. But amnesia or not, at least I know I can trust you. Whether you remember it or not, you've come through for me in the past.\""

msgid "\"Don't worry,\" she says, \"I'll catch you up. There's a lot you still don't remember.\" Just then, a resounding crash of thunder echoes on the eastern horizon, and a powerful wave smashes against the jetties. The sky is a deep crimson red behind blackening storm clouds that swirl around the sun and the moon. The celestial bodies hang together in perfect alignment. \"That can't be good.\" Harper's lips turn rigid with concern. \"Okay, new plan. Let's get back to Innsmouth. I'll explain what I know along the way.\""
