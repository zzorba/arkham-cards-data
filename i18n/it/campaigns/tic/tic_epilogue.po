"The drive home to Arkham is quiet. After everything you have been through, you would have thought the quiet to be a peaceful reprieve… but you are alone with your thoughts-thoughts of Innsmouth, of Deep Ones, of enormous monsters dwelling in the depths beneath the waves. You find yourself checking your rearview mirror regularly, waiting to spot the headlights of pursuers who want you dead; the glowing, unblinking eyes of an aquatic horror in your back seat; or perhaps even the cold, dead glare of Thomas Dawson, mutated nearly beyond recognition. But you see nothing. Just an empty road.\n"
"You sigh and run through the events of the past few weeks once more. You believe you have a complete picture of what occurred, and yet you still feel like there is something missing. Another gap in your memories…"

msgid "…you shake the feeling away. It doesn't matter anymore. This whole ordeal is behind you now. Innsmouth, Dagon, Hydra, Y'ha-nthlei-just a terrible memory you wish you could forget, like all those other memories you lost. Your foot lies heavy on the accelerator. The faster you are away from this hellish place, the better."

"You are back in Agent Dawson's office in Boston. He has stepped out for only a brief moment in order to retrieve some documents for you to sign. Some kind of agreement not to speak of anything you might see or hear while working for the government, no doubt. Several minutes pass. You begin to wander throughout the office, examining the many books and maps Dawson has scattered around. Some are harmless enough-a medical textbook, a history of New England, a treatise on the anatomy of aquatic creatures throughout the Atlantic-but the volumes get stranger and stranger the more of his collection you examine.\n"
"Venturing nearer to Dawson's side of the office, you notice that the many books, envelopes, and documents spread across the surface of his desk lie atop an unfolded map. You decide to chance a peek, hoping Dawson's task will keep him from his office for a while longer. Pushing some of the objects in your way aside, you examine the map. It is an enormous nautical chart of the world's oceans, marked in many spots with fresh black ink. A fountain pen lies nearby.\n"
"The marks that Dawson has made are curious, to say the least. There are over a dozen scattered across the seas. Some lie just off the coast of various continents, while others are in the middle of the ocean, their locations marked with wide, unfilled circles to show that their exact coordinates are unknown. Strange words are scribbled next to each. P'tha'wei in the north Atlantic, near Greenland. Yhe'nthalla in the south Atlantic, just off the coast of Africa. R'lyeh deep in the south Pacific. Th'all-iewa by Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean. And at least ten more, some marked with question marks-an indication that this record is incomplete. You gently push aside the book that lies atop North America and see one more just off the coast of Massachusetts. Y'ha-nthlei.\n"
"You slam the brakes and screech to a halt as your mind pulls back to the present. <i>No. It can't be.</i> Your heart twists into a knot as you realize the truth. <i>No-!</i>\n"
"Y'ha-nthlei was not the home of the Deep Ones. It was just one of many."
