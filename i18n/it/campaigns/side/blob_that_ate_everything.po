"<i>Incident Report: 8L-08</i>\n"
"<i>Thursday, 07/05/1928</i>\n"
"<i>Blackwater, MA</i>\n"
"\n"
"<i>0312 hours - Impact event just outside of Blackwater. Intercepted police call, agents sent to investigate. Interviewed local farmer, Ron Graham; claims meteor was several feet wide, greenish hue. Crater roughly 100 yards in diameter. Radiation detected in outlying area. Recommend immediate quarantine and further observation by research team. Situation under control.</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It wasn't under control.\n"
"That was the report the G-men took when they first arrived. For the next few days, the town of Blackwater was on lockdown. The impact was all that was talked about in the papers, but not much was known aside from the enormous crater and the effect it had on the countryside. Nobody was allowed to leave the town, and only those approved by the shadow government agency was allowed to enter. Those unfortunate few included high-ranking government agent, and a team of researchers from the nearby Miskatonic University, who were summoned to investigate the meteor itself. For the rest of the town's inhabitants, it was a strange occurence, nothing more… that is, until the meteor <i>hatched</i>.\n"
"I saw it with my own eyes. When the anomaly emerged, the first thing it did was devour the team of researchers who have been sent to collect and study samples from the meteor. The next thing it did was devour their lab equipment. Then Ron Graham's tractor. Then his house, in its entirety. It continued to grow and spread, devouring everything in its path. I barely escaped with my life.\n"
"When the army arrived, they thought they could kill it with bullets and shells. Everything they threw at the creature was devoured, one round after the next. Then it split into hundreds of smaller pieces of itself, and the army was quickly overwhelmed. While the battle raged on, myself and others back in town saw lights and shapes in the sky above. Something was up there, waiting. Biding time.\n"
"The quarantine still holds, and we're stuck in the middle of it. It won't be long before the anomaly has grown large enough to devour everything in Blackwater. And if that happens, who could possibly stop its rampage?"
