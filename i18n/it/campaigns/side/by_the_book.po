"Red tape is stifling. Ever since you arrived in Arkham, your cases have gotten harder and harder to navigate. You thought you would be tracking down smugglers and mobsters, not imaginary monsters. But the longer your absurd cases remain open, the more you begin to think maybe they aren’t so absurd, after all. And perhaps that means the monsters aren’t imaginary, either.\n"
"The Bureau has countless guidelines for handling cases of all sorts, but it is eerily silent on the matter of human sacrifices. So when you were told about the bodies found inside the Black Cave, you weren’t sure where to begin. Questioning the locals and loved ones of the deceased yielded nothing of value. The evidence left behind in the cave was unhelpful, to say the least—offerings and writings proclaiming the sacrifices to be gifts, along with depictions of a monstrous tree. So you did what you do best: you put your nose to the ground and found the thread connecting all of the deaths.\n"
"One man lies at the center of all of the victims: Mr. Damien Grey. The congressman is not from Arkham, has no relatives or loved ones in the area, and is on no committee that would require his presence in town. And yet, he’s been staying in Arkham for the past few months, his purpose unknown. And he is connected to each of the victims through no more than two degrees of separation, which smells fishy to you. Fishier still is the police escort that follows Mr. Grey through town 24/7, despite the fact that there have been no threats on the congressman’s well-being.\n"
"You have to get to the bottom of this mystery, and soon. Now you see that damned tree everywhere. More people go missing by the day, and some have even claimed to see goatlike monsters prowling the alleyways. But if Mr. Grey is indeed behind this, you’ll have to be careful. Falsely accusing a politician would certainly spell the end of your career. Time to do what you came to do: dig up the proof, discover the truth, and bring the culprits in for questioning. Every “i” dotted, every “t” crossed."

"Your evidence presented and the case closed, you return to your typical day-to-day of investigating bootleggers and common criminals. Those responsible for the murders—those you could catch, anyway—are safely behind bars. With the proof you collected, not even Mr. Grey’s extensive influence can pardon their crimes.\n"
"But returning to your usual cases has proven difficult. Nagging worries pull at your thoughts. Something compelled Mr. Grey and the others to commit these heinous crimes. To sacrifice human lives in the pursuit of some dark, sinister purpose.\n"
"A rot lies beneath the surface of this town like mold hides in the foundations of an old, rotting house.

msgid "No amount of procedure or training could have prepared you for the monsters that emerged during your investigation—both the human ones and the literal ones.

Mr. Grey and his goons may never face the proper consequences for their heinous acts. But at least now you know of the true rot that lies beneath the surface of this town. You’ll be better prepared next time. Rules or no rules."
