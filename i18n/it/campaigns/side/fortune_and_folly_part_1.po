msgid "Your cell has been given the name of a contact at Défis de la Roulette: Isamara Ordoñez. Isamara is not just an employee there, she is the \"Flor de Nicaragua,\" a singer whose performances have become a major draw for the casino. She has reputedly reached out to various parties for help over the course of the past month, concerned with some of the events she has witnessed behind the scenes. The Foundation has reason to believe a Key may be involved in these strange events. You find a table in the casino lounge, and wait for an opportune moment to attract her attention. Only a few minutes later, a woman in a striking red dress takes the stage. Her performance is so captivating that she is already leaving the stage before you remember why you are here. There is no doubt that she is the one you are looking for. As she glances at the crowd, you give a small wave. At first, she appears to take little notice, but then her eyes fall to the flower that you were told to wear. She approaches your table and sits down. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"If you were sent by Them, its not safe to talk here. Meet me in an hour.\" She hands you a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance!\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. Hope to see you again soon!\""
