"When Laurel Fontaine told you about a scientific inquiry into a meteor that touched down in the small town of Eastwick, Massachusetts, you felt a passing interest. When she told you the science team returned empty handed after being threatened and attacked by the town’s stable master despite his previous promises of unfettered access to the meteor, you wondered what she was getting at. That the assault was not the extent of Eastwick’s aberrant behaviour and that it was not limited to the folk left a sinking sensation in your stomach. When she asked you if you would do her a personal favour and look into the town it had felt inevitable.\n"
"Upon arriving in Eastwick, you find a town suffering a quiet degeneracy. The town looks almost abandoned. Doors and windows look hastily boarded up and an eerie glow rolls up over the hills and across the town. You’ll have to try and find some willing townsfolk to make any inroads."

msgid "When the sun rises and the old the stony bridge is enveloped in a warm, natural glow and the thing dissipates, you realize just how much of leap you made. All the pieces fit together, but at the end of the day you had to make a guess. But when the next night comes around, there's no telltale glow around the stables. The strange vegetation has all shrivelled and turned a crumbly, ashen gray. What few diseased farm animals remain have fallen comatose. The overly aggressive wild beasts of the night before are nowhere to be seen. Most of his Eastwick’s surrounding farmland will be fallow years for years to come. Maybe forever. But most of the town is alive thanks is no small part to your intervention."

Soon after the last of the mob feel at your hands, an immense burst of light exploded up from the farms. A streak of unnameable colour flashed up towards the sky and the landscape around you suddenly dimmed. With the evil glow gone, you can no longer see the blood on your hands."
