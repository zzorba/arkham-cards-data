msgid "You decide to study the doorway and the many paths that diverge from this vast tunnel in the hope that you can discover a way to stop the entity on the other side from escaping. You believe that the technology used to seal this door is somehow related to these five glyphs. Perhaps if you explore the surrounding area, you can find the missing pieces."

msgid "Ancient Facility locations exist in multiple encounter sets. (For example, in this scenario, both <i>The Heart of Madness</i> encounter set and <i>The Great Seal</i> encounter set contain Ancient Facility locations.) Because these locations can come from different encounter sets, they have no encounter set icon on their unrevealed side. To see which encounter set an Ancient Facility location belongs to, check its revealed side."

"This scenario introduces five seal tokens that represent important technological artifacts that are needed to contain the madness within The Gate of Y'quaa. Each seal token has its own symbol, as follows: [seal_a], [seal_b], [seal_c], [seal_d], [seal_e].\n"
"Each of these seal tokens has a dormant side and an activated side. The activated side is indicated by the glowing highlight around its symbol.\n"
"Investigators will be instructed when to put seals into play, and whether they are dormant or activated. <b>Seals have no inherent game effect.</b> Investigators must discover how to take control of, activate, and utilize these seals to put an end to this madness.\n"
"When an investigator takes control of a seal, they place it on their investigator card. If an investigator who controls one or more seals is eliminated (except by resignation), remove those seals from the game. Those seals are lost forever.\n"
"As an [action] ability, an investigator may give control of a seal to another investigator at the same location or take control of a seal controlled by another investigator at the same location."

You flee back to the gateway to rest and lick your wounds, but before you can decide what to do next, something slams against the ancient, massive doorway, scaring you nearly to death.
