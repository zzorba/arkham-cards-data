"You have been brought deep into the inner sanctum, where only the highest-ranking members of the Lodge are allowed. Mr. Sanford explains that the Order of the Silver Twilight is far older and more important than the public-facing Silver Twilight Lodge, and that their knowledge extends into the realm of the arcane and the obscure. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and we are the only ones who can stop it. You know the creature I speak of.” You nod in affirmation.\n"
"“Here is what we know: it was the witches who brought this abomination upon Arkham. We tried to stop their ritual, but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in binding it. Now it is loose, and we must finish what we started before the witches are able to do the same. But first, I understand you may have some information for us, as well. Please, hand over what you have found. It is important that we collaborate in order to understand this situation.”"

msgid "You show Mr. Sanford the evidence you’ve collected. “Hm… Yes, I see. It is as I suspected,” he murmurs as he inspects the trinkets."

"You don’t trust Carl Sanford with these pieces of evidence. Who knows what he intends to do with them? In the hands of the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge, any one of these items could be a deadly instrument. You lie, informing him that your investigation has so far proven fruitless. He clenches his jaw and glares at you for a moment, his cold blue eyes staring daggers into yours. “That is disappointing to hear. But perhaps it is my fault; I should not have imposed such a heavy burden on a neophyte to the Order.”\n"
"Mr. Sanford rises to his feet, and the other members of the Order follow suit. He addresses the other members of the Inner Circle: “All right. We have no more time to spare. The ritual must be completed at once. We shall use the same site as before—the central pillar of the Unvisited Isle, where the barrier between this world and the next is thinnest. It is likely that the anomaly will pursue us there, so act with caution.” Then he turns back to you. “We will require your assistance as well, of course. The device you hold is the key to binding the revenant. You must use it properly when the time comes. Do you understand?” You nod in affirmation. Taking a deep breath to steel your nerves, you prepare for the journey to the Unvisited Isle—a journey toward death itself."

msgid "Carl Sanford grins and rises to his feet. “You have proven yourself a loyal asset to our Order. I believe it is time that you ascended to our Inner Circle.” You approach and kneel before Mr. Sanford. He spreads his arms wide and declares, “I hereby appoint to you the rank of Knight of the Inner Circle. Arise once more, knight, and stand tall. You are now one of the elite guardians of humanity, keepers of the truth, and stewards of the Silver Twilight Order.” Another member of the Order offers you a folded blue robe, and you don it solemnly. “Now, I am sure you have many questions for me. We do not have a lot of time to dawdle, but you deserve answers. What do you wish to know?”"

msgid "“It is a powerful remnant, left behind from one who perished long ago. The witches could only have summoned it if they had a strong connection to the soul it once belonged to,” Mr. Sanford explains. “It could only be one person: Keziah Mason herself.”"

msgid "“First and foremost, we need to bind it to prevent it from doing further harm. That is of paramount importance. Once it is bound, we may be able to learn the secrets it possesses without endangering ourselves or others.”"
msgstr ""

msgid "“I am sure they wish to learn its secrets, and draw from its power,” he theorizes, stroking his beard. “Perhaps allow one of their own to become possessed by the spirit, and hence gain power over life and death itself.”"
msgstr ""

msgid "“In truth, yes,” Mr. Sanford admits. “But we did not know it would come to us. After interceding in the witch’s summoning rite, we investigated the spectral mist that was left behind for several days. We likely drew too much attention to ourselves, and it was drawn to our presence. Not necessarily a bad thing, in the end.”"
msgstr ""

msgid "“God only knows,” Mr. Sanford replies with a sigh. “Taken by the revenant, perhaps. Or swallowed by the mist.” He considers this for a while, then adds, “I suspect that if they are still alive, they cannot be far from the revenant. For better or for worse, the anomaly seems localized around it."

"Carl Sanford gives the trinkets and strange components to another member of the Inner Circle, who retrieves them with care and brings them upstairs. “Thank you for your assistance in this matter. We are stronger together than apart; don’t you agree?”\n"
