"It is a breezy November evening in Arkham—the perfect night for a walk through Independence Square, or so you had thought, up until the moment Anna Kaslow offered to tell your fortune. You agreed, though you would soon come to regret this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck, she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune. Judgment. Temperance. Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n"
"“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

"E' una ventosa sera di Novembre ad Arkham, la notte perfetta per una passeggiata in Independence Square, o almeno così pensavate fino al momento in cui Anna Kaslow si è offerta di predirvi il futuro; avete accettato, anche se poco dopo avreste rimpianto amaramente questa decisione. A ogni carta pescata dal mazzo, la zingara intesse una storia di disperazione e disgrazie: Il Giudizio, La Temperanza, La Giustizia, L'Eremita, L'Appeso, Il Papa, Gli Amanti, Il Carro, La Ruota della Fortuna. Per completare la sua storia, Anna pesca la carta in cima al mazzo e la colloca al centro della composizione: sulla vecchia carta consunta svetta l'immagine di un'imponente guglia in onice nero sferzata da una tempesta infernale, i cui oscuri nembi sono squarciati da un fulmine. La scritta sulla carta recita: LA TORRE · XVI. Anche se il resto della lettura andasse a gonfie vele, la vista della carta centrale farebbe correre un brivido lungo la schiena a chiunque: a chiusura di questa predizione, pare quasi il coperchio di un feretro che si richiude su di voi.\n"
"“Mi avevate chiesto di non usare giri di parole”, commenta l'indovina mentre si siede a gambe incrociate davanti a voi con un'espressione cupa e severa. “La sfortuna pura e semplice è l'ultima delle vostre preoccupazioni”, spiega, “questa è una questione di vita o di morte.” Indica con un cenno le carte che circondano la Torre (tutte capovolte) e le fissa attentamente. “Contro di voi è schierato tutto ciò che non riuscite a vedere; e siete completamente soli a contrastarlo” annuncia con fare enigmatico."

msgid "The woman nods and draws the top card of the deck with a steady hand, revealing it to you without looking at it herself. Depicted on the card is a single wooden wand, surrounded by a pattern of broken stained glass. It reads: ACE OF RODS. “You must be ready to act,” she advises. “Without hesitation. Without regret. When the opportunity arises, you must set into motion the events that will change this fate.”"
msgstr "La donna annuisce e pesca la prima carta del mazzo con mano ferma, mostrandovela senza guardarla. Sulla carta è raffigurato un singolo bastone di legno circondato da uno stuolo di vetri istoriati infranti. La scritta recita: ASSO DI BASTONI. “Dovete essere pronti ad agire” vi consiglia. “Senza esitazioni, senza rimpianti. Quando ne avrete l'occasione, dovrete mettere in moto gli eventi che cambieranno il vostro destino.”"

msgid "Before drawing their opening hand for this scenario, the lead investigator searches the collection for 1 copy of The Tower · XVI and 1 copy of Ace of Rods and adds each of them to their deck, if able. The lead investigator has earned these cards. They do not count toward their deck size. (If one or both of these cards are not available, skip this step.)"
msgstr "Prima di pescare la propria mano di partenza per questo scenario, l'investigatore capo cerca nella collezione 1 copia de La Torre · XVI e 1 copia dell'Asso di Bastoni e le aggiunge al suo mazzo (se possibile), non considerandole nella dimensione del suo mazzo. Se una o entrambe queste carte non sono disponibili, saltate questo passo."

msgid "The woman smirks. “Yes, in a sense, I suppose it is,” she responds. With a single swift motion, she picks up each of the cards displayed before you, save for The Tower card, and shuffles them back into the deck. “The cards only reveal and advise. They cannot influence or impose.” She locks eyes with you, and her smile vanishes from her face. “In other words, though your fate is not set in stone, I assure you the danger you face is not ‘bullshit.’ It is real.” Her eyes narrow. “It is very real.”"
msgstr "La donna sorride. “Sì, in un certo senso suppongo di sì” risponde. Con un singolo rapido movimento, raccoglie tutte le carte che vi ha mostrato prima, tranne La Torre, e le rimescola nel mazzo. “Le carte possono solo rivelare e consigliare, non possono influenzare o imporre.” Il suo sguardo incrocia il vostro e il sorriso svanisce dal suo volto. “In altre parole, sebbene il vostro destino non sia scolpito nella pietra, vi assicuro che il pericolo che state per affrontare non è 'un'idiozia'. E' reale.” Poi socchiude gli occhi: “Molto reale.”"

"Silence hangs in the air as you peer into The Tower card. The world around you dissolves into emptiness as your eyes fixate on the onyx tower. Rolling thunder echoes in the distance. “Do you understand now?” Anna asks. There is no other sign of the soothsayer: only her strained voice. A bolt of lightning streaks across the sky. “Do you see your fate before you, as I do?”\n"
"Another resounding crack of thunder, and you are suddenly awake. Icy rain pelts your body, soaking you through to the bone. You are lying in the mud beside a wooded trail, and there is no other soul in sight…"

"Nell'aria aleggia il silenzio più totale mentre esaminate la carta della Torre. Il mondo intorno a voi sembra svanire nel nulla e il vostro sguardo restafisso sulla torre di onice. Il rombo di un tuono echeggia in lontananza. “Ora capite?” L'unica cosa che percepite dell'indovina è la sua voce tesa. Un fulmine squarcia il cielo. “Vedete il vostro destino dinanzi a voi, come lo vedo io?”\n"
"Un altro tuono rimbomba nell'aria e vi svegliate di soprassalto. Una pioggia gelida infradicia i vostri corpi, penetrando dentro di voi e bagnandovi fino alle ossa. Siete stesi a terra nel fango accanto a un sentiero boschivo e non c'è anima viva in vista..."

"Despite her wounds, the leader of the coven rises to her feet. More of the hooded figures emerge from the tree line, eager to defend their leader. “Interloper!” one calls you, pulling off her hood and pointing a gnarled wooden rod in your direction. Her bright-red hair glows in the firelight, embers dancing about her extended hand. “They’re the ones from before, High Priestess: the ones who interfered with our great work.”\n"
"The “High Priestess” holds up a single hand, and a hush falls over the other witches. “As always, I admire your perseverance, sister. But I do not believe these are the ones you speak of,” she replies to the red-haired accuser. You lower your weapons as several of the hooded figures approach and surround their leader. They begin chanting in a soft tone as they examine her wounds. The red-haired witch crosses her arms and watches you with a hard glare, her gaze never straying far from you. “I am Anette,” says the leader of the coven, “and these are my sisters. Tell me: Who are you, and why are you here?”\n"
"You explain how you awoke in the woods, how you were attacked by terrible creatures, and how you came to the center of this circle in order to break the spell surrounding the woods. Anette’s eyes narrow as she hears your story. “That is impossible. The circle was closed. None could enter the woods while we were completing our spell.” She grits her teeth. “You must go at once. This is not your place.”\n"
"“But, High Priestess!—” the red-haired witch exclaims, only to be interrupted by Anette’s gaze. The two lock eyes, a battle of wills that quickly proves Anette victorious.\n"
"“Stand down, Erynn,” Anette says with a firm, motherly tone, as though admonishing a child. She turns her attention back to you as the witch named Erynn lowers her head in defeat. “Go. You’ve broken the spell, just as you desired. You can leave the woods now. But I give you one final warning: cross us again, and we will not be so merciful.”\n"
"You begin to protest, but before you are able to utter a single word, a dark gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing. Shadows from beyond the tree line suddenly twist and coil into the clearing, tugging at the edges of the witches’ cloaks. One by one, the shadows twist and pull each of the witches into the darkness beyond. In moments, they are gone. You are left with only the soft glow of moonlight to guide you home."

"With the spell broken, the hooded figures turn their attention to you.

"You collapse to the ground in exhaustion, your head swimming with otherworldly voices and the high- pitched piping of a hundred discordant flutes. Your entire body rattles with the sensation. Blood trickles from your ears, and tears well in your eyes. You try to crawl to safety, but it is to no avail. The piping only grows in volume, the discordant cacophony shattering your eardrums and turning your thoughts to sludge. Eventually, after what feels like hours, weariness claims your consciousness.\n"
"When you next awaken, it is by the side of Hangman’s Brook, where a small child is shaking you vigorously by the shoulders. “Get back here; don’t touch them!” the child’s mother calls to the boy, and he recoils from you. Considering the state you’re in, you wouldn’t be surprised if she thought you some kind of rummy. You brush some of the caked dirt off of your coat and rise begrudgingly to your feet, wandering toward Uptown."
