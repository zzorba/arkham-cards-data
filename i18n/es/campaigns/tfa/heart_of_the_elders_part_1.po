"It has been several days since your party ventured forth into the rainforest once more, and each day, the hazards you face grow more dangerous and frequent. Securing enough food and supplies for the journey is a constant struggle, and you are harrassed at every turn by the jungle’s inhabitants. Fortunately, you have seen no sign yet of the serpent people who attacked the previous expedition, but you’re positive they are out there. Watching. Waiting.\n"
"On the morning of the sixth day, you find the entrance. It is a huge cave opening, partially obscured by trees, brush, and vines. You nearly missed the great cavern maw altogether, despite its enormity. Surrounding the cavern’s entrance are six stone pillars, each covered in strange grooves and carvings that glow with a dim red hue. Perhaps one of your guides will understand what this means?"

msgid "“The entrance is warded against intruders,” Ichtaca says cryptically, her eyes closed as though probing the cavern with unnatural senses. “These pillars are the key. Each is a test of wit and will.” She steps toward one of them and touches it with her palm, and its glow brightens. You notice now that the grooves along the pillar’s foundation depict a pattern you have seen somewhere before. If Ichtaca believes this place to be warded, you trust her opinion—there must be some way to break these wards..."

msgid "Alejandro examines each of the pillars studiously. “It is a lock of some sort. Look here, see? The grooves do not line up perfectly.” He twists one of the pillars, and you can see the pattern along its side shifting. “I wager if we entered the cave, we would not get very far without these pillars in the correct formation. Just a hunch, I suppose...But I think we should examine this area further before we proceed.” You know Alejandro well enough by now to know that his hunches tend to be correct."

msgid "The previous expedition’s journal doesn’t have all the answers, but as you browse its pages, you are struck by a familiar diagram—one drawn by Lorenzo, an expedition member who never made it back to Arkham. It is a delicate recreation of a carving that was on the wall of one of the Eztli ruins. Many of the patterns and hieroglyphs you see in this drawing are shared among these pillars. It cannot simply be a coincidence. These pillars are surely the key to finding your way to N’kai..."
