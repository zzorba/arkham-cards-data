msgid "In contrast to your initial journey to Singapore, you take a much slower route back to Arkham.  Though the immediate danger has passed, you still don't know how the cult of Cthulhu coordinates worldwide.  Anyone you pass at the docks could be secretly among their ranks, waiting to strike at any time.  Long tense weeks pass before you finally make berth at Kingsport and return to the snowy streets of Arkham once more."

You peek through the curtains to scan the street, and barely visible through the snow, a lone figure in a trenchcoat stares back at you before dousing a cigarette and striding slowly away."
