"Saturday, November 12th, 1927.  Arkham, Massachusetts.\n"
"The various archaeological expeditions of Miskatonic University frequently captured the public's imagination for their theories taken to exotic lands and curiosities returned from the same.  The ancient trophies were always certain to be exotic and interesting, but were often few and far between.  Over the past eight months, however, the university received generous funding from an entrepreneur named James Wycliffe to finance multiple expeditions throughout the globe.  Each enterprise returned a success, improving the reputations of everyone involved and stocking the displays of the Miskatonic Museum with fresh exhibits.  So highly anticipated was their most recent expedition to Mycenae in Greece, that some of the university's more eager professors nearly canceled their classes for the day that the expedition was due back in Arkham.  It was fortunate that they did not, as the expedition failed to appear.\n"
"While you may have expected a delay due to bad weather or a shipwreck at very worst, what you didn't expect was the letter addressed to you personally from James Wycliffe himself.  You didn't see a courier come or go, but the letter was waiting on your doormat first thing the very next morning."

"<fancy>The reputations of myself and the Mycenae expedition are at stake, so this information cannot be made public, and cannot involve the police. The expedition returned to Kingsport and sent its cargo upriver to Arkham, but nothing arrived at the university. Foul play is suspected. Search the Miskatonic riverfront for any evidence of the expedition cargo and identify the thieves if possible.</fancy>\n"

msgid "The vague manifest of the missing items and the generous cash advance both included with the letter only build on your suspicion.  Why does Wycliffe suspect foul play?  Why does he insist that such a high-profile mission be kept a secret?  And why would he come to you specifically?  Your experience with investigation usually dips into paranormal territory.  If Wycliffe's expedition uncovered anything of this nature, then who could learn about it quickly enough to hijack it?  The questions rack up, but you have no current course of action but to prepare for a busy evening."
