msgid "The Great Lift and Sliding Locations"
msgstr ""

msgid "Time seems to slip away as you follow the dark tunnels out of the heart of the city. Eventually the constant churn and thrum of machinery melts away, replaced by an ominous silence. Andy has only just proposed that you turn around to find another route when the endless stairs come to a stop. An intricately carved door is set in the ceiling above you. Pressing a panel in its center reveals a vast, airy structure that vaguely resembles the nave of some ancient alien cathedral. A towering lift dominates the center, surrounded by spiraling ringed floors. The walls are covered in countless alien glyphs, pulsing with green light. You wonder if the great archive might hold anything valuable."

"You land on the top floor of the towering nave. Twisting stairs and catwalks circle the sprawling structure, revealing more levels below. The walls around you are covered in glowing alien glyphs: hundreds of thousands of symbols covering every surface. You wonder if the great archive might hold anything valuable.\n"
"“Watch yourself. We’re not the first ones here,” says Ruby. The jewel thief is bent over a prone human body lying in a pool of fresh blood. You’re struck by their colorful patchwork cloak. A deep, rumbling roar reverberates through the chamber. Ruby’s expression turns grave.\n"
"“If we’re going to find anything of value, we’d better act quickly.”"

"You can’t help but marvel at the austere grandeur of the ancient structure. Was this an ancient palace? A library? A place of worship? The intricate murals on the walls are a blend of pictograph and alien writing, depicting an ancient migration across the stars. The glyphs glow with a flickering green light, chronicling unknowable histories, ancient secrets hidden from humankind.\n"
"One image—a nightmarescape of oceanic horrors and sunken cities—catches your attention. You press the eye of a particularly disturbing creature and feel a rush of ancient memories. Thoughts and feelings of an alien being, images of the stygian depths of some distant planet, overwhelm your consciousness. The memories give way to clearer, more defined facts, dates, a history recorded by a prehistoric civilization. You begin to feel yourself slip away as though your consciousness were being drawn through a sieve. There is much more you could learn… but should you?"
