msgstr ""

msgid "A flowering procession filled with riotous, gaudy colors files through the village toward the Crossroads. There must be several hundred people here tonight, if not more. You keep pace with Dr. Marquez toward the ghoulish effigy, spinning with reflected lights. Mother Rachel stands at the center of the crowd, holding her arms out like branches before the mirrored tree."

msgid "The professor strides forward, holding Rebecca’s hand. All festivities cease as Mother Rachel turns around. “Everyone listen! Last night, Mother Rachel condemned a house full of sick people to death. I was there. They were not in their right mind.” Dr. Marquez entreats the revelers. “But that’s not all. There’s something living underneath this island. It’s sucking the life out of everything around it, and could devastate this entire village. We need to leave the island at once!” Mother Rachel looks at you, wounded. “What do you accuse me of? I gave my daughter as a sacrifice, and she was given back to me.”"

"The professor strides forward and shouts above the revelry. “The food here is poison! You’re all in grave danger: whatever this is, it’s changing everything around it. See?” Dr. Marquez tears mask after mask off each reveler, exposing frenzied, grinning faces. The surrounding crowd goes silent. Then, a clapping sounds, along with the sound of laughter. Mother Rachel raises her arms to silence them. “Cast out these slanderers! But let it not keep us from our celebration. The heavens beckon us! Let us feast!”\n"

I was myself as I ought to be: a transfiguration of this tired earthly self. Transformed. Remade in paradise. For paradise is creation as it was always meant to be.”\n"

Remade in paradise—”\n"
"You interrupt her reverie with a perfectly-timed strike. Mother Rachel staggers back, but then, with an almost unnatural strength, she steadies herself. Her composure broken, she draws a long ceremonial knife and glowers wickedly.\n"
