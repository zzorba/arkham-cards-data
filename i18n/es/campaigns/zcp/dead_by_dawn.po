"Midnight comes and goes with little progress. The quiet streets of Rivertown seem to hold no signs as to the source of the monstrosities you've been fighting against. Just as you're considering finding somewhere to catch some sleep, your attention is caught by the sound of wheels rattling on unpaved stones. You peer into a nearby alley, and see a man in a doctor's coat trying to push a wobbling gurney through a side door. A man whose face you recognize.\n"
"It takes you a moment to place him, but the mousy figure can only be Doctor West - one of your two attending physicians at St. Mary's. What is he doing here? At this time of night? With a dead body?\n"
"Before you can answer, several cars come barreling down the street. By the time they've passed, West is nowhere to be seen."

"You look down the street, and see a band of armed agents pouring out of the cars. To your surprise, Agent Greyson exits the lead car. Before she can turn to address the gathered agents, you run out and flag her down.\n"
"\"Certainly didn't expect to see you all here. Can't be a coincidence, though. We're looking for Asset Delta-Two. He's an expert. Might know how to stop all this. Goes by Herbert West. He-\"\n"
"You interrupt, explaining your connection to the man, as well as what you just saw. Greyson eyes you with surprise.\n"
"\"Aren't you full of the unexpected? Well, if you're up to it, we're going in after him. What do you say - feel like joining the cavalry?\""

"You look down the street, and see a band of armed  agents pouring out of the cars. A cruel looking man in a vest exits the lead car, throwing a cigarette onto the ground and grinding it out. He turns to address the gathered agents.\n"
"\"Listen up, boys. We've tracked Asset Delta-Two back to this location. You want payback for all the good men these freaks have killed? For Greyson? Well, Delta-Two knows how to get it. He's not gonna come easy, so any force short of lethal on the target is authorized. Anyone else could be infected, so kill on sight.\" The man grins like a shark.\n"
"Either Delta-Two is West, or the doctor is in real danger. Regardless, you need to get to him before these agents do - he might know how you got into this whole mess!"

"You look down the street, and see a band of armed agents pouring out of the cars. To your surprise, Agent Greyson exits the lead car. You sneak closer as she addresses the gathered agents.\n"
"\"Alright, Tailors. We've tracked Asset Delta-Two back to this condemned brownstone. We believe Delta-Two knows how we might put a stop to all this. However, he should be considered extremely dangerous in his own right, and is unlikely to come with us willingly. Do what you have to do. Finally, anyone else you run into isn't cleared for Delta-Two's experiments. Terminate any civilians you find.\"\n"
"Either Delta-Two is West, or the doctor is in real danger. Regardless, you need to get to him before these agents do - he might know how you got into this whole mess!"
