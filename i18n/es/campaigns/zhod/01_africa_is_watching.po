"After a smooth crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, you arrive with a clear view of the Congolese coast. You are impressed by the bustling life of the people there, the to-and-fro of the merchant ships and the fragile crafts maneuvered by the indigenous people. In the distance, you can see a large Western warship shelling the bush, for no apparent reason or consequence, and apparently without causing any alarm.\n"
"Once you arrive in Boma, the capital of the Belgian Congo situated at the mouth of the river, you embark on a shuttle that travels between Boma and the Company's Central Station, located a little further upriver. The coolness you felt from the ocean air throughout the journey begins to give way to a humid heat, which gradually becomes more suffocating.\n"
"Before arriving at the Company's Central Station, you review once again the papers that Mr. Promise provided regarding Kurtz. One photograph in particular draws your attention. It shows a young, vibrant and happy-looking Kurtz, looking sharp in his bush outfit, with a shotgun in one hand and helmet in the other."

"Returning to Africa may have awakened something within you, for you have a reminiscence of the dream that brought you here. The man in the photograph looks very similar to the man in your dreams, even his clothes seem identical.\n"
"There is one detail that puzzles you. In the dream, the man was wearing clothes that were too loose for him. If it is Kurtz you dreamt about, he must have lost a lot of weight since the picture was taken. That would mean he is much more ill than the latest Company reports suggested."

"Once on site, the ambiance is as lively as ever, with Company employees continuously loading and unloading crates of merchandise. All this excitement spins your head a little, and you have a general sense that something is not quite right. As agreed with Mr. Promise, you report to the Director of the Central Station.\n"
"You find him standing in front of his office door, waiting for you. The Belgian expat is unremarkable in all ways: age, complexion, traits, manners, height, white-skinned and dark-haired. Only his blue eyes, particularly cold, seemed out of the ordinary.\n"
"\"Hello.\" he says, somewhat curtly. \"You must be the one Mr. Promise told me about? Great, but unfortunately we won't be going anywhere just now. The only boat we had that could navigate the sandbanks upriver ran aground not far from here. That's what happens when the crew doesn't have a captain skilled enough to safely maneuver on the river. We did have one, to start with, but the last attempt to bring Kurtz back to the Company was... how shall I put it? Disastrous, yes. They were just mercenaries, but still... Well, I know that Mr. Promise expects you to find a peaceful solution to this problem, but I intend to take a few precautions for our trip upriver, just in case. I will accompany you on your mission, as well as a team I have personally selected to resolve this problem... once and for all. If there is no other solution, of course. Bringing that devil Kurtz back is your priority, but I'll be honest - I have other, more urgent matters to attend to at the moment, and most of my workforce is occupied elsewhere. I therefore leave you in charge of repairing the ship.\"\n"
"The director walks away, then turns back and calls out: \n"
"\"Oh, and by the way, welcome to the Congo!\""

"You wake up in the Station's infirmary. Dazed, you look around. The place is full of injured or traumatized people. You ask your fellow survivors what the situation is at the Station. They tell you that, following the increasing tensions of the last few days, the anger of the workers at the Central Station has given way to a riot, but the details remain unclear. You feel strong enough to get up and go to see the Director to learn more, but you don't have far to go. You find him just outside the infirmary, clearly waiting for you. As soon as he sees you, he calls out:\n"
"\"Ah, you're finally on your feet! You missed one hell of a fight, to say the least. I had a hard time calming things down, but for now things are under control again at the Station. I've had to temporarily suspend the works, and make a few compromises to ease the tension. The good news is that I was able to free up enough of the workforce to complete the repairs on the ship. If you feel strong enough, let's meet tomorrow at dawn on deck to go and get that devil Kurtz.\""

Your head wound appears to have healed, but you suffer a splitting headache as soon as you get up. You likely suffered a concussion. You clench your teeth and decide to go out to see the Director to find out more about the situation. You don't have far to go, since you find him just outside the infirmary. He was clearly waiting for you because as soon as he sees you he calls out:\n"

"As dawn breaks the next day, you find yourself on board the Roi des Belges, ready to set off in search of Kurtz. The Director comes aboard shortly afterwards, accompanied by a small group of Westerners, all armed with guns and equipped for an expedition into the brush.\n"
"With everyone on board, you hear the disturbing noises of the boiler starting up. The workers involved in finishing the repairs may not have been as attentive as you might have been, considering they wouldn't be the ones aboard for the long journey to the heart of the Congo. The ship's paddle wheels slowly start to turn. The captain, an Englishman by the name of Marlow, sets course for the upper reaches of the river, which runs deep into the eastern Congo."

"The weather is relatively pleasant for your first day aboard the Roi des Belges, and nothing remarkable has occurred. Captain Marlow is an excellent navigator. With him at the helm, the ship glides through the quiet waters of the river, skillfully avoiding any sandbanks that arise.\n"
"The crew chats merrily and you learn that most of the passengers are first time travelers to these parts. The newcomers are \"Pilgrims\", yet it is unclear to you what their pilgrimage involves. Many of them try to shoot the animals that come to drink on the banks of the river, as if on safari. Their accuracy is terrible, and they rarely hit their mark. You aren't sure whether you should be reassured or concerned about their presence on board.\n"
"The day passes quickly and you head off to take a well-deserved rest in your cabin. You are exhausted from your previous experiences. The sound of the water splashing against the hull lulls you to sleep almost immediately..."
