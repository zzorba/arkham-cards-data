Thick black smoke suddenly comes out of every pore of his skin. Hundreds of wisps of smoke are drawn towards the statuette, which absorbs this manifestation of darkness. A few moments later, it is all over. Kurtz lies on the ground, unconscious but alive. The mystical African chanting has fallen silent, replaced by the familiar sounds of the jungle. The statuette has not changed, but you now know that it contains one of the most dangerous beings in the Mythos.\n"
