"After a difficult first night, you enjoy a relatively calm start to the journey. The days pass without any remarkable incident, your journey being interrupted only by the ship calling in at the Stations along the river. Captain Marlow is an excellent mariner and easily avoids the sandbanks that caught the Roi des Belges during its last voyage in these difficult waters.\n"
"At one of the stops, you see a group of Congolese warriors in traditional dress embarking. When you ask the Director who has joined you, he tells you to your great astonishment that it is a tribe of cannibal mercenaries that he has hired to protect the ship and its occupants.\n"
"\"Don't worry,\" says the Director, trying to reassure you, \"they are not exclusively cannibals, they also eat animal meat. I think they have a preference for hippo meat.\"\n"
"The Director walks away, patting you on the shoulder before you even have a chance to say anything.\n"
"In spite of this, a somewhat monotonous daily routine eventually settles over the ship."

"You have time to think about the information you have discovered about Kurtz. The more you think about it, the more you begin to see the man he was when he embarked on his first journey up the river.\n"
"He was confident, sure of his strength, and he had a definite goal in coming here, but this land probably had other plans for him. You can almost feel that the country is a living entity watching you, scrutinizing you more closely than ever.\n"

"The days are long and you don't have much to do except talk to the other passengers on board the Roi des Belges. Contrary to what you feared, the cannibal mercenaries are not a problem. You even get to know their medicine man, a middle-aged man who speaks your language and is called Mateso. You are chatting with him about the country you are passing through when a young Congolese sailor comes up to you, panicked.\n"
"\"It's Captain Marlow!\" he exclaims, \"he just collapsed at the helm, you have to come help him!\"\n"
"You and Mateso run to the helmsman's post and discover Marlow lying unconscious. A pilgrim has taken the wheel and frequently glances over at you. He seems unsure of what to do.\n"
"Mateso leans over Marlow's sweaty face, examining him carefully.\n"
"After a few minutes, he straightens up and announces gloomily:\n"
"\"Your captain is seriously ill. I recognize the symptoms. I am afraid it is something beyond our capabilities. Unless... Yes, I think I know how to help him, but the outcome is not guaranteed. Also, I am missing an ingredient. It is a medicinal plant, which we call \"jani la mfalme\". It has purple flowers that seem to glow even in the daylight. It was once used by our ancestors, but it has become rare in recent years. If you can find me some, I can prepare a remedy for your captain.\"\n"
"You thank the medicine man and hurry to inform the Director of the situation.\n"
"\"That is... unfortunate,\" the Director replies, \"without Marlow I don't know if we'll make it safely up this damned river. I am counting on you to make sure that our trip to the Inner Station is successful. If you have time, you can go and look for this incredible plant, but I doubt that a magical remedy can save our captain. I've dealt with the devastating disease that has befallen him before, when I was at a Station not far from the one Kurtz is currently holding. Believe me, he is already dead.\"\n"
"Something tells you that you will soon miss the monotony of the first few days on board the Roi des Belges."

You have almost forgotten your objective. Your consciousness briefly resurfaces when one of the Pilgrims informs you that only two months have passed on board the Roi des Belges. You are already only half listening when he adds that the journey is nearing its end. The steamer is only a day or two away from the Inner Station. But you're not listening anymore. Only the Darkness occupies your thoughts. Your mind is as if detached from your body.\n"
"You see yourself disembarking on a worm-eaten pier, greeted by a rather thin, blond young man dressed in an outfit so patched and mended with bits of fabric of all colors that he could be taken for a harlequin. Who is he? Why is he dressed like that? These questions only flit across your mind before vanishing into limbo. The strange person tells you that Kurtz is coming.\n"
"And indeed, like foam carried by the waves, a man enthroned on a palanquin lifted by a dozen men of the Black Hand tribe descends from a hill. He is very thin and his skin is sickly pale. Now that he is close enough, you see that his body radiates a dark energy. His eyes are black, completely black. The bearers set the the palanquin down in front of you and prostrate themselves before Kurtz, who is suddenly transformed. Piece by piece, his alabaster skin shatters and reveals the Darkness that was eating Kurtz from the inside. He stands up straight, grows bigger and becomes a being of pure darkness before your eyes. All around you, the light of day is absorbed, as if an eclipse had suddenly fallen on the Congo. When the whole of Kurtz's physical body has dissolved into nothingness, the huge creature of Darkness facing you bends its head towards you and smiles. This triggers something in you. You have never felt this before. Never really. How to describe it? A word comes to your lips, but you can't voice it.\n"
"\"Here you are at last,\" says the being who was Kurtz. \"It is time. A great task awaits us.\"\n"
