msgid "Scenario III–B: Point of No Return"

msgid ""
"You have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. This cyclopean cavern is far from the wondrous lands and fabulous cities described in Virgil Gray’s writings. Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he wouldn’t have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark and barren realm, you are filled with hollow despair—an emptiness that gnaws at your heart and mirrors the bleak landscape all around you. You came here to help your friends, and now your only guide through this realm is gone. What if this was all a horrible mistake?\n"
"You shake these dark thoughts from your mind and focus on the path that lies ahead of you. It’s too late to dwell on what you could have done differently. This is your way forward now. Even if you cannot help your friends, even if you are too late to help Randolph, you have another mission now. Clearly this region of the Dreamlands has something to do with the creatures invading your reality. The answers must lie here. Besides, it’s not like you have much choice anymore.\n"
"You walk to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. This realm is staggeringly vast. In the distance, along the cliffs, you see a walled city, of all things. Among its many towers, a black spire rises so high it must pierce the surface of the Dreamlands. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below, and you can see shapes moving throughout the grey, phosphorescent light. You hope the beings who inhabit this realm are ones you might be able to reason with. You have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

"You have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. This cyclopean Underworld is far from the wondrous lands and fabulous cities described in Virgil Gray’s writings. Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he would not have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark, barren realm, you raise your concerns with Randolph. “It is true that we are farther from your companions than we intended, he affirms. “However, if I may offer another sentiment—perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Clearly the Underworld has something to do with the creatures invading our reality. I suggest we investigate further while we have the chance. We can return to the surface of the Dreamlands once we have discovered the truth.”\n"
"You ask Randolph if he has any leads, and he steps to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. “I have been here before,” he says quietly, getting his bearings. “Those walls in the distance belong to the City of Gugs. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below. That plain is where the ghouls live. Perhaps there we can learn more.” You raise your doubts aloud, wondering if such creatures are even capable of peaceful conversation. “They are more intelligent than you think, and could be quite helpful if we convince them to aid us. In fact, there is one I count among my friends, an artist by the name of Richard Pickman. If we are fortunate enough to find him, that might be our best chance.” You still have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

msgid "The black, tarry liquid rises around you, consuming you, and you fear that you’ve made a grave mistake. The pressure of the dense liquid surrounds your body, crushing you from all sides. But then you emerge on the other side. You fall for a brief, silent moment before being caught by a glowing, sinewy web. Panicking, you scramble to a nearby platform made of solid rock. Your refuge is one of many, each suspended in the air and connected by thick webbing. Beyond that is a vast, cosmic space, an infinite darkness that stretches as far as the eye can see."

"You brace yourself as another wave of distorted reality crashes into you. This feeling, whatever it is, is growing stronger as time marches on. Someone or something is causing it, but how? Just as you are pondering its meaning, you realize something curious: you aren’t the only one affected. Far from it, in fact; the entirety of the Underworld seems to be changing with each wave of warped energy that flows through the realm. Walls shift, the floor skews, and the dim, phosphorescent light scintillates with a cosmic, otherworldly glow. The ground rumbles as another wave of force rushes through the foundations of the dream world. The rocky surface upon which you stand gives way. You flail in the air, attempting to grab hold of something, anything that you can use to pull yourself up. Your hands wrap around a painted plank of wood. You have no time to question its appearance—survival comes first.\n"
"When you pull yourself up, you realize you are curled up on a park bench, surrounded by a thick fog and the grim, gambrel rooftops of Arkham. There is no ground in front of you. Just an open, endless pit into fathomless depths. The Underworld, perhaps? But how is that possible? Virgil’s cat watches you casually from a tree branch that hangs over the park bench. “It won’t stop,” the black cat tells you. “Not until there is nothing left of your world.” You wonder what you could possibly do in the face of such horror. The cat gazes down into the pit below. “It’s waiting for you.”\n"
"Another rumble. In the distance, you watch with horror as an entire building is sucked into the ground. You think you spot a pedestrian in the distance, but it is no human. If this goes on any longer, your companions won’t have a world to awaken to. You steel yourself, look down into the empty pit, and gulp. “Down you go,” the cat says.\n"
"You fall. The roar of the wind is deafening as it whips by your head. You can’t possibly survive a fall like this, you think. But instead of splattering against a hard, rocky ground, you are caught by a glowing, sinewy web. Panicking, you scramble to a nearby platform made of solid rock. Your refuge is one of many, each suspended in the air and connected by thick webbing. Beyond that is a vast, cosmic space, an infinite darkness that stretches as far as the eye can see."
