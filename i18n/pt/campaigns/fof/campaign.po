msgstr ""

In <i>Fortune and Folly</i>, a unique scenario for <i>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</i>, 1-4 investigators must plan and execute a daring heist in order to capture the source of this cult's power and put a stop to their nefarious work. But will their meddling turn fortune in their favor? Or will their luck run out?"

msgid "Alarm Level"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The setup of this scenario instructs the players to place 1 doom on each investigator card, marking their current “alarm level.” As the heist progresses, alarm level may increase or decrease based on the investigators' actions and decisions. A higher alarm level means the casino is closer to discovering your actions, which will endanger the chances of a successful heist. If an effect raises an investigator’s alarm level by any amount, place that much doom on that investigator’s card to represent this. Likewise, if an effect reduces an investigator’s alarm level by any amount, remove that much doom from that investigator’s card. <b>An investigator's alarm level cannot be reduced below 1 or raised above 10.</b>\n"
"Even though it is marked using doom tokens, an investigator’s alarm level is not doom, and does not count toward the agenda’s doom threshold.\n"
"An investigator’s alarm level has the following additional effect:"

msgid "Patrol"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some enemies have the patrol keyword. During the enemy phase (in framework step 3.2), each ready, unengaged enemy with the patrol keyword moves to a connecting location along the shortest path toward the designated location (as described in parentheses next to the word patrol)."
msgstr ""

msgid "If there are multiple locations that qualify as the designated location, the lead investigator may choose which location the enemy moves toward."
msgstr ""

msgid "If an enemy with patrol would be compelled to move to a location which is blocked by a card ability, the enemy does not move."
msgstr ""

msgid "During this scenario, locations are arranged into two main \"hubs\" consisting of either [[Public]] or [[Restricted]] locations. If an enemy's patrol location is move to the connecting location in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction for the hub they are in. Enemies do not patrol between hubs in this manner unless they move via another method."

msgid "Game Icons"
msgstr ""

msgid "Encounter card abilities in this scenario will sometimes ask an investigator to discard cards from the encounter deck in order to \"check their game icons.\" To do so, that investigator discards the specified number of encounter cards and checks the game icons listed on each. The icons will consist of a color (red or black), a suit (♥, ♦, ♠, or ♣), and a rank (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, or K)."
msgstr ""

msgid "For the purpose of determining numerical value, J, Q, and K counts as 10. For the purposes of determining color, ♥ and ♦ are red, while ♠ and ♣ are black."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the encounter deck runs out of cards while checking for game icons, set aside the cards that have already been discarded, shuffle the remainder of the discard pile into the encounter deck, then continue discarding cards."
msgstr ""

msgid "\"Sequential rank\" on a card effect indicates that the rank of checked game icons are in consecutive order (i.e. \"in a row\")."
msgstr ""

msgid "If a card with no game icons is discarded, set it aside and discard an additional card in its place. <i>(Any cards set aside this way are discarded once game icons have been checked.)</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note: A rank of \"A\" is present on some encounter cards. These particular cards do not enter the encounter deck and therefore these icons are never used when checking game icons."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mulligans"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some [[Game]] location efffects that instruct you to discard cards from the encounter deck will specify that you can take a mulligan. This means that after an investigator discards the specified number of encounter cards and checks their game icons, they can set aside as many of those discarded cards as they wish. Then, they discard an equal number of cards from the encounter deck to replace the set-aside cards. Once the effect is resolved, they discard the set-aside cards."

msgid "The Wellspring of Fortune"
msgstr ""

msgid "This scenario includes The Wellspring of Fortune, which is a \"key,\" a new cardtype introduce in <i>The Scarlet Keys</i> campaign. The full rules for the key cardtype can be found in <i>The Scarlet Keys</i> campaign guide. For the purposes of this scenario, The Wellspring of Fortune is only used as a marker for tokens and an objective for investigators to obtain. <b>Treat The Wellspring of Fortune's text box as if it were blank for the duration of this scenario.</b> The full rules for key cards are therefore not required to play this scenario; however, if the investigators are playing this scenario as part of <i>The Scarlet Keys</i> campaign, they cmay be able to earn The Wellspring of Fortune and use it in future scenarios."
msgstr ""

msgid "This scenario is split into two parts. Players may choose to play these parts one at a time (with a break between each part), or they may play both parts one after the other as part of a longer session. Each part is its own game with its own setup and resolution. After completing the first part of this scenario, the campaign guide directs the investigators to a Checkpoint that instructs them on how to proceed. If the investigators wish to proceed directly to the next part of the scenario, the Checkpoint instructs them on how to clean up the game to prepare for the next part. If the investigators wish to take a break and resume playing during their next game session, the Checkpoint instructs them to record information in the Campaign Log that makes setup for the next session quick and easy."
