"Gulls cry out as you cross the Galata Bridge: what many would call the link between the traditional city of Constantinople, and the districts of Galata, Beyoğlu, Şişli and Harbiye, where a large proportion of foreign merchants and diplomats live and work. Since you know where you are headed, and time and secrecy are of the essence, you decide against hiring a translator, and head directly to the Süleymaniye Complex, where the target of your investigation—a Ms. Ece Şahin—supposedly works.\n"
"Ms. Şahin has made a name for herself in several fields of academia, specifically in the fields of antiquity and art history. According to your intel, she works as a curator in the recently established Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, but to your surprise, your case files include a wealth of other information about Ms. Şahin, from her schooling all the way back to her early life. All of this points to one of two conclusions: either she is not in hiding like the other members of the Coterie, or she has crafted an extensive cover story.\n"
"According to your intel, Ms. Şahin has already reached out to the Foundation by way of an offer of introduction. It could be a trap, but if she truly wishes to meet, you can’t turn down such an opportunity. Thankfully, her office is not difficult to find, the door marked with her name and full title in Turkish and several other languages. You knock and she bids you to enter, which you do with much caution, eyes instinctively darting to every one of the room’s corners and hiding places.\n"
"The room is warm and richly decorated, the walls covered in beautiful tapestries and paintings of many styles ranging from hundreds of years old to very recent, and shelves filled to the brim with a variety of colorful ceramics, glassware, and old, musty texts. “Greetings,” Ms. Şahin says with a warm smile that seems to brighten the room. She is a young woman with dark tan skin, hazel eyes, and the wispy figure of one who has spent her entire life in academia. “What can I do for you?”\n"
"You inform Ms. Şahin that you received her “earlier communication” and her desire to meet with you, which she takes a moment to interpret before her eyes go wide.\n"
"“Oh! So you are—” she clears her throat and does not finish that train of thought. “I see. Then, in that case, please, sit down. We have much to discuss.”\n"
"You tell Ms. Şahin that she can start by explaining her involvement with the Coterie. Your eyes catch her shifting uncomfortably in her seat at the mention of the organization’s name.\n"
"“The Coterie is involved with a great many things all over the world, as you likely already know,” she says, choosing each word delicately, “but their—our—goals are not so different from your own. I have spent many years as a researcher for the organization, searching for the very same things your employers seek. Objects of arcane power that can be used to defend humanity from the threats we cannot see.”"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or to control humanity, you note aloud.\n"
"Ms. Şahin sighs. “You are not wrong. But I assure you not all of us within the Coterie would use them for such purposes. There are those, like myself, who wish only to use them for the good of others.”\n"
"You ask Ms. Şahin why you should trust her, given the actions of the Coterie in other places around the world.\n"
"“Ours is not an organization with a leader or a hierarchy,” she explains. “We operate independently in furtherance of a unified goal. But some…” she swallows hard with a shudder. “Some employ methods I do not agree with. Methods which disgust and, if I am being wholly honest, terrify me.”\n"
"You still don’t know if Ms. Şahin is telling the truth, but there’s no point in not hearing her out. You ask her what the situation in Constantinople is, and why she has sought an audience with the Foundation. “Istanbul,” she corrects you. “The people of Istanbul no longer refer to this city by that name.” You make a note to yourself to refer to the city only as Istanbul from here on out. “One of the relics you have been searching for is here, in Istanbul. It is one I have been seeking for many years, a talisman bound to a powerful entity, what some might call a ‘jinni.’ Or in the traditional sense, the only kind of non-human entity with the capability to exercise free will.”\n"
"Judging from Ms. Şahin’s clinical definition, you wonder aloud if Ms. Şahin believes this to be true. “A jinni? No, I do not believe this talisman is bound to a jinni. I suspect its master is something even more powerful and inhuman. Something not of Earth at all. And the two of us are not the only ones looking for it. After the Great War and the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire, many records were thrown into chaos, but many more emerged from obscurity, including those pertaining to this talisman. The other group searching for it… the things they have done in search of this knowledge…” her face pales, and she struggles to keep her composure. “They’ll do anything to get their hands on it. Murder and torture are just tools to them. I hate to think of what sort of heinous acts these villains would commit if they managed to obtain it. And the worst part is, I believe one of my cohorts may be the one pulling the strings. I am so close to finding it, but if they find it first…”\n"
"You understand now why Ms. Şahin came to you—if one of the Coterie is behind this cult’s actions, she could not go to them with this information. Still, lingering doubt toils in your mind. “Please,” she pleads with you. “Find the talisman before this cult does. I do not wish to see what entity it is they worship. I’ll do what I can to help you if you place the talisman into my care afterward. In return, I promise never to relinquish it to the control of the other… more dangerous members of my organization. It will remain safe and tethered in my control. I cannot guarantee the same should you wield it yourself. Please, we are on the same side, I assure you.”"

"Ece lets out a long breath, visibly relieved. “Thank you. I will admit, I wasn’t sure if I could trust you. It is a comfort to know that our two organizations can work together when lives are at stake. After all, we share the same goal.” She rises to her feet and shakes your hand.\n"
"You ask Ms. Şahin where you should begin searching. “The last written account of the talisman’s existence was during the city’s conquest in the 15th century. It was likely hidden in order to keep the invading Ottomans from finding it. After that, it remained hidden for many long years. It was naught but a fable, spoken of in hushed voices and whispers. But due to recent events… well, it would not surprise me if the recent Allied occupation of the city had something to do with this sudden interest in finding it. But let us not get buried in conjecture. I would begin looking in places that were not sacked by the conquering army. The university may also be a useful resource for you. As for me, I am not particularly helpful in a fight, if it comes to that. But I can provide you with aid, in my own way.”"

You feel a pang of guilt for deceiving her, but you can’t allow the Key to land in the hands of anyone else. Ms. Şahin may yet still be a wolf in sheep’s clothing.\n"

"“I see.” Ece’s face falls, downcast. “I was truly hoping our two organizations could work together. After all, we share the same goal. But…” she sighs. “I suppose your honesty is still appreciated. After all the scheming and plotting, I prefer that to the alternative.”\n"
"You ask where this puts the two of you, hoping you won’t have to fight a war on two fronts. “Look. I was telling you the truth. I only want to prevent the talisman from falling into the hands of those who would use it to harm humanity. I hope that I put my trust in the right people, but if you’re unwilling to keep it in my protective custody…” She fidgets with her pen. “For all I know, you’re here for the same reasons they are. I won’t get in your way, but… I cannot in good faith help you if you intend to keep the Key without supervision.”\n"
"You try to protest, but you don’t have much of a leg to stand on. You chose not to trust her, so her decision not to trust you is equally valid. Of course you would only use the Keys you acquire to protect humanity, but you have nothing other than your word to give her. “Your best bet is to start your search in places that were not sacked when the Ottomans invaded the city in the 15th century. The university may also be a useful resource for you.”\n"
"She stands and escorts you to the door, wishing you luck. The door shuts behind you without another word."

You’ll do anything to get your hands on the Keys, won’t you?” You protest—it’s not that you want them for yourself, it’s just that you need to keep watch over them.
