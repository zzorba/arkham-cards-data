"\"When the world ended, the various scientific and mining communities of different nationalities that lie in the asteroid belt between the planets Mars and Jupiter had formed a pact — a promise to ensure the survival of mankind. […] The United Colonial Coalition is composed of twenty colonies, varying widely in size, population, and purpose. Some colonies exist solely for mining, while others focus on scientific research or are engineering centers; these usually have fewer than 200 individuals living within them. Other asteroids serve as population centers, containing vast hydroponic farms, universities, and recreational areas. These can be home to more than a thousand colonists…\"\n"

"When you arrive at the asteroid, you are absorbed by the fuchsia glow of Elbrus. Quantum materials have only recently been discovered, but may hold key properties that could be used to engineer devices that would have been impossible with classical materials. Unfortunately, quantum fields generated by these materials disrupt traditional radio communication, making it impossible for you to hail the scientists on Elbrus. Without further ado, you and your companions board one of the landing crafts and drift towards the asteroid…\n"
"The purple aurora spreads over the viewport like distant milk, filling the room with an electric tinge. Your final approach vector takes you directly over one of the larger craters on the asteroid. The computer calculates the trajectories, and commences the final descent onto the rocky surface. It is just then that the short-range radios crackle into a man's terrified voice. \"Abort the landing procedure now! Abort! Before —\" But it is too late. The warning lights begin flashing on and off as the craft spins out of control. You grab onto anything you can, but the vessel increasingly spins and spins until your arms flail and darkness prevails…"

When a location enters play, regardless of if it has been in play at a previous time, treat it as if you have just revealed it for the first time. As such, a number of clues equal to that location's clue value are placed on that location each time it is revealed (from the token pool)."

msgid "When you finally came back to your senses, you and your companions were inside the Tatterdemalion, and Elbrus appears to have disappeared — possibly lost in space and time within the quantum realm. You don't remember much of what happened. Despite the initial evidence pointing to the contrary — proof was eventually found that the ordeal has been real — shards of the quantum-behaving crystals were discovered in the cargo bay, that you presumably have brought back from Elbrus. Still unsure of why the cultists have come, you prepare for the next destination, which may finally give a few answers rather than pose more questions."

"The physicist is more than grateful for your help. \"All this vital research — thank god you came in time. If you ever need to get something done in the Colonial territories, I'll make sure to put in my good word.\" With a nod and an awkward handshake, you depart the facility and return to the Tatterdemalion. The cultists have stolen the quantum shards from Elbrus, but for what purpose, you are still unsure.\n"
"You look into the ephemeral glow of the crystal shard Erwin has gifted you, wondering about the bizarre circumstances you have found yourself in. However, there's no time to waste on self-reflection — K2-PS187 awaits your next heading."

msgid "A few moments after you return to the Tatterdemalion, Elbrus implodes in a cacophony of ephemeral haze and pops out of existence. The physicist sighs in relief. \"Thank god you came in time. It's a shame about all that research that was lost, but at least everyone is safe. Now please explain to me why we are now in the very ship I remember came to pillage our facility.\" You brief Erwin on your quest and discuss what purposes the cultists could have had with the quantum shards. The physicist proposes several ideas of quantum weaponry or tools - but none of which makes any sense. Regardless, he is willing to join you on your quest — out of good will or curiosity, you are unsure. Still unsure of why the cultists have come, you prepare for the next destination, which may finally give a few answers rather than pose more questions."
