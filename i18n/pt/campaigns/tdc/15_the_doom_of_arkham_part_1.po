"You awaken from yet another nightmare to a furious knocking at your door. You open it to find a bedraggled looking Andy and Ruby, along with a sharply dressed inspector who introduces himself as John Raymond Legrasse. The inspector explains that he has been investigating a spate of dreaming cults across the United States and abroad.\n"
"You invite them inside as it begins to rain. Once seated, the inspector flashes a photo of a familiar statue. Several months ago, he sent the statue to a colleague in Miskatonic University for analysis. Apparently, Tillinghast's request that you find his \"missing shipment\" was nothing more than petty theft. He tells you he arrived in Arkham about a month ago to interrogate Tillinghast and recover the statue.\n"
"\"Something didn't sit right with me after we handed off the artifacts,\" Andy says darkly. \"So a few days later, I headed to the shop. When we got there the shop'd moved. Or so we thought. Ruby finally found it, and we went in to find the inspector arguing with Tillinghast and—things didn't go so well.\"\n"
"\" That's putting it mildly,\" Legrasse says. \"Randall was giving me the runaround when these two appeared. He threw us out, real quick. When we looked around, we weren't… here.\" You ask him what he means, and he shakes his head. \"I mean we <i>weren't here.</i> In Arkham. His shop door led somewhere else entirely. It took us a whole month to return\"\n"
"\"I think we were somewhere in Tibet, or even farther north. It was… a journey to get back,\" sighs Andy. A few months ago, you might've found their story hard to believe, but not now. Knowing what you do about Tillinghast, it's no surprise that he has something far more sinister planned than simple acquisition. But what?\n"
"Together with Inspector Legrasse, Ruby, and Andy, you resolve to recover the artifacts and confront Tillinghast, wherever he might be. As you set out,the rain turns to a heavy downpour."
