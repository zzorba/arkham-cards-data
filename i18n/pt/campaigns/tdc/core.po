"Aan additional cost for a card with the seal keyword to enter play, its controller must search the chaos bag for the specified chaos token and place it on top of the card, thereby sealing the token.

"A sealed chaos token is not considered to be in the chaos bag, and therefore cannot be revealed from the chaos bag as part of a skill test or ability.\n"
"When a chaos token is \"released,\" it is returned to the chaos bag and is no longer considered sealed. <b>If a card with one or more chaos tokens sealed on it leaves play for any reason, any chaos tokens sealed on it are immediately released</b>.\n"
"Some cards (with or without the seal keyword) may also have abilities that seal one or more chaos tokens as part of their effect. This is done following the same process as above: searching the chaos bag for the specified token, removing it from the chaos bag, and placing it on the card. If the specified token is not in the chaos bag, the effect fails."
