msgid "The sound of crackling electricity greets you as you enter the undersea dome. Flooded trenches and crumbling ruins cover the round plaza on the seafloor. Try as you might, your eyes keep drifting to the ocean beyond the alien barrier. A bloom of jellyfish floats dreamily through the tenebrous depths. If the energy field were to disappear for any reason, the expedition would surely be swept away."

"“I think this is the source,” Andy points to the round structure in the center of the plaza. Bolts of electricity lick the shimmering bubble above. The structure is the source of the glow and, presumably, the energy field protecting these ruins from the ocean water. Inside, you find a spinning orrery: a complex mechanism of hovering spheres and whirring gears that stir a constant electric current. Locked at its core is an incandescent orb. Andy fidgets nervously. “It’s powering the machine. I don’t know what’ll happen if we take it out but… it looks like something Mr. Tillinghast would want.”\n"
"Before you can object, he sets to operating the ancient controls. There may be a way to remove the orb without drowning…"

"You follow the expedition past pits of deep water and sunken ruins to the source of the glow and, presumably, the energy field. Inside it, you find a spinning orrery: a complex mechanism of hovering spheres and whirring gears that stir a constant electric current. Locked at its core is an incandescent orb. Ruby gasps. “It’s some kind of pumping station. I’d wager that orb is an important part of it. It’s possible that stealing it could bring the ocean down on our heads.” She smiles rakishly. “So you’d better be ready to run.”\n"

"Your head spins as you look up at the alien orrery. The sight brings you back to that first night, the night Tillinghast took you off the streets. The stars that night were bright, and you can't forget their particular formation, the same formation in front of you now. Away from the constant grind and concerns of your life in Arkham, you've done some thinking. Tillinghast's words were kind, but his tone was harsh, cold, unfeeling. Reflecting on it, you have only garnered the businessman's attention when you were useful. There was no kindness in his act, when he saved you, he acquired you as yet another lackey in his quiver of debtors.\n"

The expedition looks on in a mixture of awe and fear as a torrent of seawater reclaims the alien structure. A small prick of pain shoots through your palm, and you look down to see the node bury itself in your palm, sending spidery black hairs radiating out under your skin. They retract painlessly when you pull the node away. Tillinghast will certainly be pleased with this find."
