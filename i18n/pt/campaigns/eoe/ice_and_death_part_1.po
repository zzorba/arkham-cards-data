"After two weeks and many hours of hard work, the expedition is ready to make its first foray into the cold, dead continent of Antarctica. Ms. Takada, along with two other mechanics, have fully assembled three aeroplanes along the flat ice shelf—a perfect place for takeoffs and landings. Your team congregates by the aeroplanes, along with several days' worth of camping equipment. The plan is to fly two of the planes over the vast jagged peaks, taking aerial photographs of the stone city mentioned in Dyer's account… that is, if such a thing really exists.\n"
"\"If we can find a safe landing zone, we will set up a temporary outpost,\" Dr. Kensler explains. \"Dyer, Danforth, Fredericks, and Claypool will stick around while the rest of us head back to base camp. We can use the sledges to ferry supplies to and from the camps. Otherwise, we'll simply scout out the area and head back to base camp.\" The team nods in agreement and begins boarding the planes."

"\"Buckle up,\" you tell the others as you spin the propeller and hop into the pilot's seat. You motion to the pilot of the other plane, and both of you start your engines. One at a time, you take off from the ice shelf and soar into the opaque fog. You have never flown a plane of this size, but but it's no match for your piloting skills. Within moments you have a handle on the beast's clunky controls. The weather is another matter entirely. The rough Antarctic winds and harsh fog make for poor flying conditions. The deeper you head through the beautiful and deceptive polar mirages, the more you struggle to keep a handle on the aeroplane.\n"
"Dr. Kensler peers out a window as you pass a magnificent view of distant mountains like vibrant, enchanted castles floating above the clouds. \"They're beautiful,\" she remarks quietly.\n"
"\"These are nothing,\" Dyer begins, \"Wait until you see-\" And then the storm hits. The winter winds are so sudden and fierce that they almost force you out of your seat. Both planes shunt to and fro in the horrid winds, and you hear several of the passengers shouting behind you.\n"
"\"What in the hell?\" Fredericks grunts.\n"
"\"We have to head back!\" Claypool shouts. \"These winds will force us down if we keep going!\"\n"
"\"We're so close!\" Dr. Kensler growls bitterly.\n"
"\"We don't have a choice!\" he yells back, but it's too late. The plane lurches toward the ground, and you struggle in vain to regain control. All of the passengers notice the dark shape in the sky at the same time you do. It is a massive shadow, like a curtain drawn across the mountains, or perhaps the tattered wings of an antediluvian behemoth. It scowls at you with dreadful, hollow eyes. Then it reaches out, and—"
