"<center><b>Four Missing, Whereabouts Unknown</b></center>\n"
"\n"
"Residents of French Hill are still in a tizzy after the sudden disappearance of several guests and house staff from the home of Mr. Josef Meiger during the night of the annual Silver Twilight charity gala last Sunday. “We are absolutely baffled as to how this could have happened,” said Mr. Meiger the day after the disappearances. “That said, we are confident that Sheriff Engle and the Arkham Police will do their due diligence in finding the missing persons.”\n"
"There is still no evidence whatsoever as to the whereabouts of Miss Gavriella Mizrah, Mr. Jerome Davids, Mr. Valentino Rivas, and Mrs. Penny White, all of whom vanished halfway through the event and have not been seen since. The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.\n"
"So far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”\n"

"You fold up the newspaper and shove it aside on your desk, examining the other files you’ve collected over the last few days concerning the missing persons. It has been several days since your experience in the woods. You have tried to put it all out of mind, but it is impossible. Every night, you dream of a nameless place in the void of space, a faint discordant melody of hypnotizing flutes pulling you forward. Now there are others disappearing from the town without a trace. The disappearances dance along the edges of your thoughts. <i>No reason to worry</i>, you ponder, turning the man’s words over in your head. You think of the card reader and her warning, and you wonder if you are simply imagining devils where there are none. Regardless, there is only one way to know for sure. You pick up the invitation, examining the silver-embossed stationary and perfect calligraphy.\n"

"As you prepare for the night ahead, you cannot help but wonder: Are you taking action to remedy your fate, as the soothsayer advised? Or are you walking willingly into the jaws of a grim destiny?"

msgid "The entry hall to the manor is beautifully decorated, but you find it odd that the grand staircase’s wooden balustrade has been recently repaired and, by the looks of it, hastily so. While nobody is looking, you follow the handrail up and down the stairs until you spot what you are looking for: several splinters of wood, perhaps dislodged by a bullet. You ascend the staircase once more and position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun. A gun was indeed fired in the entry hall of the manor—but if that is true, how did nobody hear the shots?"

msgid "Josef Meiger’s personal office is pretty tidy for somebody whose personal secretary just went missing. Perhaps he’s just a fastidious person…or perhaps he’s been scrubbing evidence of some wrongdoing. You find nothing of note in any of Josef’s files, but after some perusing, you realize there is one place you haven’t checked: the trash. Rooting through the garbage bin yields fruit. Near the bottom is a small pocket journal belonging to Jerome Davids, probably tossed there carelessly by the cleaning staff. You turn to the last page. There, Jerome had recorded a list of names, perhaps transcribed from Josef ’s records. You don’t know what it means yet, but it must be important."

msgid "Are there no clues on the Balcony?"

msgid "The balcony outside Josef Meiger’s bedroom overlooks the rainy streets and somber spires of French Hill. According to eyewitnesses, Penny was last seen entering Josef ’s bedroom, presumably to tidy it up, or perhaps to look for one of his personal belongings. The cigarette butt on the floor of the balcony tells a different story. Penny came here for a break, and judging from how busy the rest of the staff is, it was probably a much-needed one. If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help…only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up. You tuck the cigarette butt into your coat pocket, hoping it’s actually a lead and not a wild goose chase."

msgid "Tracing Valentino’s steps isn’t difficult. As the guest of honor (and life of the party, from what you hear) there was always a crowd around him. This makes the story that he “vanished when they weren’t looking” all the more unbelievable. In the billiards room, where Valentino was last seen, you corner Adam Gensler, the man he was playing billiards with just before his disappearance. “Look, I already told the cops and the reporters what I saw,” he explains, fidgeting and tapping his toes repeatedly. “Tino and I were playing billiards, I looked away, next thing I know he’s gone,” he insists angrily, returning to his billiards game. “Now where is that damned one ball?” he mutters. It might be nothing, but it looks like Valentino wasn’t the only thing to go missing that night."

"You are startled from your reverie by the sensation of something crawling up your chest, an icy hand that clasps around your throat. It grips until your breath is trapped and your windpipe starts to crack. Only there is nothing there—just a chilly draft entering the room through the open window. The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\n"
"The cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\n"
"NO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n"
"“Real or imagined, your fate approaches all the same.”"

msgid "As soon as you emerge onto the patio, you are surrounded by grim men in trench coats. Several of them reach into their coat pockets: a warning not to do anything too hasty. Before any threats can be fulfilled, the silence is broken by an icy voice. “Now gentlemen, there is no need for that.” The men withdraw to reveal an elderly man you recognize as Carl Sanford, the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. Despite the dangerous situation, his expression is almost too casual. The complete lack of fear in his posture and his actions suggests a confidence backed by substantial power. His bodyguards take several steps back, allowing you to speak with Mr. Sanford in private."

msgid "You head out of the manor and are embraced by the brisk evening air. Your investigation has left you exhausted and strangely paranoid. Something about that event felt peculiar to you, though you aren’t sure why. Although the guests seemed oblivious, you noticed that the staff was sweaty and jittery, and the Lodge members seemed tense as well. More than once, you noticed their gaze drawn to you, watching your every move. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think the Silver Twilight Lodge was having you tailed for some reason. Regardless, you weren’t able to find much information about the four disappearances, and you doubt you ever will. Perhaps it was nothing, after all."
msgstr ""

msgid "You flee toward the manor’s entry hall, but the wall of spectral mist still blocks your way. Emerging from the mist are several ghostly faces and arms, writhing and screaming in torment. You turn and are confronted by the empty visage of the hooded Watcher. Before you even realize your doom, the creature’s ethereal body is swirling and swooping through the air as though composed of mist itself. The creature reconstitutes before you, and its charred hand grips your throat, holding you aloft with tremendous strength. You kick and dig your nails into the creature’s hand, struggling with the ferocity of a cornered animal, but it is no use. The last thing you see is the red glare of the thing’s eyes as it drills into your mind."
