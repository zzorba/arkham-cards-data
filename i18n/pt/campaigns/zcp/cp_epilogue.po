"You tried to fight it. When the dust settled and the city recovered, you made every attempt to return to your normal life. But you aren't alive, and that's the problem.\n"
"The urges didn't bother you during the events of that fateful day. But now, in peace? At first it was accidents. A violent outburst. A broken arm. But your hunger for carnage only grew, and your will only diminished.\n"
"You told yourself you had to do it. And besides, he was a drifter - nobody would miss him. But once you had taken one life, it became all the easier to take another.\n"
"When they found your stash of bodies, you were long gone. Which brought you to your ignoble position. Squatting in the sewers, crushing rats between your teeth just to feel the blood drip down.\n"
"The light of a flashlight shines in your eyes, and you hiss up at the hulking figure holding it. As you rear up to strike, you realize the man before you has no head on his shoulders. But in one hand, he holds a head that you just barely recognize. The head begins to speak.\n"
"\"Disgusting. It's a travesty - West making us this way, then just letting us fall apart.\n"
"How do you feel about a little revenge?\""

"For the fifth night in a row, you stand in the rubble of the Brook facility. Each time with no knowledge of how you arrived, your hands caked with dirt, your muscles screaming for rest.\n"
"Tonight is different. Tonight, you stand in a darkened room, with a large sea-green tank. A red eye the size of a dinner plate focuses on you, and a voice speaks in your mind.\n"
"\"He is bound. But by our actions, he lives again. Heed the Call.\"\n"
"You fall to your knees and rejoice. What choice do you have but to answer?"

"The roadhouse is alight with chatter and music. The surviving citizens of Arkham have no need for prohibition, and plenty of cause for celebration. A black motorcar pulls up in front, and two suited men exit the vehicle.\n"
"They push through the crowd to the bar, where a large man in an apron stands pouring drinks at a back shelf.\n"
"\"Joshua Hibbert?\"\n"
"\"Call me Hibbs.\"\n"
"\"We're with the Bureau. This entire establishment is operating illegally. We're going to need you to come with us.\"\n"
"\"Sure thing fellas.\" Hibbs turns around, shotgun leveled at the agents. \"Oh, alright if I bring this along?\"\n"
"The agents look around the room to see the glares of a hundred angry townsfolk focused on them.\n"
"\"Sorry, fellas. But I think our town's had its fill of being told what to do. Maybe try some other night.\""

"\"Your crimes against our organization are severe, Doctor West.\" The shadowed faces scowl from their seats above the mousy figure, standing with a slight grin at the center of the large chamber. \"Subversion, conspiracy, murder. By all accounts, we will be terminating your employment with extreme prejudice.\"\n"
"\"However, considering your actions of exceptional merit in the events regarding the Arkham outbreak, and the significant strides made in your research, it is the opinion of this board that your past indiscretions can be overlooked. We are willing to offer you a new position as head of our facility in Manhattan.\"\n"
"\"If I acccept,\" West asks, \"I will have complete say over the direction of research for this branch?\"\n"
"\"Correct, Dr. West. Did you have plans in mind?\"\n"
"A moment of excitement flashes across Herbert West's emerald eyes. \"I think it's time we greatly expand our testing.\""
