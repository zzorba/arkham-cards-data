"You spend much of the next morning trying to understand the purpose of these runic sites. Without any photographic evidence, you have to piece together what you saw with Professor Day Morris. The relics felt more like treasures to be guarded than keys to the ritual.\n"
"Around noon, you hear a commotion from outside. Villagers in Borgarnes have gathered in the town square, petrified and pointing toward the east. An unusual, pale mist has begun to blanket the town, rolling in from the mountainside.\n"
"The professor chimes in, \"Snæfellsjökull. It all makes sense...\""

"You feel the dense fog thicken in your lungs until you simply breathe mist. Your lungs loosen and every shred of fear leaves your body. You remember old Norway, faithful King Harald, the sudden raid, and the loathesome Egil himself invading your farmland and cutting you down.\n"
"You survey the peninsula and envision yourself throttling the wretched Viking who had stolen your family's riches centuries ago. The northern lights shine above you, and you swear upon them that you will have vengeance."

"The half-troll eyes you suspiciously as you writhe on the outcropping next to the gate.\n"
"\"You... are weak... But you have suffered... to come here.\"\n"
"The gate opens inward with a loud grinding of stone and you feel warm air escape the dark recesses of the cave. You gasp it in greedily, grateful to breathe something other than the foul mist.\n"
"\"You aren't like... the hateful ones who came... before. You will prove yourselves... within... or die... as so many of the fallen... who cross Egil.\""

"\"So be it.\"\n"
"Bárðr leads you to an ancient stone gate, the thick walrus-rope dragging behind him in the snow. He begins to tap the rock methodically with his staff.\n"
"\"Egil Skallagrímsson was always the dark brother... bent by rage... greed... ambition... But even he had... a heart... Those who have come... to raise him... know only hatred.\"\n"
"You ask about the Crown of Egil, the motif you have seen across each of the runic sites.\n"
"\"Egil? A crown?\" A wry smile slowly spreads across the half-troll's face. \"No Icelander would bow to a king... nor would Egil dream of becoming... what he has always hated.\"\n"
"The gate opens inward with a loud grinding of stone and you feel warm air escape the dark recesses of the cave.\n"
"\"I trust... you will know what to do... when you meet him.\""
