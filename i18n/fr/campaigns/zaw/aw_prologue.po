"The incident was at first assumed to be a case of fatigue and paranoia.  A traveling Englishwoman by the name of Alice Liddell collapsed screaming as the train arrived at Arkham's Northside station.  Other passengers tried to console her, but Ms. Liddell was in a state of sheer panic.  \"The man dressed in newspaper… the goat and the beetle… you saw them too, didn't you?\" she plead to the onlookers, but they only shook their heads in bewilderment.  \"It's still following me, after all this distance… how far will be far enough?!\"  The young woman's panic quickly mounted, and the passengers called for the conductor to escort her off the train.  She begged them not to keep her, that she must continue her journey immediately, but her protests were ignored.  Who could believe such a preposterous story?  You yourself might have doubted her too had you not also seen these strange figures that Alice described in the brief moment before she collapsed.\n"
"You depart the train as soon as possible, but find no trace of Ms. Liddell on the platform.  Porters tell you that the police got involved and decided to take her to Arkham Asylum for temporary care.  You wrinkle your nose at the prospect of the infamous sanitarium doing her any sort of good.  Whatever Alice saw on the train must have existed, however briefly, and you must speak with her to find out what it was and why it fills her with such a powerful dread.  You head home to prepare to have an in-depth talk with Ms. Liddell.\n"
"Arkham has long been plagued by the weird, ghoulish, and arcane.  It may not have been as big a shock to you as it might have been to others, but the fact that a foreigner was affected immediately upon arriving in Arkham strikes you especially oddly.  As you gather your things at home, your mind runs over the hundreds of possible evils that could be haunting Ms. Liddell, each less pleasant than the last.  You pocket some weapons and extra materials on the offchance that you'll have to confront anything sinister.\n"
"Your own house lies across the city from the asylum, giving you plenty of time to speculate as you trek over to Arkham's downtown district.  You hope that it's just your eyes playing on your fears, but the city seems darker than it should be for a summer afternoon."
