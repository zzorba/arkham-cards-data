"Baalshandor walks the streets of Arkham. At first, the monstrous figure seems to have destroyed all of Independence Square - but as you look closer, you realize it IS Independence Square. Bits and pieces of the park and surrounding buildings form the bones of the creature you see before you, as though the flesh simply grew around them and knit itself together. This sinous evil now pursues you across the city.  Your bones ache with exhaustion. Everything that's happened over this past endless day - the facility, the procession, the First Among Many - it's all lead up to this. You steady yourself, and prepare for one last desperate fight."

msgid "You've puzzled over the being's message for hours. But now, as you look upon your destruction, the words twist in your mind. Their message is the same, but amongst them lies an incantation - the same incantation that once bound the Plaguebearer. Somehow, in your head, you know that it could prove a failsafe if there are no other paths to stop his carnage."

It's not your fault if their minds could not handle the second act. Only the strong will serve at the throne of the Tattered King. These are the thoughts that flash through your mind as the door splinters off its hinges. In moments, you will die. But this fate is acceptable, if it is the cost you pay to save all of humanity."

As you're ordered around by men in fatigues, you grin quietly to yourself and continue forward. How could you even begin to explain?You're quarantined in a massive tent with many other citizens. Though some recognize you, you doubt any are aware of the trials you've been through, and what you've done for them. Which suits you just fine. As you sit down on the sparse cot, you realize that all you've wanted for the past 30 hours is to sleep like you're dead. And that's exactly what you're going to do.\n"

"You take a shallow breath. But for once, your mind does not wander. Nothing lies at the edge of your awareness. Baalshandor is no longer bound. He is unmade. With the reagent and your own unbreakable will, you have slain the Plaguebearer. An ancient one - a God. Undone at your own hands.\n"
