msgid "Scenario III: Private Lives"

msgid ""
"Though the rain subsided while you were at the auction, the late night air is still damp and frigid.  Your mind dwells on the many possible confrontations with Wycliffe as you march briskly toward his estate in French Hill.  It's difficult to predict conversations with a man that you know so little about.  James Wycliffe isn't even a native of Arkham, having moved here from out of state several years ago.  You believe him to be a retired architect from Pennsylvania, from what the articles about his earlier expeditions stated, but it's clear that he's something more than that.  The one thing that is certain is that he knows the truth about these strange events tonight.\n"
"Wycliffe's manor slowly comes into view as you round the corner to his street.  Its design straddles the line between compliance with the French Hill aesthetic and the flair of modern art deco architecture, designed by Wycliffe himself.  Your appreciation is understandably minimal as you tread the garden path up to the front door.  You seize the brass knocker, intending to wake the whole household if need be, but the door swings open limply at first touch.\n"
"The questions that had been percolating in your mind all night evaporate in a flash.  There, just beyond the mantle in the dim light of the street lamp behind you, lies the body of James Wycliffe.  His face is frozen in a mask of terror, and it is clear from the bloodied holes in his evening jacket that his death was anything but natural.  You stand in stunned silence until a creak from the upper floor echoes down at you.  Whoever murdered Wycliffe is still here.  But why?  Your mind races through the facts until you arrive at a single new objective.  Wycliffe may be dead, but the answers to your questions must still be somewhere within his mansion.  Whether the murderers want to learn the truth for themselves or simply destroy it, you had certainly better find it before they do.\n"
"The murderers seem to know plenty about Wycliffe, but you still need to make up lost ground.  You begin at once with the corpse.  At first the body seems bare of anything but clothes, until a glint from the street lamp reflects off of Wycliffe's fingers.  A silver ring etched with strange symbols shines up at you.  Anything unusual could be instrumental in unraveling this mystery, and so you pocket the ring before beginning your search of the manor in full."

msgid "You take several minutes to study the ornate arches in the entryway.  The designs are both intricate and intriguing, a far cry from the generic engravings you see on most buttresses of this kind.  Odd symbols and images, resembling excerpts from occult tomes, adorn every inch of the stonework, though you do not recognize many of them.  What reason did Wycliffe have to include these designs?"

msgid "Among the mountains of papers, you uncover a small stack of newspaper excerpts.  The articles concern topics that you yourself would normally investigate.  Many are reports of cult activities from various newspapers around the world.  Photographs of profane idols and claims of dark influence fill each page.  Worse still are the stories of mysterious deaths from those even tangentially connected to these events.  Wycliffe has meticulously examined the articles, highlighting several passages and events that bear some resemblance to the trials you've faced tonight, particularly those concerning ancient ruins, vile fish creatures, and a malevolent deity whose followers call it <b>Cthulhu</b>.  The papers here show that Wycliffe was by no means a cultist, rather someone who had discovered this grim reality by mistake."

msgid "The hidden room appears to be as much a workshop as it is a study.  Fragments of carved stone lie scattered throughout the various drawers beside mason's tools and scientific papers.  It dawns on you as you run your fingers over one of the stones that space is bending ever so slightly around it.  Wycliffe had somehow learned how to carve the stone to hold this strange property.  Equally strangely, much of the room is covered in dust, as if it hadn't been touched in weeks.  Why did Wycliffe abruptly stop after this significant breakthrough?"

msgid "In the headboard of Wycliffe's bed, you uncover a panel in the wood that conceals a thin leather-bound journal.  Its entries cover his thoughts since he moved to Arkham, and there is a clear transition within the last two weeks where his pleasant optimism about the expeditions is replaced with a deep dread.  The short form doesn't reveal all the details you would have liked, but he writes that he has discovered the terrible truth of his former colleagues, and that he must keep the Mycenaean artifacts from them."

He would shut himself in his room for hours at a time, only emerging to seek some atlas or geographical book, but I never would have imagined that any of that would lead to…\"  The valet's voice quavers and he buries his face in his hands.  You tell him to stay out of sight until the coast is clear."

msgid "The assassins proved to be more than you could handle given the ordeals you've already undergone tonight, but you retreat from Wycliffe's manor with your life.  No amount of evidence will be of any use if you can't survive to apply it.  You bind your wounds and try to recover from the aura of madness that lingered around the estate.  Whoever – or whatever – these assassins work for holds a terrible power over the mind.  You may not fully comprehend the enemy, but you will have to pursue them all the same if you wish to dispel this conspiracy and avenge Wycliffe."
msgstr ""

"You consider yourself both lucky and unlucky that Wycliffe hid the details of this conspiracy as well as he did.  It's been an ordeal for you, to say the least, but had he not done so, the assassins might have erased the evidence before you even set foot in the manor.  Through the long hours of searching, you uncovered the key details of the plan that Wycliffe hatched to hijack his own expedition.\n"
"Wycliffe had attempted a dangerous gambit to use the O'Bannions to keep the stone away from this organization and to use you as a smokescreen.  He never intended for you to find the Mycenaean artifacts at all, but to be an excuse to keep these men off the trail.  Unfortunately for him, they found the stone and murdered him for his interference.  His gambit did pay off in a way he could have known, as you have solved his mystery and now can accomplish what he could not.  Now, you must find who controls these assassins and what they plan to do with the stone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You left no avenue unchecked in determining the truth of Wycliffe's plan.  Through your diligence and determination, you now know the full series of events that led up to the architect's murder.  Wycliffe's funding of the expeditions was done at least in part for the benefit of his former associates.  This continued until the most recent one, during which he discovered some secret and resolved to keep the artifacts out of their hands.  He hired the O'Bannions to hijack the shipment, and then subsequently hired you to both make himself appear innocent and to discourage his former colleagues from attempting to find the stone themselves.  You don't know what he intended to do with the stone after that, but he may have been banking on the O'Bannions' violent reputation to keep it safe.\n"
"Despite Wycliffe's efforts, he wasn't able to outwit your enemies for very long.  It concerns you how quickly this organization was able to act, and how many agents they fielded against you.  They seem to be everywhere, always plotting and moving.  Your thoughts flash back to the cult reports in the drafting room, and you recall the similar way that the servants of <b>Cthulhu</b> operated, always in the shadows and always ready to strike.  The gruesome fishlike creatures you battled at the riverfront lend credence to this theory.\n"
"Cult or not, the question you must now ask is where these men have taken the Mycenaean stone and just what they intend to do with it.  From what you can surmise based on Wycliffe's experiments with the stone in his study and his own architecture, the spatial warping property is central to their plan, and he likely taught them to reproduce this effect before his discovery of their secrets.  You also can guess based on Wycliffe's geographical research that their plot will culminate somewhere far from Arkham, but he hadn't figured that point out before his death.  Your only lead now is to trace where Wycliffe met with his former comrades and interrogate them yourself."

It has been an arduous night in all regards, but you can recuperate in the relative safety of day.  Rest may not come easy, but it is vital for you to be in peak condition to fight the conspiracy that still looms around you."
