"After a frantic nighttime search throughout Arkham, you have tracked down and questioned several members of the cult. Your findings are disturbing: they claim to worship a being known as Umôrdhoth, a monstrous entity from another realm.\n"
"You are able to confirm much of Lita’s story: the cult is agitated over the destruction of a ghoul lair. However, a surprising detail also turns up: the one who invaded the lair and set this night’s events in motion was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this important detail was omitted from Lita’s story—did she tell you only as much as was necessary to draw you into her conflict? But in another light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city of Arkham from a terrible menace.\n"
"The final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by one of the cultists. It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within the woods south of Arkham, this very night. According to the journal, the ritual’s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult’s dark master into this world. “If the cult is not stopped,” Lita warns, “there is a possibility that Umôrdhoth’s vengeance will consume all in its path.” Frightened but determined to stop the ritual, you head into the woods…"

"你們花了不少時間來搜索整個阿卡姆，終於在幾名異教徒成員處，問出了一些信息。你們的發現令人不安：他們聲稱崇拜一個叫做“烏默爾多斯”的神，那是來自另一個世界的龐然大物。\n"
"現在，麗塔的故事終於和線索對上了：異教徒們對於食屍鬼巢穴被破壞十分氣憤。然而事情又有點古怪：這樣一來的話，破壞巢穴，並且參與午夜行動的人，只可能有一個——麗塔·錢德勒！可為什麼呢？如果她的確做了這種事，又何必告訴你們，並與你們一起調查？難道她只是想騙取你們的信任和注意力？但是從另一個角度想，她的確是在保護阿卡姆免受災難。\n"
"最後謎團的鑰匙，在一名異教徒的日誌中找到了。裡面詳細記錄了一種儀式的執行方式，並提及舉行地點就在阿卡姆南部的森林，時間就是今晚。根據日誌紀載，當儀式完成時，地面的大門將打開，異教徒們黑暗的主人將來到這個世界。“如果不阻止這個儀式，”麗塔警告你們，“烏默爾多斯是永遠不會滿足的，它會吞噬所經過的一切。”你的心中充滿恐懼，但事已至此，只能向森林進發……"

The creature’s tendrils spread throughout the city of Arkham, searching for her. It lurks in the darkness of every corner, tugging at the seams of reality. But Lita is nowhere to be found, so the creature dwells in the shadows to this day, searching… killing."
msgstr "麗塔滿臉恐懼，他拒絕直面自己的命運，直接逃跑了。她意識到自己未能阻止儀式的進行，現在無論她去哪兒，烏默爾多斯都不會放過她的。那個生物將捲鬚佈滿阿卡姆的每個角落，拉扯現實的間隙。但麗塔已經沒了蹤影，所以那怪物一直藏身於陰影之中，不斷尋找她……只為取她性命。"

msgid "You have managed to prevent the cult from summoning its master. Although you’re unsure what would have happened had the cult succeeded, you’re relieved that—at least for the time being—Arkham is safe. You capture as many cultists as you can find, but very few townspeople believe your tale. Perhaps it was all in your head, after all."
msgstr "你成功阻止了邪教的儀式，召喚被迫中止。儘管你不太確定如果他們完成儀式會發生什麼，不過你覺得還是不要知道比較好，起碼阿卡姆會是安全的。你抓住了不少邪教成員，可惜大家還是不願意相信你的故事。也許這一切只是一場夢，誰知道呢。"

msgid "Through force of arms and strength of will, you are somehow able to harm Umôrdhoth enough to send it reeling back to the dimension from which it emerged. Warmth and light return to the woods as the void-like mass is sucked in upon itself, vanishing in an instant. You aren’t sure if a being such as this can be killed, but for the time being it seems to have retreated. As their master vanishes, the ghouls nearby climb into the open pit below, fleeing with terrible cries and shrieks. You have stopped an evil plot, but the fight has taken its toll on your body and mind. Worse, you can’t help but feel insignificant in the face of the world’s mysteries. What other terrors exist in the deep, dark corners of reality?"
msgstr "你的手腕強勁，你的意志堅定，你在烏默爾多斯身上留下了不少傷痕，足以讓它滾回異世界去了。那怪物收起了觸手，帶著刺眼的光，一瞬間消失在森林中，陽光重新灑在地面上。你不太清楚是否有辦法殺死那個怪物，但起碼現在它已經撤退了。現在它們的主人已經離去，那些地上的食屍鬼們哭嚎著逃回了地下。這一晚，你已經目睹了太多可怕的事實，烏默爾多斯的身影，將永遠折磨你的肉體和精神。更慘的是，你忍不住去想這個世界的真相是什麼。既然能夠存在這樣的怪物，那麼在現實深處的黑暗角落之中，是否還有你所不知道的其他怪物呢？"

msgid "In the face of this horror, you don’t believe there is anything you can do to stop it. You have but one hope if you are to survive. You turn on Lita and throw her at the terrible monstrosity, watching in dread as its swirling void-like mass consumes her. She cries out in torment as the life is sucked from her body. “Umôrdhoth…Umôrdhoth…” the cultists chant. Lita Chantler vanishes without a trace. For a moment, you fear that the creature will now turn on you, but you hear one of the cultists say, “Umôrdhoth is a just god who claims only the guilty and the dead. Go, and you shall be spared.” The swirling mass vanishes, and warmth and light return to the woods. The cultists slink away, leaving you alive. Lita’s last moments are forever etched upon your memory."
msgstr "面對這個世界中最黑暗的恐懼，你萬念俱灰。你最後的願望就是活著。你轉向了麗塔，將她一把推向那個恐怖的怪物，你恐懼地看著她被那團虛空的漩渦吞噬。她痛苦地哭喊，轉瞬間便失去了生命。“烏默爾多斯……烏默爾多斯……”邪教徒們的詠唱聲永不停息，但麗塔·錢德勒已經不見蹤影。有那麼一刻，你害怕那個怪物會向你衝來，但邪教徒中有一人說道：“烏默爾多斯是最公正的神，它只會帶走有罪的人和復甦的死者。走吧，你已經被神寬恕了。”說完，那怪物漸漸消失了，溫暖與陽光重回這片森林。異教徒們紛紛離開，而你們還活著。但是，麗塔死前扭曲的臉，已經永遠無法被忘懷。"
