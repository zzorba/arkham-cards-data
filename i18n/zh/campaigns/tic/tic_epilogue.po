"The drive home to Arkham is quiet. After everything you have been through, you would have thought the quiet to be a peaceful reprieve… but you are alone with your thoughts-thoughts of Innsmouth, of Deep Ones, of enormous monsters dwelling in the depths beneath the waves. You find yourself checking your rearview mirror regularly, waiting to spot the headlights of pursuers who want you dead; the glowing, unblinking eyes of an aquatic horror in your back seat; or perhaps even the cold, dead glare of Thomas Dawson, mutated nearly beyond recognition. But you see nothing. Just an empty road.\n"
"You sigh and run through the events of the past few weeks once more. You believe you have a complete picture of what occurred, and yet you still feel like there is something missing. Another gap in your memories…"

"開回阿卡姆一路寂靜。歷經種種，你只想安靜地歇一會兒……但思緒始終縈繞不去——有關印斯茅斯、深潛者，還有海浪之下、深淵之中寄居的無窮怪物。你發現自己正不斷查看後視鏡，等著裡面出現追擊者的車燈，要取你性命；等著後座出現那些水生怪物一眨不眨的發亮眼睛；又或者是死去的托馬斯·道森冰冷的凝視——他已經突變得認不出來。但你什麼都沒有看見。唯有空空的道路。\n"
"你嘆了口氣，又回顧了一番過去幾週發生的事情。你相信自己已得見全貌，但又覺得還是落下了什麼。你的記憶中還是有所缺失……"

msgid "…you shake the feeling away. It doesn't matter anymore. This whole ordeal is behind you now. Innsmouth, Dagon, Hydra, Y'ha-nthlei-just a terrible memory you wish you could forget, like all those other memories you lost. Your foot lies heavy on the accelerator. The faster you are away from this hellish place, the better."
msgstr "……你揮揮手，趕走這份思緒。但這都無關緊要了。整場禍事現在都已被你拋在身後。印斯茅斯、達貢、海德拉、伊哈·恩斯雷這些都不過是你想要忘掉的可怕記憶罷了，就像是你已經失去的其他記憶一樣。你重重地踩了一腳油門。越快離開這鬼地方越好。"

"You are back in Agent Dawson's office in Boston. He has stepped out for only a brief moment in order to retrieve some documents for you to sign. Some kind of agreement not to speak of anything you might see or hear while working for the government, no doubt. Several minutes pass. You begin to wander throughout the office, examining the many books and maps Dawson has scattered around. Some are harmless enough-a medical textbook, a history of New England, a treatise on the anatomy of aquatic creatures throughout the Atlantic-but the volumes get stranger and stranger the more of his collection you examine.\n"
"Venturing nearer to Dawson's side of the office, you notice that the many books, envelopes, and documents spread across the surface of his desk lie atop an unfolded map. You decide to chance a peek, hoping Dawson's task will keep him from his office for a while longer. Pushing some of the objects in your way aside, you examine the map. It is an enormous nautical chart of the world's oceans, marked in many spots with fresh black ink. A fountain pen lies nearby.\n"
"The marks that Dawson has made are curious, to say the least. There are over a dozen scattered across the seas. Some lie just off the coast of various continents, while others are in the middle of the ocean, their locations marked with wide, unfilled circles to show that their exact coordinates are unknown. Strange words are scribbled next to each. P'tha'wei in the north Atlantic, near Greenland. Yhe'nthalla in the south Atlantic, just off the coast of Africa. R'lyeh deep in the south Pacific. Th'all-iewa by Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean. And at least ten more, some marked with question marks-an indication that this record is incomplete. You gently push aside the book that lies atop North America and see one more just off the coast of Massachusetts. Y'ha-nthlei.\n"
"You slam the brakes and screech to a halt as your mind pulls back to the present. <i>No. It can't be.</i> Your heart twists into a knot as you realize the truth. <i>No-!</i>\n"
"Y'ha-nthlei was not the home of the Deep Ones. It was just one of many."

"你閃回到了道森特工在波士頓的辦公室。他出去片刻，去拿幾份要你簽署的文件。不用懷疑，肯定是些協議，讓你不要洩露自己為政府工作期間的所見所聞。幾分鐘過去了。你在辦公室裡踱步，檢查道森散落的書籍和地圖。有些顯然無害——醫學教科書、新英格蘭歷史，還有全大西洋的水生生物解剖論文——但你越查下去，發現的資料就越奇怪。\n"
"你小心翼翼朝著道森那一邊摸索過去，發現他的桌子上攤著一張地圖，上面堆滿了書籍、信封和文件。你決定冒險看一眼，希望道森忙於他事務，在外面再待一會兒。你將擋路的東西推開，仔細檢查地圖。這是一幅廣袤的全世界海圖，上面標出的點墨跡猶新。旁邊就放著一支鋼筆。\n"
"不得不說，道森做的標記都很奇怪。海洋上畫出的記號超過一打。有些就靠近大陸，還有些在大洋中央。具體位置都以大大的空心圓標出，以示詳細坐標尚且未知。每個旁邊還都寫著奇怪的單詞。北大西洋格陵蘭島附近的是普薩維。南大西洋靠近非洲海岸的則是耶薩拉。南太平洋深處藏著拉萊耶。東印度洋裡，澳洲海岸線上則是薩勒耶瓦。還有十多個，每個都標著問號——預示著記錄並不完備。你將蓋在北美洲上面的書輕輕推到一邊，發現還有一個記號就在馬薩諸塞州海岸邊。伊哈·恩斯雷。\n"
"你的思緒回到了現在。你猛踩一腳剎車，車子吱嘎一聲停下了。不，這不可能。你意識到了實情，心都糾作了一團。不——！\n"
"伊哈·恩斯雷並不是深潛者唯一的家園。只是眾多家園之一。"
