"Trees whizz by as you rumble along the old dirt road just outside of Innsmouth. The sun has set over the western horizon, leaving only the full moon to bathe the dusty roads in its brilliant, eerie glow.\n"
"\"Here,\" Agent Harper shouts from the passenger seat over the rumbling of the automobile engine. She points to a spot on the map she has spread across her lap, tapping it repeatedly. \"Falcon Point Lighthouse. That's where Oceiros should be.\"\n"
"A shudder courses up your spine. If your memories are to be believed, Oceiros is the man who left you to die in those tidal tunnels. You ask Harper how far Falcon Point is from Innsmouth, hoping to arrive before the Order realizes you've escaped.\n"
"She sighs. \"It's not that far, but these roads are meandering. They could be difficult to navigate. One wrong turn and—\" both you and Harper see the lights in your rearview mirror at the same time. Headlights. And they're growing larger and brighter by the second. Harper curses under her breath. \"I don't suppose those are friends of yours?\"\n"
"You shake your head and tighten your grip on the wheel. It seems the Order has already caught wind of your flight from Innsmouth. You tell Agent Harper to hold on and slam your foot on the accelerator."

"你在印斯茅斯郊外的舊土路上隆隆前行，樹木在一旁颼颼作響。太陽已降到西方的地平線上，唯有滿月還將詭異的明光灑在土路上。\n"
"“這兒。”哈珀特工在座位上叫了起來，聲音蓋過了引擎的轟響。她攤開了地圖，不斷敲擊上面的一點。“獵鷹岬的燈塔。奧賽羅思就在那兒。”\n"
"你脊背一陣打顫。要是你所記不錯，奧賽羅思就是把你扔在潮水通道裡等死的男人。你問哈珀獵鷹岬離印斯茅斯有多遠，想趕在密教發現你逃跑之前就趕到。\n"
"她嘆了口氣：“路倒是不遠，但繞得要命。找準方向可不容易。拐錯一個彎，那就——”你和哈珀同時看到了後視鏡上閃過的光點。是車燈。每一秒都越來越強，越來越亮。哈珀喘息之間罵了一句。“我想這些人總不能是你朋友？”\n"
"你搖搖頭，握緊了方向盤。看來密教已經得知風聲，明白你逃出了印斯茅斯。你告訴哈珀抓緊，狠狠踩下了油門。"

"During this scenario, the investigators are traveling the Old Innsmouth Road from Innsmouth to Falcon Point. This road is generally a straight line from left to right, but occasionally contains branching paths.\n"
"Each time a location with the Road X keyword is revealed, if there are no locations ahead of the just revealed location, put X new locations into play in a new column in front of it, Old Innsmouth Road side faceup.

Each of the remaining locations to be put into play are taken from among the set-aside Long Way Around locations <i>(if there are not enough Long Way Around locations, use as many as you can)</i>. Shuffle each of those locations so that the players do not know which is which."

"本場冒險中，調查員要沿著印斯茅斯老路前往獵鷹岬。這條路總的來說是從左到右的一條直線，但有時也會有岔路。\n"
"每當揭示了有道路X關鍵詞的地點，如果剛剛揭示的地點前方沒有地點，則將X個新地點放置入場，排成一列放在前面，以印斯茅斯老路面朝上。這些地點中的第一張必須從道路牌堆頂拿取。其餘要放置入場的地點則從放在一邊的蜿蜒長路中拿取<i>(如果沒有足夠的蜿蜒長路地點，則盡可能拿取)</i>。混洗這些地點，以使玩家無法分辨。"

msgid "<i>For example: Trish is the driver of Elina Harper's Car, and has just moved that car forward to an unrevealed location. It is a Fork in the Road with the \"Road 2\" keyword. Since there are currently no locations in front of Fork in the Road, she must therefore place 2 Old Innsmouth Road locations in front of Fork in the Road. She takes the top card of the Road deck and one of the set-aside Long Way Around locations, puts both of them into play in a new column in front of Fork in the Road, and shuffles them so that the players do not know which is which.</i>"
msgstr "<i>示例：特里希是艾蓮娜·哈珀的車的司機，剛剛將該車向前移動到一個未揭示地點。這個地點是歧路，帶有“道路2”關鍵詞。由於歧路前方現在已沒有地點，所以她必須將2張印斯茅斯老路地點放在歧路前方。她拿取道路牌堆頂的卡牌，和一張放在一邊的蜿蜒長路地點，將這兩張卡牌放置入場，在歧路前方排成一列，並混洗以使玩家無法分辨。</i>"

msgid "Generally, it is wise to avoid taking a Long Way Around, since it will slow you down and reduce the amount of time you have to reach Falcon Point."
msgstr "總的來說，避免拿取蜿蜒長路才是明智之舉，因為它會減緩你的速度，浪費你前往獵鷹岬的時間。"

msgid "<b>During this scenario, each location is connected to each location behind or ahead of it, but not to any other location on its column.</b>"

msgid "the investigators reached Falcon Point before sunrise."
msgstr "調查員在日出前抵達了獵鷹岬。"

msgid "Your drive to Falcon Point is no joyride. Between the cultists on your tail and the creatures that dwell in the woods outside Innsmouth, your vehicle is harried at every turn. With no way to escape unharmed, you are forced to abandon your vehicle and sneak through the woods on foot. By the time you see the distant lighthouse beacon, dawn already bathes the sky in orange radiance. \"Finally,\" Agent Harper groans. With no time to rest, you continue the trek to the Falcon Point lighthouse, exhausted but resolute."
msgstr "你前往獵鷹岬的路上可不輕鬆。異教徒跟在後面緊追不捨，還有印斯茅斯村外樹林裡潛居的怪物，你的車子每個轉彎都備受阻撓。它一路逃出，已是傷痕累累，你不得不丟下車子，在樹林裡用兩條腿隱秘前行。等你能遠遠瞧見燈塔的時候，晨曦已將天空映得一片橙紅。“終於到了。”哈珀特工呻吟道。但已沒有時間可以浪費，你繼續向獵鷹岬的燈塔跋涉。精疲力盡，破釜沉舟。"

msgid "You breathe a sigh of relief as you see the distant lighthouse beacon pierce the fog. \"Let's pull over here and make the rest of the trip on foot,\" Harper suggests. \"If there's anybody still in that lighthouse, it would be best if they didn't hear us approach.\" Her advice is sound. You're not sure what to expect once you reach Falcon Point, but all signs point to it being another outpost for the Order. You double-check to make sure you aren't being followed, then pull over by the side of the road. Gathering your belongings from the car's trunk, you begin the trek to the Falcon Point lighthouse…"
msgstr "你穿越濃霧，終於瞧見了遠遠的燈塔，不禁鬆了口氣。“咱們把車停在這兒，剩下的路用走的吧。”哈珀建議道，“要是還有人在燈塔裡，最好不要讓他聽見我們來了。”她的建議十分穩妥。你可不敢確定在獵鷹岬會遇上什麼，但所有的跡象都表明這裡是密教的另一處據點。你再三確認自己未遭跟蹤，然後把車停在路邊。你從車箱裡收齊自己的東西，開始往獵鷹岬的燈塔跋涉……"
