"The rumbling of the boat's engine startles you from your thoughts. \"Yeh all right there?\" the ship's captain growls. \"Yeh look like ye've seen a ghost. Pale as a sheet, yeh are.\"\n"
"You turn and face the grizzled old man. Mr. Moore was the only ship captain you could find in Innsmouth who was unafflicted by whatever curse or deformity has gripped most of the town. His apparent humanity, however, has done nothing to spare his broken teeth, crooked jaw, or the massive scar torn down his right cheek. Still, he is a welcome sight, considering the way the rest of your investigation has gone.\n"
"\"Can't believe you want to head to that accurs'd Devil Reef,\" he exclaims, shaking his head. \"It's a fool's errand.\"\n"
"You point out that the sailor was happy enough to provide passage after you showed him his payment, earning a raspy chuckle out of him.\n"
"\"Yeh got me there,\" he admits. \"Now get ready. We set off in ten.\" He stumbles from the main deck into the bridge to chart a course while you prepare for the journey ahead."

"船隻的引擎聲將你叫醒。“都還好嗎？”船長吼道，“你看上去跟鬼一樣的。臉白的跟紙一樣的，你啊。”\n"
"你轉過來朝著頭髮花白的老人。你在印斯茅斯只能找到摩爾船長還肯載你了。無論是詛咒還是異形，都已攫住了大部分村子。但摩爾卻不為所動。他顯然還是個人類——儘管他牙齒缺損，下巴扭曲，右邊臉上還撕開一道大疤。但想到你這一路的調查都看到了什麼，能見著他還是令人舒心。\n"
"“真沒法子信你要去那倒霉催的魔鬼礁石。”他搖著頭大聲喊道，“呆子才這麼做。”\n"
"你向船長指出，自己給錢之後，他可開心載你一程了。這惹得他發出一陣刺耳的怪笑。\n"
"“你倒是講到點了。”他承認道，“現在做好準備。我們十分鐘後出發。”他從主甲板上踉踉蹌蹌地爬上艦橋，測定航行，而你則在準備前方的征程。"

"Agent Dawson boards the ship at last. He sports a heavy overcoat and carries a shotgun slugged over his shoulder. \"Agent Harper had a cache with some extra firepower,\" he explains. \"I figured, given the rumors, it couldn't hurt.\"\n"
"You know what rumors Dawson refers to: Devil Reef is supposedly haunted, or perhaps infested, with some manner of devilish sea creature. The sailors of Innsmouth speak of silhouettes crawling in and out of caves along the reef's many islands, of strangely misshapen fins sighted along the surface of the sea, and of entire boats crashing against the jagged rocks and vanishing beneath the waves.\n"
"\"All of our research has led to this. Whatever is going on in this town, the Esoteric Order of Dagon and this 'Devil Reef' are at the heart of it. Agent Harper suspects these rumors were spread by the Order to keep sailors away from the reef. If that's true, there must be something the Order is hiding.\"\n"
"You ask where Harper is, and Dawson shoots you a hard glance. \"She has her mission. We have ours.\" You remind Dawson that you've already accomplished the mission you were hired to perform, which yields a smirk from the hardened vet. \"True. And yet here you are.\"\n"
"He has a point. You could have left right after Harper was rescued, but you stayed to assist with their investigation. Perhaps out of a sense of duty, or perhaps curiosity. Whatever it was, you're here now, and there's no going back."

"道森特工最後一個上船。他得意地穿著一件厚外套，肩膀上拖著一把霰彈槍。“哈珀特工藏了一些額外的武器。”他解釋道，“考慮到那些流言，我估摸著，帶上可沒什麼壞處。”\n"
"你知道道森特工說的“流言”指的是什麼：怕是有某種邪惡的海洋生物縈繞著——或者說感染了魔鬼礁石。印斯茅斯的水手提過礁石洞穴內外匍匐的輪廓，或是在海面上見過奇形怪狀的魚鰭，要麼就是整艘船都撞在犬牙交錯的亂石間，消失在波濤之下。\n"
"“我們所有的研究都指向這裡。無論村子裡發生了什麼，都指向了達貢密教和這‘魔鬼礁石’。哈珀特工懷疑密教散播這些流言，就是為了讓水手遠離這塊礁石。要真是如此，那密教肯定在隱藏什麼。”\n"
"你問哈珀特工在哪兒，而道森只回你一個冷峻的目光。“她有自己的任務。我們也有我們的。”你提醒道森特工你已經完成了自己受僱的任務，但這只把堅毅的老兵逗笑了：“確實。但你怎麼還在這兒呢。”\n"
"他說到點子上了。救出哈珀特工後你就可以走的，但你還是留了下來幫助他們調查。也許是出於責任感，又或者是因為好奇心。無論如何，你都在這兒了，並且無路回頭。"

"Agent Dawson boards the ship at last. Heavy bags uner his weary eye. \"All of our leads are cold,\" he says with resignation. \"Wherever Agent Harper is now, she's beyond our reach.\"\n"
"You attempt to console Dawson by reminding him why you've chosen to investigate Devil Reef. The rumors say it is haunted, or perhaps infested, with some manner of devilish sea creature. The sailors of Innsmouth speak of silhouettes crawling in and out of caves along the reef's many islands, of strangely misshapen fins sighted along the surface of the sea, and of entire boats crashing against the jagged rocks and vanishing beneath the waves.\n"
"\"You're right,\" Dawson admits with a sigh. \"Whatever happened to Agent Harper has something to do with the Esoteric Order of Dagon. That book that was slipped under your hotel room door is evidence enough of that. And if my hypothesis is right, the ones who have been spreading these rumors about Devil Reef are none other than the Order themselves. If that's true, there must be something they're hiding.\"\n"
"You nod and begin preparing for the mission. Agent Dawson gazes at you inquisitively the entire time. \"Why did you stay?\" he finally asks. \"You could have left Innsmouth after we failed to rescue Agent Harper, but you chose to stick around. Why?\"\n"
"Truth be told, you aren't sure. Perhaps it was a sense of duty. Perhaps it was curiosity. You shrug and tell him it doesn't matter. You're here now, and there's no going back. Your admission earns you a smile from the hardened vet.\n"
"\"Right. Let's go find what they're hiding,\" he says."

"道森特工最後一個上船。他疲憊的雙眼下掛著沉重的眼袋。“我們的線索都斷了。”他頹唐地說道，“無論哈珀特工現在在哪，我們都找不到了。”\n"
"你試著安慰道森特工，提醒他你們為何要來調查魔鬼礁石。流言說有某種邪惡的海洋生物縈繞著——或者說感染了魔鬼礁石。印斯茅斯的水手提過礁石洞穴內外匍匐的輪廓，或是在海面上見過奇形怪狀的魚鰭，要麼就是整艘船都撞在犬牙交錯的亂石間，消失在波濤之下。\n"
"“你是對的。”道森嘆了口氣承認道，“無論哈珀特工發生了什麼，看肯定和達貢密教有關。那本滑進你房間的冊子就足以證明。要是我所料不虛，散佈魔鬼礁石流言的人肯定是密教的。要真是如此，那他們肯定在隱藏什麼。”\n"
"你點點頭，為任務做準備。道森特工一直好奇地望著你。“你為什麼留下來了？”他終於問道，“營救哈珀特工失敗後，你就可以離開印斯茅斯的，但你還是在這轉悠。為什麼？”\n"
"說實話，你自己也不確定。也許是責任感。也許是好奇心。你聳聳肩，告訴他這不重要。你都在這兒了，並且無路回頭。你的磊落把堅毅的老兵逗笑了。\n"
"“嗯。讓我們一起找出他們到底在隱藏什麼。”他說道。"
