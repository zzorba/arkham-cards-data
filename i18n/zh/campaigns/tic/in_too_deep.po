"The sea rises steadily as you make your way along the coast toward the town of Innsmouth. The sun and moon align over the distant horizon, threatening a grim, uncertain future.\n"
"You remember the layout of the town and several strange faces you met during your first few days there, but nothing that transpired between then and waking up in that waterlogged pit. Agent Harper has been trying to fill you in, but with so many gaps in your memory, each explanation only perplexes you further.\n"
"\"Ever since you came to Innsmouth, things have only gotten worse. It began with the locals. Each day, they got rowdier and more hostile, especially to outsiders like you and me. Do you remember how nauseating some of them looked? Slimy, grayish skin? Wide lips, bulging eyes, that sort of thing?\"\n"
"You nod. Now that you've remembered, you almost wish you hadn't. It wasn't just the way they looked, either. Their hoarse voices croaked syllables barely resembling human speech, and they reeked of rotting fish.\n"
"\"They're the ones who've been stirring up trouble recently. And that's not all. There are other creatures skulking around Innsmouth of late. I'm sure you've seen them, too.\" She shudders. \"There's some kind of connection between the Esoteric Order of Dagon and those… things. Not sure what yet, but we'll get to the bottom of it if—\"\n"
"Agent Harper's voice trails off as she climbs to the top of the headland. Whatever has her staring agape can't be good. You reach the top, haul yourself over the ridge, and see the same devastation she does.\n"
"Innsmouth has been invaded. The same creatures you encountered in that sacrificial pit prowl the street—foul things from the depths of the sea, or perhaps beyond. They patrol the alleys and intersections, searching for something. Hunting. Makeshift barricades block the various pathways through the town as water from the Manuxet River spills out onto the streets.\n"
"\"No, this can't be…\" Agent Harper intones. A moment of silent gloom hangs between you. It is clear that Innsmouth is no longer safe. You inform Agent Harper that Agent Dawson left his vehicle near hers, at the abandoned railway station on the western edge of Innsmouth. She nods, understanding. \"Right. We have to get to the other side of town, and fast.\"\n"
"The sky above you is bathed in hues of violent crimson. With any luck, no more of that color will be spilled today."

"你沿著海岸朝印斯茅斯漁村前進的時候，海平面還在不斷上升。遠處的地平線上日月齊列，預示著凶險而不確定的未來。\n"
"你還記得村子的佈局，以及剛來幾天遇到的一些陌生面龐，但在那之後，從水漫金山的深坑裡醒來之前的一段事情，完全是一片空白。哈珀特工試圖幫你回想，但你的記憶中實在有太多缺失，每種解釋都只是加劇了你的困惑。\n"
"“自打你來到印斯茅斯，事情就越變越糟。先是從當地人開始。他們的粗暴和敵意與日俱增，尤其是對像你我這樣的外來者。你還記得他們之中一些看起來有多噁心嗎？那黏滑的黑色皮膚？寬大的嘴唇，腫脹的眼睛，這類東西？”\n"
"你點點頭。現在你是想起來了，但你寧願自己沒有。不僅僅是他們看上去的樣子。他們嘶啞的聲音發出的音節一點也不像人類，身上的臭氣也像臭魚。\n"
"“就是這群傢伙最近在搞事。但這還不是全部。近來有別的生物在印斯茅斯遊蕩。我確信你也見過。”她打了個寒顫，“達貢密教和這些……東西之間肯定有聯繫。儘管還不確定是什麼，但我們會一探究竟——”\n"
"哈珀特工爬上海角，她的聲音矮了下去。無論她瞪著什麼，都肯定不是好事。你也爬了上去，跨過岩脊，看到了她所見的災象。\n"
"印斯茅斯已遭入侵。你在獻祭深坑裡遇到的生物如今已逡巡在街道上——這些邪惡的生物來自深海，又或是更深處。它們在街巷和十字路口巡邏，尋找著什麼。獵殺著什麼。村子裡臨時的屏障擋住了幾條路，馬奴賽特河也漲到了街上。\n"
"“不，這不可能……”哈珀特工緩緩說道。一陣沉默的悽苦橫亙在你們之間。很顯然，印斯茅斯已經不再安全。你告訴哈珀特工，道森特工把自己的車停在了她的車附近，就在村西頭廢棄的火車站裡。她點點頭，表示理解：“嗯。我們得到村的另一頭去，而且要快。\n"
"你們頭頂的天空已是一片鮮豔的血紅。但願一切順利，你們今天莫再見血了。"

"You are in the middle of a conversation with Joe Sargent, the bus driver, but it must be several weeks earlier. The streets are not yet flooded, and all of the dilapidated, ramshackle buildings still stand, despite themselves. \"I told ye, outsider,\" Mr. Sargent says, \"There ain't no buses outta Innsmouth t'day.\" But you're not looking for a bus out of Innsmouth. You explain that you have a proposition for Mr. Sargent. He probes the street for eavesdroppers before answering. \"What kinda prop'sition?\"\n"
"You know you aren't going to get through to Mr. Sargent with a moral argument, so you appeal to his material desires instead, offering a sizable sum of money in exchange for his assistance. After returning from Devil Reef, you've found Innsmouth to be even less hospitable than normal. You are watched everywhere you go. Simply traveling on foot puts you in danger.\n"

"你知道你和薩金特說的事情見不得光，於是你想在物質上滿足他以做彌補。你提出給他一大筆錢以換取幫助。自打從魔鬼礁石返回之後，你發現印斯茅斯較之以前更不友好。你處處都受到監視。步行已成了危險的事情。\n"

"The bell over the entrance to the Little Bookshop chimes as you jerk the door open. As expected, the interior is dark. Ever since your first week in town, the shop's been closed. It seems Joyce Little was not only its owner, but its only employee. Thankfully, picking the lock wasn't too difficult. You sneak between the dark, dusty shelves as you search for anything you can find about the Esoteric Order of Dagon.\n"
"The shop is quiet, and your tail hasn't followed you here. You spend some time perusing the dark, narrow rows of shelves, until you come to a basement with a chain-locked door. There's no way you're getting that door open, but the answers you seek must lay beyond. Somehow, you have to get in there. Just then, the beam of a flashlight shines through the front window of the shop. Your tail is on to you. You flee out the back door, hoping to return another time…\n"
"… and the vision ends. You are back in the present, standing in what remains of the bookshop. Flood waters have destroyed the shelving and rendered most of the books unreadable. However, from the corner of your eye, you notice the once-locked basement door is now ajar. You rush down the steps, splashing through water up to your knees. What you find is an assortment of scrolls and tomes, many in a runic, alien, yet strangely familiar language. Whatever this trove of knowledge is, it must pertain to the Esoteric Order of Dagon. You grab as much as you can find before escaping back into the flooded streets."

"商店裡一片寂靜，你的“尾巴”現在也還沒有跟上來。你花了好些功夫在陰沉狹窄的一排排書架中尋找，最後來到了一扇鐵鏈鎖住的地窖門前。你打不開這扇門，但你要的答案一定就在下面。無論如何，你都得進去。就在這時，手電筒的光亮照過書店的前窗。追兵已至。你從後門溜走，希望之後還能回來……\n"
"……幻象消失了。你回到了現在，站在書店的殘骸中。洪水摧毀了書架，大部分的書都泡在了水裡，沒法讀了。不過，你瞥到之前鎖住的地窖門已經半開。你衝下樓梯，水漫過了膝蓋。你找到了一堆卷軸和典籍，大多用一種怪異的符文寫成，但這種語言你卻出奇得熟悉。無論其中埋藏了什麼知識，都肯定和達貢密教有關。你儘量抓起所有能帶走的東西，逃回了洪水漫過的街道。"

In the City of the Deep Ones!\" Her gaze seems to drill into the back of your skull.\n"
"You take her hand and politely detach it from your arm. It would appear you can't even walk down the street in this town without being accosted by some crackpot—and yet, something about the grievous look in her milky eyes gives you pause. Whatever this woman speaks of, she believes it with absolute certainty. Sighing, you ask her what she is talking about.\n"
"\"Th-they are on their way,\" she sputters. \"First, the alignment. Then the tide. Then the progeny of Mother Hydra.\" Her pale, blind eyes search for yours. Still, her absurd babbling is of no use to you. You are about to depart when she probes for your hand and presses something into your palm. \"Take it!\" she says. You hand it back to her and brush her off. You want no part of this foolishness; your task is to find Agent Harper, not collect bizarre knickknacks. Her expression sours as you turn to leave.\n"

"你禮貌地從她手中掙脫。看來你在這村子裡是沒法不被怪人纏上了——但她的眼白裡痛苦的神色讓你停了下來。無論這女人在說些什麼，她都篤信無比。你嘆了口氣，問她到底在說些什麼。\n"
"“它們，它們已經開始行動了。”她語無倫次，“先是天體排列成行。然後是潮水。接著就是海德拉的子嗣。”她蒼白的盲目徒勞地找尋你的身影。她這一通胡說八道對你還是毫無用處。你就要離開，但她摸索著你的手，把一樣東西塞進你的手心。“拿上！”她說道。你把東西還了回去，甩開了她。你可不想要這件蠢物。你來是要找到哈珀特工，不是為了蒐集奇怪的小玩意兒。你轉身離開的時候，她的表情一陣酸楚。\n"

"哈珀也很想離開，發動了自己的車子。但隨著引擎點火時的震動，你的腦子突然一陣疼痛。你眼前出現了光點，彷彿灼熱的太陽。“好吧，那……現在去哪兒呢？”她問道。但你已無法回應。眩目的光芒越來越強，越來越亮。引擎的轟鳴蓋過了其他一切聲響。天旋地轉。你倒在地上，緊緊捂住自己的太陽穴。你的頭火燒一樣痛。你聽到哈珀在叫你，但她的聲音壓抑沉悶，彷彿在深深的水下。又或者，在水下的是你。\n"
