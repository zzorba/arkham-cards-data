"Your plan is simple. Foolish, but simple. The knowledge you've gathered leads you to conclude that the Esoteric Order of Dagon is the cause of both the rising tides and the appearance of the horrific \"Deep Ones.\" Not only that, but over the course of the last few decades, the Order has transformed the townsfolk into more of the horrific creatures, using them to infiltrate Innsmouth from within. But worst of all, the entity the cult worships-Dagon-is just one of two. His mate, Hydra, still slumbers in the depths below Innsmouth, waiting to awaken and stake her claim over an endless ocean.\n"
"These are the conclusions that have led to your plan: Travel once more to Devil Reef, descend into the city of the Deep Ones that lies hidden at the bottom of the ocean, and put a stop to the Deep Ones' plans once and for all. Agent Harper helps you prepare, loading your possessions onto the boat you managed to steal from what remained of Innsmouth's docks. \"We only have one shot at this,\" Harper says. \"I don't think I need to remind you what might happen if we fail.\" She looks pointedly at the flooded ruins of Innsmouth. \"Are you ready?\""

"你的計劃非常簡單。愚蠢，但是簡單。你總結收集的情報，得出的結論是：無論是浪潮漸起，還是可怕的“深潛者”現世，都是因為達貢密教作祟。不僅如此，在過去的幾十年間，密教還將村民變得不再像人，更像是那種可怕的生物，利用他們從內部滲透整個印斯茅斯。但最糟的是，密教崇拜的神靈——達貢，竟然還有同類。他的伴侶，海德拉，依然在印斯茅斯底下的深淵沉睡，等候甦醒之日，將無盡的海洋盡數攫於掌心。\n"
"你由此得出了自己的計劃：再去一趟魔鬼礁石，深入海底潛藏的深潛者之城，一勞永逸地終結深潛者的計劃。哈珀特工幫你準備，從印斯茅斯港口的殘餘中偷來一艘船，將所有的東西都放在了船上。“我們只有一次機會。”哈珀說道，“我想用不著說，要是我們失敗了，會有什麼下場。”她直截了當地望向印斯茅斯已經淹沒的廢墟。“你準備好了嗎？”"

"You are deep below the Esoteric Order of Dagon's headquarters once more, emerging from the hall where you had disrupted the Order's ritual. You follow Agent Dawson through a series of winding, flooded corridors flanked by statues of aquatic monstrosities and malformed beasts. You ask Dawson where exactly you're headed, but he doesn't reply. Finally, you enter another chamber, similar to the last. Its walls are covered in otherworldly effigies and a depiction of ocean waves swirling below an alignment of celestial bodies. Another familiar pool dominates the cavern, inside which the dark shape of something massive slumbers. To your surprise, Agent Harper stands in front of the pool, gazing into its dark reflection. She turns with a start when she hears you approach, relaxing only once she sees who you are. \"Is it done?\" Dawson asks.\n"
"She nods. \"This one isn't waking up anytime soon.\"\n"
"\"Good. The Order is on to us. We have no time to spare. Let's get to the vault and take what we came for.\"\n"
"You reel. What exactly is going on here? Both of the agents notice your confusion at the same time. A moment of grim understanding dawns as you realize the truth of the situation. The agency didn't come here to investigate criminal activity in Innsmouth at all. They came here for something else. And the only vaults you've seen so far in these depths are the ones filled with archaic riches. The material wealth that has kept the town of Innsmouth afloat all these years-perhaps the very riches that persuaded so many townsfolk to follow the Order and forsake their own humanity.\n"
"Stifling your frustration, you ask how much of Dawson's briefing was a lie. \"Not all of it,\" he says calmly. \"Agent Harper was missing when I contacted you, that much was true. But she was sent here on a different mission. One we must complete this very moment or risk losing everything we've worked for. And you're going to help us.\"\n"
"You cross your arms in defiance. It's one thing to be kept in the dark by the two agents you've risked your life for. It's another to help them smuggle treasure on behalf of the government, especially when so much more is at stake.\n"
"\"I don't think you understand,\" Dawson replies, his voice surprisingly level. \"You are an asset of the agency and under my authority. You will do as I command.\" As the silence between you grows more and more tense, you spot Dawson's hand twitching toward his holstered weapon. Is he truly willing to go that far…?\n"
"Just then, you hear shouting down the hall. \"Shit. They're here.\" Dawson turns to Harper, his orders terse and quiet: \"Take the exit through Devil Reef. We'll head back the way we came. Meet up at the vault.\"\n"
"The next minute is a blur. Dawson and Harper split up. Despite your anger, you decide it is best to follow Agent Dawson, since you are familiar with the escape route. A torrent of footsteps and hollers follows close behind. You don't get far before you are cornered. An elderly man with wide, unblinking eyes and long robes blocks your exit. \"Take them,\" he says. The rest you recall only in flashes of horror. The interrogation. The dark, flooded pit. Dawson's fate. Harper discovering you on the beach-\n"
"-You turn on Harper, your vision adjusting back to the present. She seems to understand what you have seen. Her hand hovers dangerously near her handgun. \"Dammit,\" she says. \"I was hoping you wouldn't remember what happened the last time we were in this room…\" She draws in a shaky breath as the two of you silently judge one another. \"So, what now?\" she asks. \"I still have a job to do. Are you going to get in my way?\""

"你又一次來到了達貢密教總部的地下深處，你就是在那裡的廳堂裡摧毀了密教的儀式。你跟著道森特工穿越一連串蜿蜒漫長淹沒的長廊，兩側都是水生異怪和變形野獸的雕像。你問道森到底要去哪裡，但他沒有回答。你們最後來到了另一個與前處相仿的廳室。這裡牆上遍佈異界樣式的塑像，更有大幅的壁畫，畫的是星象合列之下卷起的海浪。另一個池子填滿了整座洞穴，裡面有什麼黑黢黢的龐大巨物正在沉睡。令你驚訝的是，哈珀特工正站在池子前，凝視著其中黑色的倒影。她聽到你們接近，轉而一驚，但發現是你們，鬆了口氣。“都完成了？”道森問道。\n"
"她點點頭：“這傢伙最近是不會醒了。”\n"
"“說得好。密教正在追我們。可沒剩多少時間了。快去寶庫，拿走我們該拿的東西。”\n"
"你驚住了。到底是怎麼一回事？兩位特工同時注意到了你的迷惑。你突然意識到了事情殘酷的真相。特工來這裡根本不是調查什麼印斯茅斯的犯罪活動的。他們別有所圖。迄今為止，你在這深處所見的寶庫裡都裝滿了古代的財富。這麼多年來就是這些財富在維持印斯茅斯村的周轉——也許也正是這些財富，讓許多村民追隨密教，遺忘了人性。\n"
"你藏起自己的沮喪，詢問道森所說到底有多少是謊言。“不全是。”他冷靜地說道，“我聯繫你的時候，哈珀特工確實失蹤了，這部分是真的。但她來這兒是為了別的任務。我們現在必須完成這任務，不然就會失去一直努力的一切。你得來幫我們。”\n"
"你交叉雙臂，以示反對。為了兩個把你蒙在鼓裡的特工冒盡生命危險是一回事。幫他們為政府走私財寶，又是另一回事——更別提現在有多麼危險了。\n"
"“我覺得你還是不明白。”道森語氣意外的從容，“你歸組織所有，你得聽我的。我讓你幹什麼，你就得照做。”你們之間的沉默越來越緊張，你發現道森的手伸向了皮套裡的武器。他真的要把事情弄成這樣嗎……？\n"
"就在這時，你聽到從廳室上頭傳來的叫喊。“去他媽的。他們來了。”道森轉向哈珀，悄聲簡短地下令：“從魔鬼礁石那邊出去。沿著來時的路。在寶庫碰頭。”\n"
"接著就是一片混沌。道森和哈珀分頭行動。儘管你怒火中燒，但因為你清楚那條逃脫路線，所以覺得最好還是跟著道森特工。一陣腳步聲和喊叫的狂潮緊隨其後。你沒走多遠，就陷入了包圍。一個身披長袍的老人瞪著他那不會眨的眼睛擋住了你的去路。“逮住他們。”他說道。你還能回想起來的事情就是一陣恐懼。盤問。那黑暗、淹沒的深坑。道森的命運。哈珀在海灘上發現了你——\n"
"——你的視線剛適應回到現在，轉向哈珀。看來她已經明白你瞧見了什麼。危險的是，她的手伸向了槍。“要命。”她說道，“我真希望你還是別想起來上次在這洞裡都發生了什麼……”她顫巍巍地吸了口氣。你們之間又是一陣沉默，審視著彼此。“那麼，現在怎麼說？”她問道，“我還有活要幹。你要阻止我嗎？”"
