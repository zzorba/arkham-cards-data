msgid "The brisk autumn air embraces you as you exit the manor. There is no doubt in your mind that the cast and crew of The King in Yellow have become affected by madness. Perhaps it’s getting to you, as well. You feel an encroaching darkness, a presence in your mind not unlike the gaze of the Stranger. Startled, you peer about the front yard for the first time since escaping the manor. The scene is…different. The front windows are not smashed as they were when you first approached. The trail of blood you had noticed on the porch has been wiped clean, and instead of the disturbingly warped music you had heard upon entering, the soothing tones of slow jazz drift out from the courtyard."
msgstr "當你離開這個莊園時，凜冽的秋風向你襲來。你心中確信無疑，《黃衣之王》的演職人員都被瘋狂所影響。或許這也將發生在你的身上。你感覺到一股黑暗逐漸滲入，陌生人的凝視彷彿滲入你的腦海中。驚懼之下，你逃出莊園之後首次細看前院。景像……不同了。與你第一次到來時不同，前窗並未破碎。你在門廊發現的血跡已被抹淨，與你在進入這幢建築時聽到的令人不安的扭曲的音樂不同，此時從庭院傳來的是輕柔而舒緩的爵士樂曲調。"

"“Excuse me, but it’s very late,” you hear a server say as he gently taps you on your shoulder. You realize that you are sitting on a couch in the manor’s living room, and that you have been asleep for some time. The party appears to be winding down. No music fills the halls, the food is all but gone, and only a few guests remain. “Perhaps you would like for me to get your coat?” the server asks with a trained smile. You wobble as you rise to your feet, leaning against the couch’s armrest. Your head pounds with a dizzying intensity, and your vision is spotted. You insist that you are fine, and begin walking toward the foyer.\n"
"You no longer see any of the guests you were searching for earlier, not even the hostess, Mrs. Dumaine. All traces of the madness and horror you’ve experienced are gone. Even the oddities you witnessed upon entering the manor have vanished—the signs of struggle, the broken windows, the blood trail on the porch… Every piece of evidence has been erased. But you still remember the night’s events, and in your memory you will find your answers."

"“請您原諒我的冒犯，但現在時間已經很晚了。”一位侍者輕拍你的肩膀，對你說道。你發覺你身處這座莊園的客廳，坐在沙發上睡著了一陣子。派對似乎已進入尾聲。各個禮堂都沒有樂聲環繞，佳餚消失一空，只有少數幾個賓客逗留在此。“或許您需要我給您取來外套？”侍者臉上露出職業微笑，問道。你倚靠著沙發扶手，雙腿顫顫巍巍地站起身來。你的大腦彷彿受到重擊，使你頭暈目眩，眼前的景像模糊不清。你堅稱自己無恙，然後向門廳走去。\n"
"先前你尋找的賓客已消失蹤影，女主人杜梅因夫人也不見了。你所經歷過的瘋狂和恐怖景像已無跡可尋。你進入莊園時目睹的怪事也悉數消失——掙扎的跡象，破碎的窗戶，門廊的血跡……所有的證據都被抹消了。但你仍記得這夜發生的事情，你會在記憶中找到你要的答案。"

msgid "Several days later, you find yourself reminiscing about the party you attended at 1452 Atlantic Avenue. What a roaring good time you had! And yet, your memory is hazy. You can’t help but feel you are forgetting something important. Something about the play you’d watched earlier that night—The King in Yellow. That nagging sensation pursues you in every waking moment. Try as you might to recall the night’s events in full, there remains a gaping hole in your memory. As you strain to remember, your concern grows, almost to the point of obsession. Deciding that you absolutely must know what occurred that night, you head toward the manor of the Historical Society in Southside. Perhaps there you can learn more about <u>The King in Yellow</u> play…"
msgstr "幾天過去後，你回想起你在大西洋街1452號參加過的派對。那晚你玩得真痛快！然而，你的記憶卻是模糊的。你不禁感覺到，你忘記了一些重要的事情。與你在那晚早些時候觀看的戲劇《黃衣之王》有關。在你清醒的每個時刻，這種困惑的想法揮散不去，使你不得安寧。你試圖回想起那晚發生的所有事情，然而你的記憶卻仍有一大段空白。隨著你盡力地回想，你對此事愈發專注，幾乎到了沉迷的程度。你必須知道那晚究竟發生了什麼，於是你出發前往南區的那所莊園——歷史協會。或許在那兒你會得知更多有關《黃衣之王》這部戲劇的信息……"
