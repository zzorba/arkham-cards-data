"Several months have passed since The King in Yellow came to the Ward Theatre. You and your companions have been investigating the strange incidents that followed in its wake. What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail… And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\n"
"You’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

"自從《黃衣之王》在沃德劇院上演以來，過去了幾個月。你和你的同伴一直在調查在那之後發生的怪異事件。你的發現讓你開始質疑是否調查還要繼續，但真相在呼喚著你，讓你欲罷不能。而且似乎你也不是第一批拼湊出圍繞《黃衣之王》的怪異事件的人。還有一批調查員此前也曾調查過類似事件。但這部劇在阿卡姆上演後沒幾天，他們就被送進了瘋人院，據瞭解，他們被送進去時大聲吼著王的歸來，還有攻擊他們的“怪物”。這個發現並未出乎你的意料。他們的下場讓你更加確信，你調查的方向非常正確……但也讓你更加確信，你應該馬上收手。\n"
"你找到了那些調查員在被抓去之前留下的記錄，並一路繼續追查。他們曾訪問《黃衣之王》的演職人員，並且發現了一些至關重要的信息。他們的調查筆記中也提到了阿卡姆的歷史協會，還詳細描述了他們的瘋人院裡的經歷，包括與一個名為“丹尼爾‧契斯特菲爾德”的病人的交流。你秉燭對筆記進行編錄和比較，經過漫長的一夜，你沉沉睡去。在夢中，你進入了卡爾克薩——你看到了它黑色的星辰、雙生的太陽、破碎的月球，和扭曲的尖柱。"

msgid "It has been several weeks since the events in the asylum, and you are still no closer to the truth about The King in Yellow and Carcosa. You have scoured the city for signs of the others Daniel had mentioned—the ones who are “opening the path to Carcosa”—but found nothing. Either the trail has gone cold, or they’re no longer in Arkham. Perhaps Daniel truly was insane, and you are only following him deeper down the rabbit hole. Every night, you toss and turn as you are subjected to vivid dreams of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."
msgstr "自從瘋人院事件以來，已經過去了幾個星期，但你離《黃衣之王》和卡爾克薩的真相沒有絲毫進展。你在全城搜找丹尼爾提到的其他線索——那群想要“開啟通往卡爾克薩的路的人”——但結果一無所獲。不是這條線索已經斷了線，就是這批人已經離開了阿卡姆。當然丹尼爾也可能真的瘋了，你只是被他牽著陷入了一個死局。每一晚，你都輾轉反側，在一道道鮮活的夢境中，你看到了卡爾克薩——它黑色的星辰、雙生的太陽、破碎的月球，和扭曲的尖柱。"

The Stranger reaches a solid wall of bone, and is grabbed by bony hands and pulled into the wall. Their mocking laughs reach an awful crescendo."
msgstr "你追著陌生人，走進了一條通道，這條通道由幾十萬具骷髏包裹而成，黑暗而陰冷。你往前奔跑時，顱骨齊刷刷地看著你，它們的上下頜碰撞著向你發出嘲諷的聲音。陌生人來到一堵白骨堆成的實牆面前，一群只剩白骨的手臂抓住了他，把他拖進了牆壁之中，他們可惡的嘲笑響徹整個通道。"

msgid "You find yourself inside the Arkham Police Department, desperately trying to explain to the desk sergeant what happened in the Ward Theatre. He scoffs and refuses to believe you. “We know what you’re really up to,” he says, and claps a pair of handcuffs over your wrists. “You’re under arrest for larceny. Boys, take ‘em away.” Several other cops flank you and prevent any escape. Your protests go unheard as you are firmly escorted down a flight of concrete stairs and hurled into a cold jail cell. “Maybe some time in lockup will change your story,” the desk sergeant shouts. He slams the door behind him, leaving you with your spiraling thoughts. How did they find out? How could they possibly know?"
msgstr "你突然發現自己身處阿卡姆警署，拼命在向接待警員解釋沃德劇院裡發生的事情。他卻對你嗤之以鼻，根本不相信你的話。“我們知道你幹了什麼，”說著，他掏出一副手銬就銬在了你的手腕上。“你因盜竊罪被捕了。來人，給我帶走。”其他幾個警察從四面八方包圍了你，以防你逃脫。你的抗議如石沉大海，警察死死抓住你，把你拖下一條混凝土的樓梯，扔進了一間冰冷的牢房。“也許關一段時間你就改口了。”那個接待人員吼道。他砰的一下關上了門，留下你一個人思緒萬千。他們怎麼會發現的？他們怎麼可能知道？"

A vortex of swirling black clouds looms above you, threatening to swallow the world whole. The masked man dashes through a wide set of doors atop the stairs, and you follow close behind. The sound of crashing thunder is muffled as the doors close behind you. Looking up, you see a familiar depiction in stained glass. “Beautiful, is it not?” the Stranger says quietly."
msgstr "你追著陌生人，走上了一條殘破石塊堆砌的陡峭樓梯，一路上暴雨如注，傾瀉在你的背上。遠方的天空閃著雷電。你頭頂的烏雲聚成了一個旋渦，隨時準備把整個世界都吞入其中，戴著面具的男子一個箭步竄進了樓梯頂一扇寬闊的大門，你緊緊追隨。你身後的門關上後，轟鳴的雷聲也輕了許多。你一抬頭，看見彩色玻璃上繪著一個熟悉的圖畫。“很漂亮，不是嗎？”陌生人輕輕說道。"
