msgid "Scenario VIII"
msgstr "冒險VIII"

msgid "You swim to the edge of the water and throw yourself upon the rocky shore, gasping for air. You lie there for some time, utterly exhausted. Every muscle in your body aches. Before you lies a desolate expanse of plain. In the distance, the alien spires of a warped city rise into the clouds. Behind you, the dark surface of the lake from which you’d emerged reflects the glare of two suns. When you peer back into the murky depths, you see no sign of the chapel where you’d made the leap, or of Mont Saint-Michel, or even of Earth. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."
msgstr "你游到水邊，奮力躍上岸邊的岩石，大口喘著氣。你躺下休息了一會兒，感覺精力完全被榨乾了。身上每一塊肌肉都在酸痛。你的眼前是一望無際的荒蕪平原。遠處異界的尖柱從扭曲的城中直插雲霄。在你身後是你剛剛破水而出的湖泊，黑色的湖面倒映著兩個耀眼的太陽。你回頭望向晦暗的湖底，剛才你跳躍時立足的禮拜堂已然看不到一絲痕跡，而聖米歇爾山，甚至地球，也都見不到絲毫蹤影。這就是卡爾克薩——眾星之中的瘋狂國度，哈斯塔的至高領域。"

msgid "You land on a piece of black obsidian stone winding up a dark spire. You cough blood and feel a searing pain in your gut, as though you’d broken a rib. Before you lies a warped, alien city. Its twisting streets and aberrant architecture have no semblance of order or structure. In the distance, a murky lake reflects the glare of two suns. When you look up, the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel peeks just below the clouds, flipped upside-down. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."
msgstr "你掉落到一片黑色尖柱上，柱頂為蜿蜒盤旋的黑曜石。你只覺體內一陣劇痛，好像肋骨都被刺裂了一般，咳出了鮮血。你的眼前是歪折的怪異都市。那些扭曲的街道和反常的建築物毫無規則和結構可言。在遠處，一片晦暗的湖泊倒映著兩個耀眼的太陽。你抬頭望去，聖米歇爾山上的修道院在上下倒錯的雲層中若隱若現。這就是卡爾克薩——眾星之中的瘋狂國度，哈斯塔的至高領域。"

You can scarcely bring yourself to look at it. You remember everything now—how it all began, how it ended, and everything in between. There is only one thing left to do. You hurl the mask into the air with all of your strength and watch as it flies into the tempest-tossed waves below."

"A roar of applause startles you awake. The crowd of the theatre rises to their feet, cheering endlessly. Several patrons in the front row are throwing roses to the actors on stage, who are bowing with wide smiles across their faces. A searing headache crawls through your temples. How did you get back here? Were you in the theatre all along? What about the dinner party? The asylum? The catacombs?... Carcosa? Was it all just a terrible dream?\n"
"You exit the auditorium before the crowd rushes to do the same. Dizziness and exhaustion harries your senses. The weight of your lengthy investigation is crushing your mind. By the time you finally reach the lobby, you are clawing your way across the ground. Just then, a man in an elegant suit reaches down and grabs you by your arm, pulling you to your feet. You are about to thank him when you realize who he is. The sight of him causes you to stagger backward in horror momentarily. The actor who plays the role of the Stranger is still wearing his pale, featureless mask. He gives you a wordless bow, then turns and leaves through the Ward Theatre’s front entrance."

"雷鳴般的掌聲驚醒了你。劇院的觀眾都起立駐足，他們在一個勁地喝彩。前排的幾個觀眾朝臺上的演員拋去玫瑰花，演員們的臉上綻放著會心的微笑，鞠躬致意。一陣劇烈的頭疼爬上了你的太陽穴。你怎麼會回到這裡的？難道你一直就在劇院裡？今天的晚宴怎麼了？還有瘋人院？地下墓穴？……卡爾克薩？這一切難道只是一場噩夢？\n"
"你趕在人流退場之前，離開了觀眾席。眩暈和疲憊侵擾著你的感官。你漫長的調查經歷己經壓垮了你的精神。等你終於到達前廳時，你已經在地上匍匐爬行了。就在這時，一個身著優雅西服的男子彎下腰，挽住了你的手臂，把你拉起了身。你正準備感謝他，卻突然意識到他是誰。和他一打照面，你就驚恐地連連後退。這個扮演陌生人一角的演員還戴著他蒼白而面無表情的面具。他一語不發地向你鞠了一躬，旋即走出了沃德劇院的正門。"

"When you awaken, you are sitting in the choeur gothique of Mont Saint-Michel’s abbey. No rain pelts the glass of the windows above, and you hear no thunder, nor the screeching of winged horrors overhead. Somehow, you have escaped. You creep to the door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block the glare of the sun. You stand overlooking beautiful Mont Saint-Michel. Seagulls fly over the abbey under a backdrop of cloudless sky. The waters around the abbey are calm and azure-blue.\n"
"“I’ve been looking all over for you!” You hear a voice exclaim behind you. You turn with a startle. For a moment you expect to see the Stranger and his Pallid Mask, but instead, the boat captain you’d hired to take you to Mont Saint-Michel stands at the edge of the steps, smiling at you. “Are you ready to head back?”"

"你醒來時，發現自己坐在聖米歇爾山修道院的哥特式唱詩臺上。沒有雨點打在頭頂的玻璃窗上，也聽不到雷鳴和空中飛行駭物的尖叫。你莫名其妙就躲過一劫。你爬向修道院的大門，顫顫巍巍推開了門。刺眼的的陽光燒灼著你的雙眼，你抬起手，遮蔽太陽的光照。你站起身俯瞰著美麗的聖米歇爾山。萬里晴空之下，海鷗在修道院上方飛翔。修道院周圍的海碧藍通透，水波不驚。\n"
"“我一直在到處找你！”你聽到身後有人在呼喚你。你驚訝地扭頭一看。恍惚之間，你還以為會看到陌生人和他的蒼白面具，但那只是你僱傭帶你來聖米歇爾山的船長，他站在臺階一邊，沖著你微笑：“你準備回去了嗎？”"

They are resigned to their hideous fate, but still you try day after day to bring them your message. You must warn them of The King in Yellow, of Hastur and of Carcosa. “Another lost soul,” they say, but they cannot possibly fathom what you have gone through in your attempt to save them. You warn them that he is coming to claim them, but they never believe you. You write of Aldebaran and of the black stars on the wall of your cell, but the words become faded as the years go by. Your warning is never heeded."
