"You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House and hide Daniel from the authorities, although you’re unsure how long you’ll be able to stay in Arkham with an escaped asylum patient. Daniel is a loose cannon, dazed and unresponsive one moment, and screaming for his life the next. It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”\n"
"Hours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts, mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that he has been choked to death."

"你打算在老馬旅社避避風頭，藏匿丹尼爾並且躲過當局追捕，儘管你也不知道你能帶著一名出逃的精神病人在阿卡姆待多久。丹尼爾是個不受控制的危險人物，他一會兒雙目茫然，毫無反應，一會兒又情緒激動，拼了命地大喊大叫。他過了好幾天才明白，自己不會再被送進精神病院了，但出於某些原因，這使他更加恐懼。“他會來找我的，他會來找我的！”他絮絮叨叨，有時一念叨就是好幾個小時。最後，在一個異常溫暖而漫天星光的夜裡，丹尼爾十分冷靜，向你打開話匣。“黃衣之王，不僅僅是一部戲劇，”他解釋道，“那是一個名叫'哈斯塔'的存在，而現在他要帶走我了。但你還有時間。你還沒被附身。你還沒有説出誓約。無論你要做什麼，千萬別說出他的名字。不要屈服。”你向他問到城裡發生的怪異事件。還有你遭遇的邪教徒和生物。“他們都想找到卡爾克薩，”他坦然說道。你認出這個名字正是戲劇中黃衣之王所統治的虛構城市。“他們想要將哈斯塔從他的囚禁之地釋放出來。但你！——你可以在他們之前開啟通往卡爾克薩的道路！你可以永遠地封印哈斯塔！”他咆哮著緊緊地抓住你，“快，趕在陌生人發現你的計劃之前！”\n"
"幾個小時之後，丹尼爾又變得語無倫次，反應遲純。你出門散了很久的步，想讓自己的大腦放輕鬆，將新吸收的信息細嚼慢嚥。你不知應該對他瘋狂的言論作何理解。你無法決定下一步該怎麼做，於是返回住所，卻發現自己房間的門遭到破壞，敞開著。丹尼爾躺在地上一動不動，面色蒼白。從他脖子上的淤青看來，你推測他是窒息致死的。"

msgid "You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House, unsure whether news of the events at the asylum will get out to the general public. You take this time to make extensive notes of the events you’ve experienced thus far, including the brief dialogue between you and Daniel. He’d spoke of The King in Yellow as if it were an actual being, and even named it. “Hastur.” He’d rambled and muttered and screeched other phrases, as well. You doubt you’ll ever forget them. “He made us speak the Oath.” “The price was paid.” “They are opening the path to Carcosa.” For hours, you think about Daniel’s warning to you, which he begged you to heed: “Do not speak His name.” His final moments play out in your mind over and over again."
msgstr "你打算先在老馬旅社避避風頭，畢竟你不知道瘋人院裡發生的事件是否已經傳揚開來。正好利用這段時間把你迄今所經歷的事件，還有與丹尼爾的短暫談話都記錄下來。他說起黃衣之王的時候彷彿那是真實的存在，甚至說出了他的名字。“哈斯塔。”他來回踱步，口中念念有詞，還尖聲喊著其他的短句。他所說的話或許你永遠都無法忘記。“他強迫我們發下了誓約。”“已經付出了代價。”“他們將要開啟通往卡爾克薩的路。”在幾個小時裡你都在思考丹尼爾的警告，他當時懇求你聽他一言：“別說出他的名字。”他臨終的畫面一遍又一遍地在你的腦海中重現。"

"On the third night, you return to your room to find the door broken open. You enter cautiously, wondering if the police are onto you. Or worse, the Stranger. You are surprised to find the body of Daniel Chesterfield instead, lying on the ground with a pained, wide-eyed expression on his face. He is dead. His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n"
"<center><fancy>[elder_sign]Carcosa is real</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>Do not let them open the path</fancy></center>\n"
"When Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:\n"
"<center><fancy>Hastur is the king in tatters</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>locked in his prison in the stars</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>seal him away and stop this madness!</fancy></center>\n"
"Your mind swims with questions. How did he escape the asylum? How did he die? And why does he appear human to your eyes now? With little time to spare, you clean the room of your belongings and flee. Daniel’s words, which he begged you to heed, play out in your mind over and over again."

"在第三天夜裡，你回到房間時發現房門遭到破壞，敞開著。你小心翼翼地進屋，想知道是不是警察找上門來了。或者情況更糟，找上門來的是陌生人。讓你吃驚的是，房間裡等待著你的是丹尼爾的屍體，他躺在地板上，臉上掛著痛苦的神情，雙目大睜。他死了。他的雙眼滿佈血絲，呈現黃色，僵硬的手中緊握著一本《黃衣之王》。你掰開他的手指，把他死死握住的手冊拿了出來，查看手冊的內容。丹尼爾在每頁的空白處潦草地寫下了一些文字，大部分都難以理解，一部分清晰地作了強調。在初次提到卡爾克薩這座虛構城市時，丹尼爾在旁邊滾草地寫著：\n"
"<center><fancy>[elder_sign]卡爾克薩是真的</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>不要讓他們開啟道路</fancy></center>\n"
"當卡西露達談到襤褸之王時，丹尼爾寫著：\n"
"<center><fancy>哈斯塔是身披襤褸的王</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>被囚禁在群星之間的牢獄中</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>將他封印起來並且阻止瘋狂延績下去！</fancy></center>\n"
"你滿腦子都是問號。他是怎麼逃出瘋人院的？他又是怎麼死去的？為什麼他以人形出現在你眼前？無暇多顧，你把自己的東西從房間裡清理乾淨，逃離此地。丹尼爾給你留下的字句，傳達了他懇切的忠告，一遍又一遍地在你的腦海中重現。"
