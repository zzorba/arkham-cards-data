msgstr "冒險I：謝幕"

msgid "You awaken with a start, as though shaken by an unseen force. You must have slept for quite some time, for there are only a few other patrons in the audience, and no performers on stage. The lights are dimmed, and the stage curtains are tattered and ripped, though you do not remember that being the case during the first act. You wait a moment before you are sure this isn’t part of the performance. As you wait, a foul but unrecognizable smell permeates the air. How long have you been asleep? Shaking off your drowsiness, you walk toward one of the seated patrons and ask for the time, but he does not respond. It is then that you realize you are speaking to a corpse."
msgstr "你被一股看不見的力量搖醒了。你肯定是睡了很長一段時間，此時觀眾席上只剩下幾個觀眾，舞台上也不見表演者的蹤影。舞台的幕布破破爛爛，燈光昏暗，但你記不起來在第一幕的時候是否也是這幅景象。你等了好一會才確定這並非演出的一部分。就在你等待的時候，一股難以名狀的惡臭在空氣中彌漫。你到底睡了多久？你擺脫了睏意，向坐在座位上的一個觀眾走去，問他現在是什麼時候，但他沒有回答你。此時你意識到你正在對一具屍體說話。"

"Once again you are startled awake, this time by the cold, clammy fingers of a hand on your shoulder. “Are you alright?” an elderly man asks, helping you to your feet. Your mind is a flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t staked a claim on, I tell you.”\n"
"You stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking. “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty— save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost."

"你再次從睡夢中驚醒，這次將你弄醒的是搭在你肩膀上的一隻手，它的手指冰冷，又黏又濕。“你還好嗎？”一位老人攙扶你起身，關切地問道。你腦海裡的記憶十分凌亂。你只記得在最後，沃德劇院已經變成了一個噩夢，裡面充斥著危險的狂熱信徒和怪異而可怖的東西。你憂心仲仲地環顧周圍，發現自己站在劇院外溼滑的路邊。儘管早前發生過那些事件，這座城在你眼中並無異常——至少說，這對阿卡姆城來說挺正常的。車燈的強光刺入你的雙眼，一輛車開了過來，將航髒的雨水濺到你身旁的人行道上。老人見你的眼中驚恐萬分，表情對你十分關切。“你是遭賊了嗎？那群惹是生非的壞小子真該死！”他大聲罵道：“他們準是在今晚到劇院來為非作歹了！我跟你說，這兒到處都是他們的地盤。”\n"
"你站了起來，走到沃德劇院前門的窗戶前，試著往裡看看，但因為裡面太黑，你什麼都看不見。老人好奇地看了你一會，聳了聳肩然後走開了。“好吧，我得走了。我要是你的話我也會早些離開的，”他說完就拐過了街角。你快步跟上，想要提醒他遠離劇院。但當你走過轉角時，那位老人已經不見蹤影，你只見陌生人戴著他那毫無特徵的蒼白面具，向你投來熟悉的視線。他定定地注視著你。“你是誰？”你大聲問道。陌生人沒有回答，而是轉身離去，消失在劇院後的小巷中。你緊追在後，期望從他口中得到答案，但當你到達小巷時，那裡空空如也——除了在劇院員工入口旁邊張貼的一張告示，“別掃興了！ 快來參加《黃衣之王》的慶功派對吧。晚上八點在大西洋街1452號，康斯坦絲·杜梅因的住宅舉行派對。請著正裝到場。”你從牆上撕下這張告示並且收了起來，心中既沮喪又茫然。"

"Fleeing from the theatre, you head straight to the police station in Easttown. Bursting through the door, to the stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk sergeant, who is lazily working through a stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist, but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice. “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your back as he escorts you out of the station.\n"
"You <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your coat pocket, hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek."

"你逃出劇院之後直奔東城區的警察局。你徑直推開警察局的大門，迎著所有旁觀者和警員的目光，你說有緊急的事情要見恩格爾警長。值班的警官正懶洋洋地做著手邊的文書工作，他搖搖頭，抬起一根手指指向旁邊的一張椅子，不發一語。你焦灼地等待著。等待的每一秒都如此地漫長。時鐘的指針艱難前行。你不耐煩地跺著腳，在桌面上敲敲手指。你不時地回頭看，確認戴著蒼白面具的陌生人沒從前門的窗戶上盯著你看。終於，值班警官放下手中的筆，起身並向你招手。“好吧，是什麼要緊事？”你向他說明這夜發生的種種事件，還沒說完他就嘆氣搖頭。“聽著，如果說你在說笑話，這一點都不好笑，”他說：“整晚都有警察在商業區駐守。別想在我面前說胡話。”你堅持想要說服他，但值班警官起身開門，示意讓你離開。他拔高了音量：“難不成你覺得我閒得發慌？快走！”他盯著你離開警局，嘴裡嘟囔著“蠢貨”。\n"
"你<b>知道</b>你今晚所見非虛。你沮喪地回到沃德劇院，希望能找到一些證據帶回警局。驚奇的是劇院的大門鎖上了。在你決定是否要破門而入的時候，劇院的員工入口旁張貼的一張告示吸引了你的注意力。“別掃興了！快來參加《黃衣之王》的慶功派對吧。晚上八點在大西洋街1452號，康斯坦絲‧杜梅因的住宅舉行派對。請著正裝到場。”你撕下告示，將它折好放進外套的口袋裡，祈禱它能帶領你找到答案。"

"You think about going to the police, but considering the horrors in the theatre, they’re more likely to think you’re mad than to believe your story. A small part of you wonders if this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget. Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior looks the same as it did when you arrived to see The King in Yellow earlier that night. You walk to the front window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\n"
"Just then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\n"
"His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, and instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre.

"你打算上警察局，但考慮到劇院裡發生的事情可怕如斯，那幫警察不會相信你所說的，而更可能會認為你是個瘋子。在你心底仍抱有些許懷疑，或許那不過是一場惡作劇，但這事兒不一樣——這整件事實在過於真實，過於可怕，使你全然無法忘卻。你不知所措，謹慎地按照逃出劇院的路線返回。街道上車流穿梭，車頭燈的明亮光線刺入你的雙眼，將骯髒的雨水濺到你身旁的人行道上。很快，沃德劇院映入你的眼簾，亮堂的燈盞照亮了商業區的街道。你本以為劇院已成廢墟，但它看起來跟你今晚早些時候觀看《黃衣之王》時別無二致。你走到沃德劇院前門的窗戶前，試著往裡看看，但因為裡面太黑，你什麼都看不見。就在這時，一陣寒意掠過你的後頸，你察覺你在被人監視。你一轉身，發現有個黑影從街角跑過。一群蟑螂從路上流竄，追隨那個黑影的蹤跡而去。你的肌肉莫名地繃緊，緊接著你便往街角追去。一個似曾相識的男子站在人行道上，他一副漠不關心的姿態，臉上還戴著一張毫無特徵的蒼白面具。\n"
