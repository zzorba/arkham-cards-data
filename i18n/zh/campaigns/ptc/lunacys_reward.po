msgid "The change in the atmosphere has you curious. What if it was all a trick of your mind? What if the hauntings that follow The King in Yellow are but transitory? The answers to all of your questions might lie inside. Cautiously, you open the front door to the manor once again. Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling upon the steering wheel."
msgstr "氛圍的轉變使你疑惑。這會不會只是你腦海中的錯覺？還是說《黃衣之王》緊跟著的鬼影轉瞬即逝？你所有問題的答案，可能就在這大宅裡面。你小心翼翼地再次打開莊園的前門。隨著你步入莊園，令人安心的爵士樂和人們閒聊的嘈雜聲愈發響亮。空氣中飄來煎烤豬肉的誘人香味。如你所料，你先前所發現的掙扎的跡象和種種怪事都已消失。然後，當你拐進宴會廳時，你發現陌生人正在和另一個男人交談，他身材高挑，蓄有鬍鬚，一身體面的黑西裝，手裡拿著銀色手柄的手杖。陌生人轉向你，他的目光穿透了你的心靈，你的視線痛苦地四處游移。在你意識到這一切之前，你便用盡全力跑了起來，痛覺和不知所蹤的方向感使你在門廊處栽倒在地。連喘息的時間都沒有，你衝到你的車子上並快速離開，扶在方向盤上的手都是顫抖的。"

msgid "You can’t trust your senses. This is all a trick, an attempt to lure you back inside. You’re no safer now than you were before. Swallowing your fear, you set to work barricading the front door of the manor using several of the heavy stone benches lining the cobblestone path in the front yard. You hope it’s enough, but you aren’t willing to stick around to find out. As soon as you’re done, you head back to your vehicle and drive toward Southside, where you hope to find answers."
msgstr "你無法相信你所感知到的。這就是個圈套，想要引你回到那幢大宅去。你此刻仍處於危險之中。強忍著心頭的恐懼，你開始從前庭的鵝卵石路上搬運幾個沉甸甸的石凳，將它們堵在莊園的前門上。希望這些足夠把門堵住，然而你不願留在這兒尋找真相。完成這項工作之後，你回到車上，駛向南區，期望你能在那兒找到答案。"

msgid "You dare not risk stepping back inside that madhouse. But you can’t let the monstrosities run amok, either. You root through the open garage for a few supplies, finding an old hose, an empty gasoline canister, and some matches. Knowing what you must do, you first siphon some gas from Mrs. Dumaine’s Oakland 6-54A. You spread the gasoline across the front porch, inside the garage, and around the manor’s outer walls. From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off toward Southside, full of grim determination."
msgstr "你不敢冒險回到那幢瘋人院般的大宅中去。但你也不能讓那群可怕的傢伙肆意殺戮。你在敞著的車庫裡東翻西找，找到了一些東西：一根舊水管，一個空的汽油罐，還有一些火柴。深知這事兒非做不可，你首先從杜梅因夫人的奧克蘭6-54A汽車中抽出一些汽油。你將汽油灑在門廊上、車庫內，還在整個莊園的外牆澆了一圈。之後只用幾根火柴便可引起一場火災。你從前廳看著整個莊園最終被大火吞噬。火焰的爆裂聲，木頭噼噼啪啪地斷裂，與人們垂死發出的恐懼尖叫交織在一起，充斥著整條街道。眼前的火勢已達到預期，於是你回到車上並向南區駛去，心中只有堅如磐石的決心。"
