"You turn over the folded program in your hand, reading it for what seems like the hundredth time. “Miskatonic Playhouse presents: The King in Yellow,” it reads. “A special one-night engagement at Arkham’s very own Ward Theatre. An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\n"
"To have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming...and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\n"
"Finding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\n"
"The lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting...drifting...to sleep."

"你翻開手中折起的節目單，再次閱讀彷彿你已讀過百遍的這張紙片。“米斯卡塔尼克劇院上演：《黃衣之王》，”紙上這麼寫著。“阿卡姆本地的沃德劇院將迎來這部戲劇的特別上演，為期一晚。這部令人無法抗拒的戲劇共有兩幕。本作品由奈傑爾·英格蘭姆負責籌劃和管理。本劇演員均屬於一個小型劇團，在演員名單最後還有個未署名的人物：“陌生人。”\n"
"這樣一部萬眾期待的戲劇不遠萬里從巴黎來到阿卡姆，即便只上演一夜它也備受矚目。在演出前的幾個星期裡，它一直是城中熱話。雖然跡象不甚明顯……然而，你有證據證明有某種邪惡勢力正在行動。最初是劇院有個舞台工作人員失蹤——一個才十七歲的男孩在一次彩排中缺席，之後就再也沒人見過他。到距離演出已不到兩個星期的時候，一位音樂家被發現死亡，並且屍體口中含著槍。或許最讓人生畏的是警察從獨立廣場抓到的瘋漢，他滿口胡言亂語，說著“王已歸來”之類的瘋話。他被帶到阿卡姆瘋人院之後你驚訝地發現，產生這種妄想的並不止他一人。\n"
"你和你的同伴們經過深入調查之後，發現這些事件十分可疑。儘管無法證實這些事件之間有何關聯，而這部即將上演的戲劇周圍所發生的離奇事件遠不止這些。一椿椿自殺事件和發瘋事件接踵而來，你決心要找出背後的真相。\n"
"觀眾席的燈光暗了下來，聚光燈投下的燈光落在舞台上。眼前的情景與你的預期相去甚遠。《黃衣之王》的第一幕緩慢而單調，使人感到無聊乏味。這部戲劇的背景和角色足夠吸引，但曲折而怪誕的劇情卻未能娛樂觀眾，也無法傳達什麼信息。你開始懷疑這些發生在《黃衣之王》周圍的駭人事件之間是不是根本就沒有聯繫。或許這不過是你的過度想像；這場平凡而不起眼的演出怎能引起這般混亂？令你吃驚的是第一幕沒有任何高潮和轉折就驟然結束了。幕間休息時燈光亮起，你忍住哈欠，想要提早離場。你正在躊躇之中，突然感覺自己睏意越來越濃……最終昏睡了過去。"

"Act I came and went without a hitch, as it often did in rehearsal. You couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions on many of the audience members’ faces, and you wonder how the audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\n"
"Just then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away— his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black."

"第一幕從演出到結束都未有差錯，如同平常彩排的一樣。你不由得注意到許多觀眾臉上空洞而輕蔑的神情，不知觀眾在觀看這部戲劇的下半部分時，會對令人煩厭的劇情作何反應。卡西露達這個角色在戲劇的前半部分實在令人厭倦，儘管她的王家氣度使你在扮演時樂在其中。你心中泛起對前搭檔米里亞姆·吐溫的懷念，突然間，你在巴黎時的恐懼和悲悼之情又湧上心頭。你聽見舞台工作人員開始為接下來的佈景做準備，你嘆了口氣，閃身躲到後台的漆黑角落，好避開人群。你試圖讓你的情緒平定下來，將你的思緒代入卡西露達——她的希望，她的恐懼，她的命運。\n"
"就在此時，你驚覺陌生人正從遠處盯著你看，僅短短一瞥就使你膽顫心驚。儘管他們在每場演出之前都會改換陌生人的扮演者(實際上在彩排時也發生過多次)，但你知道，在這緊要關頭換上的扮演者比過往的都要可怕得多。你意識到你從未得知他的名字，一陣恐懼的戰慄爬上你的後脊。你像是隻迷路的羔羊，懵然步向狼群……你無法將目光從他身上移開——他的雙眼緊盯著你。然後你眼前一黑。"
