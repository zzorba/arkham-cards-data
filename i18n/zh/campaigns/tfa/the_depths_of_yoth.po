"Several hours after you wake, your laborious descent pays dividends. The red glow emanating from the bottom of the steps grows brighter with each step. The stone floor finally levels off, and the choking tunnel walls open to reveal a labyrinthine network of immense, far-reaching caverns. Littered throughout the caverns are the ruins of a vast city, the likes of which you have never seen. The elaborate stone architecture has been worn away by ages of abandonment, but you sense that there is a history here that runs deeper than you can even fathom. When you turn around to question Ichtaca, you notice a faint yellow glow in her eyes, her pupils narrowed and contracted. “Yoth…the last refuge of Valusia…” she quietly intones.\n"
"Just then, a terrifying roar echoes throughout the cavern. The walls and floor shake with tremendous force, and the red glow that permeates the area brightens. A flood of hisses emerges from the tunnels all around you. Ichtaca walks to the edge of a nearby precipice and looks out over the vast depths. “He is here. I feel his presence. The Father of the Serpents…<b>Yig</b>.”"
msgstr ""
"在醒來之後過了幾個小時，你艱難的向下行進終於獲得了回報。你在階梯上每前進一步，從階梯底部發出的紅色光芒都變得更加明亮。終於你來到了一塊石質平層，狹窄的隧道兩旁的牆壁豁然開朗，進入了一片無比龐大的洞穴迷宮。整個洞穴裡遍佈著一座龐大城市的遺跡，你從未見過如此景象。這些精美的石質建築現已荒廢多年，但你能感覺到此地有著一段歷史，比你想象要更加深遠。在你四下環視，想要向伊塔卡提問時，你發現她雙眼裡閃爍著微弱的黃光，她的瞳孔收縮並且變得狹窄。“幽嘶……瓦盧西亞最後的庇護所……”她低聲緩慢地說。\n"
"話音剛落，一陣恐怖的吼聲迴蕩在整個洞穴中。牆壁和地面劇烈地搖晃，這片區域滲透的紅光變得愈發明亮。你周圍的各條隧道內如同洪水一般傳來陣陣嘶嘶的叫聲。伊塔卡邁向最近的一處懸崖，望向廣闊的深淵。“他在這兒。我感覺到了他的存在。萬蛇之父……<b>‘伊格’</b>。”"

msgid "You realize now that Ichtaca has her own agenda. Alejandro, as well—both have been using you for their own ends, keeping you from the truth. You raise a weapon and demand answers from her, catching her by surprise. “Yig demands the relic be brought to the Nexus,” she responds anxiously. Her eyes glow brightly, and her skin starts to scale over. Your eyes narrow, and you move to corner her against the edge of the precipice, so she cannot escape. “The relic cannot be trusted to the hands of Brotherhood: this much is true…For it is Valusia that shall be restored to glory. Yig has called, and I must answer.” Before you can react, she throws herself off the edge and into the depths below."
msgstr "你如今發覺伊塔卡暗懷鬼胎。亞歷山卓亦然，他們二人為了自己的目的而利用你，對你隱瞞著實情。你出其不意地抓住她，舉起武器並逼問她的真實目的。“伊格命令把那件遺物帶到聯結點。”她緊張地回答道。她雙眼中的光芒愈發明亮，而她的皮膚開始被鱗片所覆蓋。你的雙眼瞇了起來，將她逼到懸崖邊上，確保她無法逃脫。“那件遺物不能落到兄弟會手裡：這是千真萬確的……必須用它來恢復瓦盧西亞的榮光。伊格發來呼喚，而我必須應答。”你還沒來得及反應，她縱身一躍，跳下深淵。"

"You approach Ichtaca and rest a hand on her shoulder. Your companion takes a deep breath and turns to face you. Her eyes are cast downward in shame, and they have returned to their normal color. “I…I’m sorry. I have brought you to your ruin. He called out to me, long ago, told me of my heritage, of my people. I did his bidding willingly.”\n"
"She clenches her fists, her gaze meeting yours. “But now I realize I was wrong. Humanity deserves its time on Earth. You may have inherited it from far more powerful forces, but it is humanity’s time, not theirs.” You don’t completely understand what she is saying, but you understand the implication. Whatever Ichtaca truly is, she is on your side. A calm silence lingers between you, an unspoken bond that joins you as one. “We must get to the Nexus and prevent the serpents from recovering the relic,” she explains after a few moments, breaking the silence. You nod in agreement."
msgstr "你走到伊塔卡邊上，將你一手放在她肩上。你的夥伴伊塔卡深吸一口氣，轉身面向你。她羞愧地低頭看向地面，而她雙眼的瞳色已經恢復正常。“我……對於把你帶進遺跡的事情，我很抱歉。在很久以前，他開口呼喚了我，將我要傳承的遺產，還有我同胞的事情盡數說給我聽。我順從地履行了他的命令。”她攥緊了拳頭，堅定的目光看向你，“但現在我發覺自己做錯了。地球現在的時代理應是屬於人類的。你們可能從遠比人類強大的勢力手裡繼承了地球，但現在已經是人類的時代，而不是它們的。”你並不能完全聽懂她在說什麼，但你理解了潛在的意義。不管伊塔卡的真實身份是什麼，至少她是站在你這邊的。你度過了一陣平靜的沉默，一種不可言說的聯繫使你二人仿佛一體同心。“我們必須前往聯結點，阻止蛇族取回遺物。”過了一會兒，她的話語打破了沉默。你點頭表示同意。"

msgid "You hesitate, unsure what to do next. What are Ichtaca’s true motives? Why has she led you here? Before you have the chance to react, she draws her bow and aims an arrow at your heart. “Thank you for aiding me this far,” Ichtaca says curtly, “but the time has come for us to part ways. Yig has called, and I must answer.” Her yellow eyes narrow and shine brightly."
msgstr "你遲疑了，不確定接下來要做什麼。伊塔卡真實的動機是什麼？她為什麼帶你來到這個地方？你還沒來得及反應，她便拉弓引箭，箭尖直指你的心臟。“感謝你一路以來的協助。”伊塔卡簡短地說道，“但我們是時候分別了。伊格發來呼唤，而我必須應答。”她黃色的雙眼瞇了起來，愈發明亮地閃爍。"

msgid "Remove Ichtaca from all investigator’s deck for the remainder of the campaign."
msgstr "將伊塔卡移出調查員的牌組，直到這個劇本結束。"

msgid "“You must leave this place at once. This is not humanity’s battle. It is ours. We cannot let you or the Brotherhood foil our plans. Not now, not when we are so close.” Her hand wavers for a moment, and her eyes flicker again. You can tell that something is tearing at her, weighing on her mind. Finally, she speaks again. “Go now. Before I change my mind. And if you wish to live, do not follow. I will not give you a second chance.” Ichtaca swiftly departs, eyes trained on you until she leaves your sight. Despite her warning, you feel that you have no choice but to follow. If you don’t, who will protect humanity?"
msgstr "“你必須立即離開這個地方。這不是一場人類的戰爭。而是‘我族’的。現在計劃將要完成，我們不能讓你或兄弟會阻撓我們的計劃。”她的手搖晃了片刻，雙眼再次開始閃爍。你看得出有什麼東西正在撕扯著她，壓迫著她的意識。最後，她再次開口：“在我改變主意之前，馬上離開。要是你還想活命，就別跟著我。我不會再給你第二次機會。”伊塔卡很快離開，她雙眼緊盯著你，直到她走出你的視線範圍。你感覺自己別無選擇，只能跟著她無視她的警告。如果你不這麼做，誰又來拯救人類呢？"

msgid "Now drop your weapons.” The betrayal stings your chest, and you are gripped with anger and despair. Thoughts of escape flash across your mind, but you have seen her skill with a bow—with her steady aim, you would be dead before you took two steps. You have no choice but to comply. Your weapons clatter to the ground, one at a time. “Good. Now the relic: hand it to me.” Grimacing, you take a few steps forward and offer the relic to Ichtaca."
msgstr "“放下武器。”伊塔卡的背叛使你胸口一陣刺痛，你心中滿是慎怒和失望。你腦海中閃過逃跑的想法，但你見識過她的高超箭術，在她的精準箭法之下，你沒跑幾步就會被弓箭射死。你別無選擇，只好服從。你身上的武器一個個地落到地面上。“很好。現在把遺物交給我。”你痛苦地向前走了幾步，將遺物交給了伊塔卡。"

msgid "Check your supplies to see if any investigator has a pocketknife."
msgstr "查看你們的補給品，檢查是否有調查員帶有折疊小刀。"

msgid "Pocketknife"
msgstr "摺疊小刀"

msgid "As Ichtaca reaches out to grab the relic, you pull out your concealed pocketknife and quickly attack, catching her by surprise. The blade cuts deeply across her forearm. Blood sprays across your chest, and she staggers with pain, gripping her arm. Her heel clips a rock near the edge of the precipice, and she tumbles over the side of the ledge, her scream growing distant as she falls. You barely have time to recover from the shock of what just happened, as another colossal roar fills the cavern, and the ground shakes. You gather your belongings and continue your descent."
msgstr "就在伊塔卡伸手要拿遺物的時候，你拔出了自己藏著的折疊小刀，出其不意地刺向她。刀刃深深地刺穿了她的小臂。血液飛濺到你的胸膛上，她忍受著疼痛，按著自己的手臂，趔趄著走了幾步。她的腳踝絆到了懸崖邊的一塊石頭，隨即她便從懸崖邊緣摔了下去，她的尖叫聲與她下落的身軀一同離你遠去。剛才發生的事情令你震驚，但你沒時間平復自己的心情，因為又一聲震耳欲聾的咆哮響徹整座洞窟，地面隨之劇震。你收起自己的行李，繼續向下深入。"

msgid "Ichtaca grabs the relic. You can see the skin on the back of her hand growing hard and scaly. You take a few steps back, knuckles white with anger. “Go now.
