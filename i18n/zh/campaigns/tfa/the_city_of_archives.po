"You remember very little of the next few days. Your consciousness fades in and out as your body grips with exhaustion, and your mind feebly attempts to comprehend what exactly has happened to you.\n"
"The inhabitants of this place are the same creatures you saw Alejandro consorting with: immense corrugated cones of clammy flesh, with four thick limbs extending from the top. They are horrifying to look upon, but they do not harm you as you expected they might. Your first few days are spent restrained and questioned by the creatures, several of which are somehow able to communicate in English. Others reproduce your language using an odd futuristic machine, played like a musical instrument. You are reminded strangely of the jazz piano at the Nightingale. It is only then that you realize your body has been altered. You have no hands or fingers to play the keys, no legs to walk upon, no lungs to scream out. You are one of them now, one of the creatures that has taken you captive, and your original body is nowhere to be seen.\n"
"Despite your captivity, the creatures do not seem intent on harming you. Instead, they merely interview you, asking all manner of questions about a broad range of topics: your society, your profession, your technology, your ecosystem, your human body. Their thirst for knowledge is unyielding, unending. Their questions range from the mundane to the complex. They implore you to write copiously in your own language, taking anything you write to store away in their vast archives. You are informed that you will be able to roam the city freely if you comply."

"在接下來的幾天裡，你都想不起多少事情。你的身體耗盡了氣力，意識時有時無，你的頭腦徒勞地運轉，試圖想明白到底發生了什麼。\n"
"此地的住民與你看見的同亞歷山卓在一起的生物別無二致：濕黏的肉體呈龐大錐形，佈滿了皺紋，從錐形頂部延伸出四根粗壯的附肢。它們看起來十分恐怖，但與你想像的相反，它們沒有傷害你。一開始的幾天裡，你受到這些生物的監禁和質問，它們之中甚至有人能夠用英語交流。而其他生物則用一個怪異的未來機器複製你的語言，它們使用那台機器的模樣就像彈奏樂器一般。你莫名地想起了“夜鶯”的爵士鋼琴。在這時你才意識到自己的身體已經改變了。你沒了能輕撫琴鍵的雙手和十指，沒了用以邁步前進的雙腿，沒了肺部的你甚至無法尖叫出聲。你現在成了“它們”之中的一員，變成了俘膚你的生物，而你原來的身體已經無處可尋。\n"
"雖然你遭到監禁，但這些生物似乎無意傷害你。相反的是，它們僅僅是與你談話，向你詢問了各種問題，話題涉及的範園甚廣：你的社會、專業、科技、生態，還有你的人類身體。它們對知識的渴求不屈不境，無休無盡，它們所提的問題由簡入繁，還請求你用自己的語言寫下大量文字，將你寫下的所有文字存入它們龐大的檔案館中。它們告訴你，要是你服從指令，就能在這座城中自由走動。"

msgstr "<i>協助這群生物，並將你所知道的一切都告訴它們。</i>"

msgid "<i>Refuse and resist captivity.</i>"
msgstr "<i>拒絕它們的要求，抗拒監禁。</i>"

msgid "You cooperate with the creatures, hoping to earn your freedom. You are sick of captivity, and perhaps you will be able to find a way home if you are able to roam the city at will. The creatures seem pleased that you are answering their questions, though their mannerisms are still completely alien to you. Days turn to weeks, perhaps even longer. It is difficult to tell. Finally, one of the creatures informs you that you are free to roam the halls of the city, with several restrictions: You are not allowed to do harm to your new body, for it belongs to another of their race, and you are not allowed to leave the city. Your restraints are lifted, and the creature watches with keen interest as you get used to your conical body."
msgstr "你協助這群生物，只盼能換來自由。你受夠了被監禁的日子，要是你能在這座城市中自由走動，或許你能夠找到回去的路。你對這群生物所提的問題一一作答，令它們十分滿意，儘管你還是完全無法理解它們的怪異行為。時間過去了幾個禮拜，或者更久。很難確定過去了多久。終於，其中一頭生物告訴你，你能夠自由地到城市的各個房間走走，但需要遵守幾項限制：你不能傷害自己的新身體，因為這具身體仍屬於它們的一名同胞，且你不能離開這座城。你的束縛被解開，看守著你的生物。有興趣地看著你適應自己的錐形身體。"

msgid "the investigators cooperated with the Yithians."
msgstr "調查員協助伊斯人。"

msgid "These creatures abducted you and even stole you from your own body. You refuse to give your captors even a single answer. You’d spit in their faces if you could—if you knew how to spit with such body, and if you knew which one of the creatures’ four distensible appendages was a face. Breaking free of your restraints is a hopeless endeavor, but you struggle to escape regardless. Your efforts do not go unnoticed, and one of the creatures is assigned to watch you. It seems more concerned with preventing you from harming your body than preventing you from escaping. After many days of captivity, you find a way to use this to your advantage. You struggle so hard against your restraints that they pierce into your leathery, cold flesh, drawing out a bit of viscous slime-blood. Your guard quickly apporoaches, clicking its claws together repeatedly. It undoes your restraints, and the moment it does, your claw appendages strike at what you believe to be the creature’s throat. It collapses to the floor, writhing in pain."
msgstr "這些生物綁架了你，甚至還將你從自己的身體裡偷走。你拒絕回答這群綁匪提出的哪怕一個問題。要是你能衝它們臉上啐上一口，你早就這麼幹了——前提是你得知道怎麼用這副身體來吐口水，你還得知道這種生物那四根脹大的附肢之中哪一根是它們的臉。衝破自己的束縛只是徒勞而已，但你不論如何都努力嘗試掙脫。你的動作被這群生物察覺，它們派出一頭生物來看守你。比起阻止你逃離此地，它似乎更注重阻止你傷害自己的身體。在多天的監禁過後，你找到一個辦法來利用這一點。你拼命地掙扎著想要掙脫束縛，把你那帶有硬皮的冰冷身軀弄傷，流出了粘液似的血液。看守你的生物飛快地趕來，不停地敲擊著自己的鉗子。它解開你的束縛，此時你揮動附肢，將鉗子襲向你認為是它喉嚨的部位。它摔倒在地，痛苦掙扎。"

"“Alejandro, what are you—?” You suddenly cry out. A nurse stands over you, peering into your eyes with a small light. You push the nurse away and rise to your feet, suddenly puzzled and disoriented. Despite the nurse’s protests, you wobble feebly out of the room. You are in a hospital, its white halls smelling faintly of disinfectant and other chemicals. Just moments prior, hadn’t you been exploring some kind of underground cavern?… You cannot recall.\n"
"“Excuse me? Come back, you must rest!” The nurse calls out to you, gripping your forearm and pulling you back to your cot. She examines you closely while you recover from the shock of being transported so far in so short a time. “Who is Alejandro?” she asks, and you struggle to recall. The name doesn’t ring a bell.\n"
"You ask the nurse how you came to be here, wondering why she isn’t surprised at your sudden appearance. “Why, you admitted yourself to St. Mary’s just last night. Do you not remember?” You have no memory of this, and you are starting to grow concerned. “You were acting a little strangely, if I may be so bold. And you spoke in a strange fashion, almost as if English weren’t your first language. But now I see that you probably just drank a little bit too much.” She notices your questioning expression and smiles. “Don’t worry. We get that kind of thing quite often these days, now that all the bars and pubs are on the up-and-up again.”\n"
"You examine your face in the mirror. You are tired and older than you remember. Something important lies on the very edge of your memory, fuzzy and blurred. It takes about a minute before the significance of the nurse’s last statement catches up to you. Turning back toward the nurse, you ask what year it is, terrified of the answer.\n"
"“Why, 1934 of course. My, you must have had a heck of a night!” She chuckles."

"“亞歴山卓，你到底——？”你突然尖叫出聲。一名護士站在你面前，伴著一束微弱的光芒仔細觀察你的眼睛。你推開了那名護士，站了起來，突然感到一陣困惑，不辨方向。不顧護士的勸阻，你拖著無力的身軀搖搖晃晃地走出了房間。你現在所在的地方是個醫院，白色的房間裡散發著隱隱約約的消毒水和其他藥品的氣味。就在這之前，你難道不是在探索某個地下洞穴嗎？……你想不起來了。\n"
"“你還好嗎？請回來，你必須休息！”護士在對你說話，她拉住了你的小臂，將你拉回床邊。你在如此短的時間內穿越了這麼遠的距離，當你驚魂稍定，她湊近對你作檢查。“誰是亞歷山卓？”她問道。於是你努力地去回想，但你對這個名字沒有印象。\n"
"你詢問護士，你是怎麼到這裡來的，而她為什麼對你的突然出現毫不意外。“為什麼這麼問，你自己來到聖瑪麗醫院申請入院的，就在昨天晚上。你忘了嗎？”你對此全無記憶，心生憂慮。“恕我無禮，當時你的行為有些奇怪。你說話的方式也很古怪，就像英語不是你的母語一樣。但現在我明白了，你大概只是酒喝多了。”她注意到你滿臉疑惑，對你微微一笑，“別擔心，最近我們常常遇到這樣的情况，畢竟現在所有的酒吧和俱樂部生意又紅火起來了。”\n"
"你在鏡中檢視自己的臉。你比自己記憶中要更疲倦、更年老。在你記憶與遺忘的交界處，有些重要的事情記不真切。過了大概一分鐘，你才領悟護士最後一句話的含義。你轉身面對護士，問她現在是哪一年，而答案使你萬分驚恐。\n"
"“怎麼這麼問，今年當然是1934年。親愛的，你準是昨晚玩瘋了！”她咯咯輕笑。"
