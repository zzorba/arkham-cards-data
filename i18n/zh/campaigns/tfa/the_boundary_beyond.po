msgstr "冒險IV：界限彼端"

msgid "Rays of hot yellow sunlight beat down on you from above as your car speeds down the dusty highways of southern Texas, just outside of San Antonio. It has been several days since you hit the road from Arkham on your way to Mexico City, where you may be able to get answers from some of Alejandro’s associates—or even better, from his adversaries in academia. Your recent investigations in Arkham uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail went cold soon after. The “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but vanished from the city. Its members left behind little information as to their next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever, the Eztli warrior sits in the passenger seat next to you. She is tense and coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her little comfort."
msgstr "當你驅車奔馳在德克薩斯州南部，聖安東尼奧城外塵土飛揚的公路上時，炎熱的陽光照射下來。距離你從阿卡姆城前往墨西哥城已經過了好幾天，在那兒你或許能詢問亞歷山卓的幾位同事——要是運氣更好的話，甚至還能問問他在學術界的對頭。你最近在阿卡姆開展的調查頗有斬獲，但即便你發揮畢生才學，追查到的線索還是轉瞬即逝。你在阿卡姆城揭露的“兄弟會”幾乎已從這座城市銷聲匿跡。除了“恩凱聯結點”這個名字以外，那個組織的成員幾乎沒留下甚麼線索，你對他們的下一個目標一無所知。伊塔卡確信，那個匯聚著能量的地方正是兄弟會的最終目的地。這名埃茲特里戰士一如以往的神祕莫測，坐在你旁邊的乘客座位上。她身體緊繃，像彈簧一樣蜷曲著，福特汽車的真皮座椅並沒能使她放鬆半分。"

msgid "“How close are we?” Ichtaca asks for the hundredth time since departing from Arkham. “We have to get to Anahuac as fast as we can. The longer we take, the more time the Brotherhood has to reach the Nexus.” You recognize the old Aztec name for the Valley of Mexico, and inform Ichtaca that you will be crossing the border into Mexico within the hour. She crosses her arms and grits her teeth."
msgstr "“還有多遠才到？”自從離開阿卡姆城開始，這已經是伊塔卡問的第一百遍了。“我們必須盡快趕到‘阿那瓦克’去。我們花的時間越長，兄弟會就有越多的時間能夠到達聯結點。”你聽出了這是墨西哥一個山谷的名字，得名於古老的阿茲特克，你告訴伊塔卡，你們會在一個小時內穿過邊境，進入墨西哥。她雙臂交叉，咬緊牙關。"

"Throughout your journey, Alejandro scribbles endlessly in his journal, the sound of pencil scratching against paper a constant reminder of his presence. He remains huddled in the back seat of the car, his knees keeping the journal still, his brows furrowed in thought. “This ‘Brotherhood’ is the least of our concerns,” he says with an air of finality. “I’ve been trying to decrypt the glyphs the device bears. The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\n"
"Ichtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\n"
"Crossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."
msgstr ""
"在你的整趟旅程中，亞歷山卓沒完沒了地寫著他的日誌，鉛筆沙沙地摩擦紙張，這聲響不斷提醒著你他的存在。他縮在汽車後座上，膝蓋還支著日誌，正皺著眉頭沉思。“我們不用管什麼‘兄弟會’。”他篤定地說道，“我曾經嘗試破解遺物上的雕文。那些符號明顯不屬於阿茲特克人，也不屬於馬雅人，甚至不來自其他任何的中美洲文明。我認為這件遺物來自別的什麼地方。它是被從那兒帶到這兒來的。你難道不這麼認為嗎，伊塔卡小姐？”\n"
"伊塔卡本就冷酷的表情一暗，眼睛瞇了起來。對亞歷山卓開口之前，她甚至都沒從座位上轉過身來。“在它誕生的地方，愛管閒事的學者不能濫用它的力量。”她冷冰冰地回答，結束了這次交談。\n"
"有賴於亞歷山卓的人脈，你穿過邊境前往墨西哥的時候沒你想像中的那麼費勁。你輕鬆地通過了海關，他們甚至都沒有瞥你一眼，片刻後你們已經在前往墨西哥城的路上了。"

msgstr "你在邊境以北把車停了下來，好在這過夜。你的目光被空蕩蕩的後座所吸引，你想知道亞歷山卓現在到哪去了。"

msgid "Fuel is a constant concern throughout your journey south. You are able to refuel several times along the way at general and hardware stores, but eventually your car putters out along the side of the road, just north of the southern border. You and Ichtaca are forced to walk several miles to the nearest town to refuel, setting you back several hours."
msgstr "在你的南部之旅中，需要時刻注意燃料。在路上的便利店或五金店，你可以補充幾次燃料，但是突然間，就在南部邊境以北的地方，你的車子在馬路邊上熄了火。你和伊塔卡不得不走了幾英里到最近的城市去補充燃料，耽誤了好幾個小時。"

"After arriving in Mexico City, you are disheartened to find very little information regarding the Brotherhood or the Nexus. You peruse the archives of the city’s libraries and universities, but come up empty- handed. You can’t find any of Alejandro’s former colleagues in the city, and even his enemies refuse to speak to you, save for one: a woman named Padma Amrita, who studied Alejandro’s work before he came to Arkham. She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\n"
"Padma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs.\n"
"Once she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation…"

"抵達墨西哥城之後，你幾乎找不到關於兄弟會或“聯結點”的信息，令你沮喪不已。你仔細翻閱城內各所圖書館和大學保存的檔案，但卻一無所獲。你在這座城市裡一個亞歷山卓的前同事都找不到，連他的論敵都不願與你交談，只有一個人例外：一位名叫帕德瑪·阿姆麗塔的女士，她在亞歷山卓來到阿卡姆之前就研究過他的學說。她願意在今晚的晚些時候與你見上一面，約在城南的一間時髦的酒吧。伊塔卡站在你不遠處，靜靜地留意著你新找到的情報提供者。\n"
"帕德瑪對於亞歷山卓的研究知之甚詳，還聲稱自己聽說過“恩凱聯結點”，但她不願告訴你如何才能找到那個地方。“傻子才要幹這事呢。”她對你說道，“那個地方是找不到的，不過是虛構的神話。相信我，很多人都找過它，但沒人找得到。”你指出埃茲特里人並非虛構，而她對你報以一個迷人的微笑，“或許那不是假的，但所謂的埃茲特里人還‘活著’？這幾百年間都沒被人發現？”她縱情大笑“滿嘴胡話，你真是天真又單純。得了吧，難不成你還以為會有‘正牌’學者相信這話？”你的目光轉向伊塔卡，她雙臂交叉著偷聽你談話，指甲深深嵌進了自己的小臂。帕德瑪的目光也一同轉來，嘴角上揚，流露出得意的神色。“不管怎樣，我得跟你說聲對不起，我沒有任何對你有用的信息。只有傻子才會繼續這項‘研究’，祝你好運。”帕德瑪換上另一種迷人的微笑轉身離去，身後留下了一陣甜香。\n"
"她走出視線後，伊塔卡馬上在你旁邊坐下，與你討論下一步行動。過去的一週裡，她嘗盡了失敗的滋味，耐心逐漸消退。你提出接下來問話的幾個人選，但她心不在焉。當你回到旅館時，她馬上回到自己的房間為明天作準備。你決定今晚就此睡下，而過了不久，你的思緒開始飄忽，迷迷糊糊地陷入熟睡。在你意識深處，不知怎的，你聽到伊塔卡在唸誦一種神祕的咒語……"

"When you next open your eyes, you are back in the bed of your hotel room. You raise your hand to shield your eyes from the sunlight that pierces through the bedroom’s curtains. The glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples. Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air.\n"
"Rising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\n"
"Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back. I know where to find the Nexus, and you must journey with me.”"

"你需要十分艱難的努力才能站起身。你腦海深處響起一道細微的聲音，告訴你這一切都是你自己的想像，只是過於疲倦而引起的一場噩夢。那是自我保護的聲音，警告你不要繼續走上瘋狂之路。你不理會這聲音，試著站起身，雙腳在恐懼和疲乏的驅使下哆哆嗦嗦。周圍寂靜無聲，你呼喚伊塔卡，想問問她是否還記得昨晚發生的事情——或者她當時在不在那裡。你發現她癱倒在地，背靠著旅館房間的門。她失去了知覺，毫無反應，臉色蒼白。你滿懷擔憂，試了好幾分鐘來弄醒她，終於成功了。她嗆了一口唾沫並恢復知覺，劇烈地咳嗽，渾身抽蓄，就像著了魔一般。“那個洞穴——天空中的那張血色巨口，你看見它了嗎？”\n"
"你試圖回想昨晚發生的事情，腦袋便陣陣作痛，只得搖頭。“那準是通往聯結點的路，”她繼續用一隻手緊緊地扶著自己的腦袋說道。你想要扶她站起來，但被她推開。“我剛剛在‘想’什麼？界線越來越薄弱，再受壓迫的話就會破裂。”她的目光轉向你，“我不該把你捲進來的，但不論喜歡與否，你都被捲進來了。現在要回頭已經太晚了。我知道在哪能找到聯結點，你必須和我一起走。”"

The maw in the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\n"
"It is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing…Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains unspoken: In the haze of broken timelines and unexplainable phenomena, the path you saw was “one future.” A future you intend to fulfill."

"你很難記起在那邊具體發生了什麼，但紅色洞穴的景象仍留存在你記憶中。你告訴伊塔卡，你也看見了那個洞穴，並且問她怎麼知道那個地方是通向聯結點的。她通紅的雙眼與你目光相接，你發現她嘴角帶有一絲笑意。“這事很難做到……要凝視界限的另一頭，甚至是看到時間線。或許你比你看起來的要更強大。”她語帶諷刺，令你不解。她沒有回答你的問題便離開了，但你已經知道了她沒說出口的那個答案：支離破碎的時間線和無法解釋的現象如同一團迷霧，而你從中看見的道路是“一個未來”。一個你將實現的未來。"
