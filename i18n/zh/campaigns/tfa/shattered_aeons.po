msgid "Scenario VIII: Shattered Aeons"
msgstr "冒險VIII：破碎永世"

msgid "The silver-blue flames that have guided you through these passages are the only vestige of hope you have remaining. One by one, the braziers lead you onward. Someone or something placed these devices here. The technology is not unlike what you have seen in the caverns of K’n-yan, or in the Eztli ruins where the relic was first found. However, it seems whoever ventured this deep below the crust of the Earth must have turned and fled, for the final brazier has been toppled and broken, and you see no more of them ahead. Thankfully, you do not need to travel in the darkness for very long. Within minutes, you come upon a huge stone doorway: no doubt the entrance to the Nexus."
msgstr "指引著你走過無數通道的銀藍色火焰，儼然已是你唯一抱有的希望。一個個火盆指引你前行。某些生物將這些設備設置在此處。這些設備的技術與你在昆揚洞穴裡所見的一致，也與你初次找到遺物時所在的埃茲特里遺跡相同。但是，不管冒險深入地球內部的是誰，他肯定轉身逃走了，因為最後一個火盆被推倒並且破壞，而你前方已看不見更多的火盆。慶幸的是，你不用在黑暗中久留了。幾分鐘之後，你面前出現一道巨大的石門：毫無疑問，這就是聯結點的入口。"

msgid "Since you possess no light to guide you, you have spent every waking moment with part of your body pressed against the cavern wall, using the cold stone to navigate without losing course. As you travel, your fingers find warm, smooth grooves along the wall: the same dormant technology that existed in the Eztli ruins. You are clearly not the first to enter this abyssal place. However, whoever came here before you must have fled before their work was done, since the channels did not light to guide your way or glare with anger as you approached. Hours pass as you make your way gradually in the dark, until finally you come upon a huge stone doorway: no doubt the entrance to the Nexus."
msgstr "面前再無光亮指引你，在意識清醒的每一秒裡，你盡力把自己的身體靠在雕刻的石壁上，利用這冰冷的石壁來指引方向，避免迷失。在你前行的過程中，你的手指觸碰到牆體上一道溫熱、光滑的凹槽：與長眠於埃茲特里遺跡的技術同出一轍。你顯然並非第一個闖入這個地方的人。但是，不管在你之前來到此地的人是誰，他肯定沒完成任務便逃走了，因為這通道既沒有光亮來指引你的方向，有沒有在你到達時怒發眩光。幾個小時之後，你在黑暗中逐步前行，直到你面前出現一道巨大的石門：毫無疑問，這就是聯結點的入口。"

msgid "Each investigator begins this scenario with 2 fewer cards in their opening hand."
msgstr "在本場冒險開始時，每位調查員起始手牌張數減少2。"

msgid "Your hand traces over the lines carved in the doorway. An inscription. A warning to turn back, for to open this passage is to invite doom. It is too dark to recognize the language, but you know it is not one spoken by humanity in this day and age. You have no idea how you can understand the engraving. Perhaps some last remnant of memory from your time in Pnakotus, lost city of the Yithians. Or perhaps you are truly mad, discerning meaning from natural indentations in the stone wall. After all, it has been almost a week since you have seen natural light."
msgstr "你單手循著石門上雕刻的線條探索。門上有一道銘文。銘文寫的是警告，讓你離開，開啟這條通路將會迎來毀滅。四周的黑暗使你難以辨認銘文的語言，但你知道那不同於當代人類所說的任何一種語言。你不知道你是怎麼讀懂這銘文的。或許是你在伊斯人失落的城市——納克特的經歷所留下的記憶。或許你是個徹頭徹尾的瘋子，僅憑石壁上帶有的凹痕便能讀懂含意。畢竟，你已經有將近一個禮拜沒有見過自然界的光亮。"

msgid "The stone doorway is sealed shut when you arrive, but as soon as you approach, the artifact begins to shake and hum loudly. Grooves along the door flicker alight with a shimmering glow, and suddenly the door shifts open of its own accord. You grip the artifact tightly and enter."
msgstr "當你到達時，這扇被封印的石門緊閉著，但就在你觸碰的瞬間，遺物開始震動並發出響亮的嗡嗡聲。石門上的凹痕開始閃爍著微光，石門突然自動開啟。你緊緊握著遺物，邁進石門。"

msgid "The stone doorway is already open when you arrive. Grooves along the door are lit with a shimmering glow. The Brotherhood must already be here. You have arrived with only moments to spare."
msgstr "在你到達時，石門早已敞開。石門上的凹痕以微弱的光芒亮了起來。兄弟會定是早就來到了這裡，這時你已無暇多作準備。"

msgid "Because there are more [tablet] tokens in the chaos bag than [cultist] tokens:"
msgstr "因為混亂袋中的[tablet]標記比[cultist]標記多："

msgid "Because there are more [cultist] tokens in the chaos bag than [tablet] tokens:"
msgstr "因為混亂袋中的[cultist]標記比[tablet]標記多："

msgid "Because there are an equal number of [cultist] and [tablet] tokens in the chaos bag:"
msgstr "因為混亂袋中的[cultist]標記和[tablet]標記數量相等："

msgid "Put the Nexus of N’kai into play. Each investigator begins play in the Nexus of N’kai."
msgstr "將恩凱聯結點放置入場。每位調查員從恩凱聯結點開始遊戲。"

msgid "Set the following 2 enemy cards out of play: Ichtaca (Scion of Yig) and Alejandro Vela (Or, Is He?)."
msgstr "將以下2張敵人卡放在一邊，位於場外：伊塔卡<i>(伊格的後裔)</i>和亞歷山卓·維拉<i>(或許不是他？)</i>。"

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Formless Spawn, Relic of Ages (Unleash the Timestream), A Pocket in Time, Act 4a—“Paradise Lost”, Act 4a—“Timelock”, and the 6 single- sided [[Shattered]] locations."
msgstr "將下列卡牌放在一邊，位於場外：無形之子、古代遺物<i>(時光湧流)</i>、時間之窗、場景4a—“失樂園”、場景4a—“鎖定時間”、6張單面[[破碎]]地點。"

msgid "Create the exploration deck. This is done by taking the 3 remaining single-sided locations and shuffling them together, along with 1 copy each of the following encounter cards: Wracked by Time, Between Worlds, and Ancient Evils."
msgstr "構建探索牌堆。拿取3張剩餘的單面地點，將這些地點與遭遇卡一同混洗形成探索牌堆，所混洗的遭遇卡為以下每種1張：時空撕裂、異界之間、遠古惡魔。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. For every 10 tally marks under “Yig’s Fury,” place the top card of the lead investigator’s deck in the victory display, facedown. For the remainder of the scenario, treat each of those cards as if it has Vengeance 1."
msgstr "查看冒險日誌。“伊格之怒”下方每有10次紀錄，將調查員隊長牌堆頂的1張卡牌正面朝下放入勝利牌區。在本場冒險接下來的時間裡，將這些卡牌每張視為帶有<b>復仇1</b>。"

"<right><fancy>Thursday, December 17th, 1925</fancy></right>\n"
"It is difficult for me to convey my unabridged thoughts on the events that occurred during the summer of 1925. Of course, I gave my full account to Harlan—who I suspect is the only person willing to vouch for my story—but I have not sat down to record it on paper until now. Perhaps I would rather these events had been a figment of my imagination.\n"
"In truth, I have no idea how we made it out of the caverns beneath the jungle alive. Simply reaching the abyssal place was a hellish ordeal. My memory of our return trip is muddled and disarrayed. We scrambled in the dark for what seemed like ages. We were out of food, out of supplies, out of hope—but somehow, we found a way out.\n"
"Our reward for preventing calamity was scorn and ridicule. No upstanding paper or university would publish our findings, and of course we possessed no proof of our expedition save for our scars and nightmares. I wish I could say that my memory of these events has faded with each passing day, but I will never forget the alien city we explored in our conical bodies, the serpents that pursued us in red-litten Yoth, the formless abomination that lived in the depths of the Earth…\n"
"Perhaps that is why I fear making a written account of our findings—because these memories will crystallize and become etched in my mind, forever damning me to a life of terror and dismay. Still, the world needs to know what we saw. What we did."

"<right><fancy>1925年12月17日，星期四</fancy></right>\n"
"對於1925年夏天發生的種種事件，我很難把自己的想法隻字不落地表達出來。當然，我將自己的經歷完完整整地告訴了哈倫，因為我認為只有哈倫會願意為我的經歷佐證，但我至今還沒坐下來把它記在紙上。或許我寧願這種種事件只是出於我的想像，而非真實。\n"
"說實話，我不知道我們是怎麼活著走出叢林下方的洞穴的。光是前往那個幽深的地方，就是一場地獄般的考驗。我有關返程的記憶雜亂無章，渾渾噩噩。我們在黑暗中不段攀升，像是爬了多年一般。我們吃完了食物，耗盡了補給品，喪失了心中的希望——但不知為何，我們找到了出路。\n"
"我們阻止了災難，但獲得的獎賞卻只有嘲笑和愚弄。所有正規的新聞社或大學都不願出版我們的發現，而我們遍體麟傷，飽經噩夢，自然也顧不上為此次探險保留任何證據。我真希望自己關於這種種事件的記憶能隨著時日消去，但我永遠無法忘記我們用自己的錐形身體探索的那座怪異城市，在閃耀著紅光的幽嘶裡追擊我們的蛇群，還有居於地球深淵的無形巨怪……\n"
"或許這就是我害怕將我們的發現記錄下來的原因——因為這些記憶將會凝結，隨後蝕刻在我的腦海中，畢生困擾著我，使我終日陷於恐懼和沮喪之中。但我們的所見和經歷，都必須讓世界知曉。"

msgid "Transposed to a different time, Valusia and the children of Yig live on. Preserved by the new timeline you have created, you and the Serpent People are safe from the events that caused their homeland’s destruction long ago, in another time. All of your past transgressions against serpent-kind are forgiven, and you are given the chance to live in the paradise-kingdom of Valusia, remade in Yig’s image. Although you may have turned your back on humanity, you take comfort in the fact that the Earth has been saved from complete ruin. Due to your actions, you are valued and respected among the Serpents and in the eyes of your new Father. Your new life is cozy and full of wonders you could never have predicted. And yet, from time to time, you look out into the wilds beyond Valusia and wonder if there is something else you could have done…"
msgstr "你傳送到了另一個時空，瓦盧西亞和伊格的子嗣就居住於此。在你所創造的新時間線的保護之下，你和蛇族子民得以平安，不同於另一時空裡早早覆滅的蛇族國土。你曾對抗蛇族的罪過得到了寬恕，你獲得允許，能夠以伊格的形貌在天堂國度瓦盧西亞居住。儘管你背棄了自己的人性，但人類已經免遭巨難，得以倖存，你的心頭大石也放了下來。你的所作所為在蛇族中備受敬仰，你的新父對你青眼有加，生活舒適無比，充滿你從未預料的奇蹟。然而，你時不時地會望向瓦盧西亞另一端的荒野，想要知道自己是否還有什麼必須要做的事情……"

msgid "Transposed to a different time, Pnakotus and the Great Race of Yith live on. Preserved by the new timeline you have created, you and the Yithians are safe from the extraterrestrials who ended their kind long ago, in another time. You are brought into the city and given freedoms other captive minds never received. Although at first, you long for your former life, the emotion fades the more time you spend in this strange new Earth. You roam the world on titan airships and delve into the collective knowledge of the Yithians, accumulated in their vast archives from centuries of research. Your studies unveil secrets that no other human will ever know. You experience technological advances that humanity would weep to discover. And you prepare for an accursed future that may still yet come to pass.."
msgstr "你傳送到了另一個時空，偉大種族伊斯和納克特就存在於此。在你所創造的新時間線的保護之下，你和伊斯人得以平安，不同於另一時空裡早早毀滅於異星生命之手的伊斯文明。你被領進這座城市，獲得了其他被俘的意識體並未得到的自由。儘管一開始，你渴望你的前生，但隨著你在這陌生的嶄新地球裡度過的時日漸長，這種情緒漸漸消散。你乘坐巨大的飛艇環遊世界，研習檔案庫中伊斯人耗費數世紀研究而成的海量知識。你的研究揭開了人類前所未知的秘密，體驗了人類或會為其落淚的先進科技，而你精心準備，迎接或會降臨的災難。"

msgid "Reality as you know it will never be the same, but perhaps this is not the end of the world. After all, time is just one dimension: a dimension humanity barely understands. We experience time, but we cannot see it. We can measure it, but we cannot alter it. So what if the fourth dimension has split into hundreds of thousands of planes of existence? Our feeble human minds cannot comprehend the outcome, but the universe still survives, its ever-expanding boundaries no longer limited by the confines of time."
msgstr "你知道現世不會一成不變，但或許這不是世界末日。終究時間只是一種維度：一種人類幾乎不了解的維度。我們經歷時間，但卻看不見它；有辦法測量，但卻無法改變它。所以當第四維度被切分為成千上百個位面時，會發生什麼？我們人類的孱弱思維無法理解其後果，但宇宙仍然存在，其無限延伸的邊界不再受時間的桎梏。"

msgid "All of this was set into motion when the Eztli ruins were first intruded upon. Ichtaca’s original warning was her last vestige of humanity speaking to you. She wanted you and the other explorers to turn back, but curiosity and greed got the better of you. Until that day, balance had been kept. Alejandro sought the relic for his own devices. Ichtaca heard the call of her master and obeyed. However, humanity is the true cause of this chaos. You know now what you must do. You know now how you can save everyone."
msgstr "所有這一切都是從埃茲特里第一次遭到入侵開始的。伊塔卡最初的警告，是她最後彌留的人性在與你對話。她想要你和其他探險者離開此地，但好奇和貪婪在你心中佔了上風。在那天到來之前，一切都還保持著平衡。亞歷山卓尋找遺物，是有他自己的打算。伊塔卡聽從主人的呼喚而來，服從命令。而人類才是這場混亂的真正誘因。你知道自己必須要做什麼了。現在你知道了拯救所有人的方法。"
