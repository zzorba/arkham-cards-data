"“Gone? What do you mean she’s gone?!” Sheriff Engle demands.\n"
"“See for yourself,” the officer replies. He guides the sheriff through a long hallway flanked by holding cells. “She was guarded at all hours, trust me. One moment she was there, the next…” He stops in front of Anette’s cell, and watches as Sheriff Engle’s jaw drops. Smeared along the walls of the cell is a sticky red substance, painted in a delicate pattern. The woman is nowhere to be seen."

"“逃走了？‘她逃走了’是什麼意思？！”警長恩格爾質問道。\n"
"“你自己看吧。”警員回答。他領著警長走過一條長長的走廊，兩側都是牢房。“她二十四小時都有人看守，相信我。上一秒她還在這兒，但下一秒……”他停在安妮特的牢房門前，看著警長恩格爾驚訝地張開了嘴巴。牢房牆壁上塗抹了一種粘稠的紅色物質，描繪出精緻的圖案。那個女人不見了。"

msgid "You nod to the knight as he places the file you had requested onto your hardwood desk. Finding all of Carl Sanford’s records hadn’t been easy, but now all of the secrets of the Order were within your grasp. “What is the next step?” he asks, eager to serve. You inform him that there is to be a meeting in the sanctum this very night. “Very well. I will summon our most loyal members.” You dismiss him and turn to look out the window of your new office. The city of Arkham is as grim and moody as ever…but at least now you can protect it from the forces that lay beyond the Earth."
msgstr "騎士將你要求的文件放在你的硬木桌上，你朝他點頭致意。要找出卡爾·桑福德的所有記錄並不是件易事，但現在修道會的一切秘密都在你掌握之中。“下一步是什麼？”他急於為你效力，問道。你告訴他，今晚要在聖堂召開一場會議。“好的。我會召集我們最忠心的成員。”你讓他退下，隨後轉身望向你新辦公室的窗外。阿卡姆城一如既往的冷酷、陰鬱……但至少現在這座城的秘密掌握在你手中。"

"Anna regards you calmly as you enter. As always, her prescience is disconcerting, but by now you have gotten used to it. “I’ve been expecting you for some time,” she admits. “I suppose you have questions for me. Very well. Ask away. Though I imagine that by now you must know the answer.” She neither offers you a seat nor a drink. You begin to describe your situation, though the truth of your condition is plain to see for somebody with her gifts (and few else). You had hoped for another explanation— any explanation at all—but it was only a desperate clinging to hope, without justification. Anna gives you a pitying grimace and shakes her head. “Surely by now you must understand. You have completed your task. Your business here has concluded. Now is the time for you to rest and be at peace.”\n"
"Peace? No, you cannot be at peace! There is still so much left for you to do…!"

"你進來時，安娜平靜地看著你。一如往常，她的預見令人不安，但你已經習慣了。“我等了你好一會了。”她坦承地說，“我猜你有問題要問我。好，問吧。但我想你現在已經知道答案了。”她既不請你坐下，也不給你倒杯喝的。你開始描述你的情况，儘管某人能夠憑藉她的天賦(或是別的東西)，一眼洞穿實情。你曾希望能得到另一種解釋——不管是什麼解釋——你極度渴求希望，甚至不需要理由。安娜露出遺憾的神情，搖搖頭：“現在你得明白，你已經完成了自己的任務。你要做的事情已經完成了，是時候該休息了，安息吧。”\n"
"安息？不，你不能安息！你還有很多事情要做……！"

msgid "In your dream, a tall man approaches. His grin is full of malice. “It is time to pay your due,” he announces. “You got what you wanted. Now it is my turn.”"
msgstr "一名高挑的男子來到你的夢境之中。他的笑容充滿惡意。“你欠下的東西，是時候該還了。”他說道，“你得到了你想要的東西。現在該我了。”"

"No matter what you do, the creature’s assault on your mind never ceases. Its gaze haunts you everywhere you look. It controls your every thought—your hopes, your bonds, your fears, your ambitions. A reminder of your futile existence. Each night, you toss and turn, unable to wrench free from this sensation of worthlessness. Your thoughts turn to a grim, uncertain future. A future without life. A future without <i>you</i>. It is the one ordeal every mortal must endure, and yet the one experience no mortal could possibly describe. Ghosts? Realms beyond our mortal coil? Nothing but a last resort for a mind desperate to cling to life.\n"
"When the creature next invades, you have come to a new conclusion. An icy draft surrounds you as the thing coalesces before you. Your throat constricts and tears well in your eyes, but you stand tall. You are unafraid. The creature gazes at you curiously, and the piping of infernal flutes fades into silence. It extends its clawed hand, and you shake it. You will never truly be free from its grasp, but perhaps you and the creature can work in agreement. Perhaps you can tame your fear. It doesn’t matter if the world has no point. It’s yours, damnit, and nothing will stop you from altering it to your liking."

"無論你做什麼，這怪物都會無休止地折磨著你的意志。不論你的目光轉向何處，你總能看見它凝視著你。它控制著你的所思所想——你的希望、你的牽絆、你的恐懼、你的野心。它提醒著你，你的存在毫無意義。你感到自己一文不值，每個夜晚你輾轉反側，無法擺脫這種感覺。你的思想指引你走向一個糟糕的、不確定的未來。那裡沒有生命。也沒有你。這是每一個凡人都必須遭受的苦難，但沒有一個凡人有機會描述這段經歷。幽靈？超然塵世之外的領域？對於一個渴望得到生命的意識體來說，這就是最後的辦法。\n"
"當那怪物再次來襲，你迎來了一個新的結局。你面前的東西融合在一起，一股冰冷的氣流包圍了你。你喉嚨發緊，眼裡盈滿淚水，但你挺直了腰桿。你不害怕。怪物好奇地盯著你，旋即地獄般的笛聲消失了，歸於寂靜。它伸出一隻帶有爪子的手，你將其握住。你永遠不可能真正擺脫它的掌控，但或許你能與它達成一致。或許你能克服你的恐懼。哪怕這個世界不再具有任何意義，也沒有關係。世界就是屬於你的，管他呢，沒有什麼能夠阻止你將它改變成你喜歡的樣子。"

"“You’re a fool,” Carl Sanford says from behind bars, his tone confident. “How long do you expect this to stand?”\n"
"You know he is right. The charges brought against Sanford are flimsy at best. No judge or jury is going to believe any story about dark rituals and eldritch beings. Even if you could convince others of Sanford’s dangerous ideologies, his considerable influence and political clout ensures he’ll be released sooner than you would like. Even so, you had to separate him from his lackeys while you cleaned up his mess. You tell Sanford that you’ll be keeping an eye on him once he is out.\n"
"“And I, you,” he retorts."

"“你真蠢，”卡爾·桑福德在監牢裡說道，語氣充滿自信。“你覺得這種情況會持續多久？”\n"
"你知道他是對的。對桑福德的指控充其量十分薄弱。沒有法官或陪審團會相信任何關於黑暗儀式和恐怖生物的故事。即使你能說服其他人相信桑福德危險的思想，他巨大的影響力和政治權勢也能確保他比你預期的更早被釋放。即便如此，你還是得把他和他的手下分開，以便收拾他的爛攤子。你告訴桑福德，就算他放出去，你也會盯著他。\n"
"“彼此彼此，”他回道。"

"A cold wind blows through the silent woods, the clearing bathed in a silver glow bestowed by the full moon. “We have new blood joining our circle,” Erynn states from the center of the clearing, where Anette once stood to lead her sisters. She beckons you forward. “Our coven is bound by much more than simple association. We are a family. And we are proud to welcome you into our midst.”\n"
"With your new understanding of the universe and the forces that hold it together, you promise to use your knowledge only to maintain the balance of the world. Erynn and the others nod in agreement.\n"
"“This city is already stained with much blood,” she says. “Spilling more is not an act of cleansing. Let us be shields, and blades of vengeance no longer.”"

"冷風吹過寂靜的樹林，滿月的銀色光芒灑在空地上。“有新血加入我們的圈子，”伊琳站在空地中央說道，那裡原先是安妮特領導她的姐妹們的位置。她示意你前進。“我們的羈絆不僅僅是簡單的集會，我們是一家人。我們很榮幸地歡迎你加入我們。”\n"
"你對宇宙和維繫宇宙的力量已經有了新的認識，你承諾只會用你的知識來維持世界的平衡。伊琳與其他人點頭同意。\n"
"“這座城市已經沾滿了鮮血，”她說道。“再灑更多的血並不能清洗。讓我們作為盾牌來守護，不再成為復仇的刀刃。”"
