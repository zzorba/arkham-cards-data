"The Unvisited Isle lies in the midst of the Miskatonic River, in between two of the bridges that span the river and connect the Downtown and Rivertown neighborhoods of Arkham. Overgrown with vines, thorns, and unnatural underbrush, the island is home to no residents and very few fauna. Rows of mysterious stone pillars stand sentry throughout the island, rising high above the treetops. Though many theories abound, none know for sure what purpose these stone pillars serve, or who built them. Very few dare to venture onto the shores of the enigmatic island, and those who do return with strange tales: bonfires in the woods at the darkest hours of night—stone altars with deep carvings impossible to translate—empty woods devoid of life, save for the stark-black ravens and whippoorwills who perch on the tree branches and watch trespassers with eager eyes. Unfortunately for you, the stakes are too high for you to heed these many warnings.\n"
"The streets of Arkham are emptier and quieter than you have ever seen them before. A familiar grey mist has enveloped the town. The haze grows denser and thicker the closer you get to the river. You move with haste, not wanting to encounter any others on your way to the site of the ritual, whether they be living or dead. You find several rowboats moored by the docks and climb aboard one of them. With the waters unnaturally still and barely any current carrying the boat, rowing toward the island should be a simple endeavor. Even so, the dense fog makes it difficult for you to get your bearings. Soon, you are completely enclosed by the grey mist, unable to see the banks of the river or the coast of the island. Shapes emerge from the fog. Ripples appear on the surface of the water. The gaze of the watcher is upon you.\n"
"Just then, a pillar of spectral energy ascends into the sky, clear as day even through the haze. The shapes all turn their attention to this beacon, and you sense the watcher’s gaze slipping from your soul. The rite has begun. You row faster, using the light to guide you. It is time to decide once and for all why you have come—are you here to aid the Silver Twilight Lodge? Or to disrupt them?"

"未訪之島坐落在米斯卡塔尼克河中央。兩座橋梁橫跨河面，將其與阿卡姆的商業區和河岸城連接起來。島上長滿了藤蔓、荊棘和詭異的灌木叢，此地無人居住，動物也稀少。一排排神秘的石柱如哨兵一般佇立在島上，比樹冠還高。儘管眾說紛紜，但無一人能夠確定這些石柱有何作用，是誰人所建。膽敢登上這座神秘島嶼來探險的人少之又少，其中有人探險歸來後講述了古怪的故事：夜晚至暗時刻樹林裡燃起篝火——數座石祭壇上深深鐫刻著無法翻譯的銘文——空蕩蕩的樹林裡死氣沉沉，只有通體漆黑的烏鴉和夜鷹還棲身在樹枝上，用渴望的目光注視著入侵者。不幸的是，要注意到這麼多危險的訊號，對你來說已經是件危險的事。\n"
"阿卡姆的街道從未像現在這樣空曠、寂靜。整座城市被一團熟悉的灰霧所籠罩。你越靠近河邊，霧氣就變得越發濃重。你匆匆行進，不希望在前往儀式場所的路上遇見任何人，不論是活人還是死人。你發現碼頭邊上停著幾艘划艇，便登上了其中一艘。水面呈現出詭異的平靜，幾乎沒有水流推動這艘小艇，看來划到那座島去不是麼難事。即便如此，濃霧讓你難以辨清方向。不久，灰霧完全包圍你，使你既看不見河的兩岸，也看不見島嶼的邊界。霧中顯現出一些人影。水面泛起了漣漪。看守人正凝視著你。\n"
"就在這時，一道光能直刺天穹，即便在濃霧之中也如同白日一般清晰可見。人影齊刷刷地轉向這座燈塔，而你感覺到，看守人的視線離開了你的靈魂。儀式開始了。憑藉光芒的指引，你加快了划艇的速度。是時候最終決定你到這兒來的目的了——你是來這兒幫助銀暮秘社的嗎？還是說是為了阻止他們？"

"“What have I done? Why, I have cheated the Devil,” Sanford responds with a sinister grin. You notice the words of his tome are now glowing with a spectral radiance. “Keziah signed the Black Book of Azathoth in order to learn the secrets of the universe. A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\n"

"“A pity,” Mr. Sanford complains, “I thought you were smarter than this.” You take several steps back, retreating to where the witches are gathered. Sanford turns to the other members of his Order and points to you. “Kill them,” he commands.\n"
"“Erynn, give us cover!” Anette barks to the red-haired witch next to her. The witch nods in response and waves a wooden rod in front of her, creating a cloud of mist that masks your presence. “We have to get out of here. Go!” Anette yells.\n"
"Your escape is a blur. Robed members of the Silver Twilight cult chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you.

"“伊琳，掩護我們！”安妮特對她身旁的紅髮女巫吼道。那女巫點點頭，在身前揮舞著一根木杖，變出一團濃霧掩藏你們的行蹤。“我們得離開這兒。走吧！”安妮特喊道。\n"
"你在濃霧的掩護下逃走了。身著長袍的銀暮秘社成員奔跑在荒涼的樹林裡，無情地追趕著你。你勉強跑到岸邊，險些就要被他們追上。你向安妮特和其他女巫示意，讓她們跟你一道走，但她搖搖頭。“我們很快還會再見面的。”女巫們的斗篷沒入夜空，一個接一個消失在漆黑的漩渦中。"

"Anette approaches, confronting the remnant’s ethereal shell. “Sister! We are the ones who have called you here from the great beyond.” The shattered revenant turns its attention to Anette, and the rest of her coven watch in anticipation.\n"
"“What are you doing, you fool? This spirit is no mere witch!” Carl Sanford yells out. But it is too late. Anette ignores Mr. Sanford, continuing to speak with the spectral presence. “For years we have suffered injustice after injustice. Share with me your secrets, sister. Together, as one mind, body, and soul, we can begin anew.”\n"
"The ghost reaches out to her with a long, skeletal arm. Anette’s sisters gasp as their high priestess steps forward and kneels before the being, offering herself. With a sudden rush of energy, the phantom soul is drawn inside Anette. She collapses to the ground, reeling from the spiritual impact. Her body writhes in torment, but none of the other witches step forward to help, instead watching with equal parts terror and fascination. Finally, Anette rises to her feet, her eyes aglow with mystical power. When she speaks, it is not her voice. “Sisters. Rejoice, for I am reborn,” Keziah says.\n"
"Carl Sanford taps you with his cane. You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn’t noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge’s inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. “We must leave this place at once,” Sanford says stoically. “This being possesses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.”\n"
"Anette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. “You look familiar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.” She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul. You hate to admit it, but Sanford is right. You turn and flee with the rest of the Lodge, hoping you are fast enough to escape the witch’s magic. \n"
"Your escape is a blur. Witches and spirits chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. Other members of the Lodge are perhaps not so fortunate. Having scattered in many directions, you’re not sure how many of them escaped, and you don’t see Carl Sanford anywhere, though you suspect he had a plan for this outcome."

"安妮特走上前來，面對著亡靈那縹緲的身體。“姐姐！是我們將你從遙遠的地方呼喚到這兒的。”撕裂的亡靈注意到了安妮特，其他女巫也投去了期盼的目光。\n"
"“你在幹什麼？你這蠢貨！這個鬼魂已經不止是女巫了！”卡爾·桑福德大聲吼道。但已經太晚了。安妮特不顧桑福德的叫喊，繼續對那鬼魂說：“這些年來我們遭受了一次又一次的不公。把你的秘密分享給我吧，姐姐。來吧，讓我們合二為一，精神、肉體、靈魂都融於一體，重新開始。\n"
"那幽靈對她伸出一根瘦長的枯骨手臂。安妮特的姐妹們呼吸急促，看著自己的女祭司步上前去，跪在鬼魂面前，獻出自己的肉體。一股力量突然湧出，那鬼魂被安妮特吸入體内。她精神受到衝擊，一陣眩暈倒在地上。她身體痛苦地扭動著，但其他女巫沒有一人上前施救，而是全都看著她，面帶恐懼與陶醉。最後，安妮特站起身來，眼睛閃耀著神秘力量的光芒。她說話時已不是她原來的嗓音。“姐妹們。慶祝我的重生吧。”凱夏說道。\n"
"卡爾·桑福德用手杖輕輕碰你。你被眼前發生的事情驚呆了，全然沒有注意到秘社的成員正悄悄離開這片空地。一名秘社核心圈成員舉起左輪手槍，想要開槍，但女祭司只注視著他，他的手臂便在你眼前萎縮、腐爛。他手槍咔嗒掉落在地，發出最後一聲嚎叫，最後他歸於虛無，只在地上剩下一個腐爛的軀殼。“我們必須馬上離開這裡。”桑福德堅定地說，“那鬼魂掌握著高於生死本身的力量。我們再也沒法傷她分毫。\n"
"安妮特——不，是凱夏——轉向你，雙眼閃耀著光芒。“你看起來很熟悉，孩子。來吧，過來。別害怕。你不需要害怕我。”她居心叵測地獰笑著，聲音像是尖刀一般刺進你的靈魂。你不想承認，但桑福德說得對。你轉身和秘社成員們一起逃跑，只盼自己能跑快些，從那女巫的魔力之下逃脫。\n"
"你在濃霧的掩護下逃走了。女巫和幽靈在荒涼的樹林裡無情地追趕著你。你勉強跑到岸邊，險些就要被他們追上。其他的秘社成員或許就沒這麼幸運了。你和他們分頭逃跑，不確定他們有多少人逃出去了，而你到處都看不見卡爾·桑福德的蹤影，但你猜測他對現在的局勢早有對策。"

"When you come to your senses, the wind has subsided and the dark mist has vanished. With the ritual concluded, the island seems to have returned to normal—but was the ritual successful, or did it fail? You make your way to the center of the island to find out what happened. As you arrive, you find Anette and her coven heavily wounded, and the Lodge stands victorious. Carl Sanford holds a thick leather tome in his hands, its pages glowing with arcane power. “What have you done?!” Anette yells. Several members of her coven surround her. They are embattled, but you have no doubt they would lay down their life to protect their high priestess from harm.\n"
"“What have I done? Why, I have cheated the Devil,” Sanford responds with a sinister grin. You notice the words of his tome are now glowing with a spectral radiance. “Keziah signed the Black Book of Azathoth in order to learn the secrets of the universe. A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\n"
"Anette clenches her jaw and turns toward you. “Listen to me. You cannot even begin to fathom the secrets this monster now possesses. You must stop him, no matter the cost.”\n"
"You hold your tongue, but in the back of your mind, you suspect Anette is right. Sanford has tricked you. This is what he was after all along. Perhaps he considers this “protecting humanity,” but the truth is that he has endangered the lives of others over and over again in order to serve his own greed and lust for power. However, before you can confront Sanford, he turns to the other members of his Order and points to you. “This one is no longer useful,” he explains. “Kill them all.”\n"
"“Erynn, give us cover!” Anette barks to the red-haired witch next to her. The witch nods in response and waves a wooden rod in front of her, creating a cloud of mist that masks your presence. “We have to get out of here. Go!” Anette yells.\n"
"Your escape is a blur. Robed members of the Silver Twilight cult chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. You motion for Anette and the others to join you, but she shakes her head. “We’ll meet again soon.” The edges of the witches’ cloaks bleed into the night sky, and with a swirl of darkness, they vanish one by one."

"當你意識回復，風已停息，黑霧也已經消失。儀式完成後，整座島似乎已經恢復正常——但儀式是成功了，還是失敗了呢？你走向島嶼中央，看看發生了什麼事情。到達後，你發現安妮特和女巫集會的其他人身負重傷，這一役是秘社贏了。卡爾·桑福德手裡捧著一本厚厚的皮質書籍，書頁正發出神秘的光芒。“你都做了什麼？！“安妮特喊道。幾名女巫集會的成員圍在她身側。她們嚴陣以待，無疑不惜犧牲性命也要保護自己的高階女祭司。\n"
"“我做了什麼？多此一問，我欺騙了魔鬼。”桑福德露出邪惡的笑容，回答道。你發現他書上的文字發出了幽靈的光芒。“凱夏為了得到宇宙之秘，在阿撒托斯的黑書簽下了姓名。在我看來，這是一個致命的錯誤，因為她讓自己落入了他人掌控之中，而且對方遠比她要強大得多。他開始翻讀那本書籍，同時繼續解釋：“她付出了代價，但採摘這果實的人是我。”\n"
"安妮特朝你轉過身來，咬緊牙關。“聽我說。你根本不懂那鬼魂掌握了怎樣的秘密。你得阻止他，不惜任何代價。”\n"
"你沉默不語，但在你心底裡，你覺得安妮特說的是對的。桑福德騙了你。一直以來他都在欺騙你。或許他認為這是在“保護人類”，但實際上他貪求權力，一次又一次將他人置於危險的境地。但你還沒有機會面對桑福德，他便指著你，轉身對修道會的其他成員命令道：“這個人已經沒用了。”他說道，“把他們全都殺了。”\n"
"“伊琳，掩護我們！”安妮特對她身旁的紅髮女巫吼道。那女巫點點頭，在身前揮舞著一根木杖，變出一團濃霧掩藏你們的行蹤。“我們得離開這兒。走吧！”安妮特喊道。\n"
"你在濃霧的掩護下逃走了。身著長袍的銀暮秘社成員奔跑在荒涼的樹林裡，無情地追趕著你。你勉強跑到岸邊，險些就要被他們追上。你向安妮特和其他女巫示意，讓她們跟你一道走，但她搖搖頭。“我們很快還會再見面的。”女巫們的斗篷沒入夜空，一個接一個消失在漆黑的漩渦中。"

As you arrive, you find Carl Sanford and the other members of his Order heavily wounded, and Anette and her coven stand victorious. Anette stands at the center of the clearing, her eyes aglow with mystical power. When she speaks, it is not her voice. “Sisters. Rejoice, for I am reborn,” Keziah says.\n"
"Carl Sanford taps you with his cane. You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn’t noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge’s inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. “We must leave this place at once,” Sanford says stoically. “This being possesses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.”\n"
"Anette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. “You look familiar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.” She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul. You hate to admit it, but Sanford is right. You turn and flee with the rest of the Lodge, hoping you are fast enough to escape the witch’s magic.\n"
