msgid "Scenario VII: In the Clutches of Chaos"
msgstr "冒險VII：混沌魔掌"

msgid "After what you saw at the Unvisited Isle, your faith in humanity is on thin ice. You feel like a wayward spirit, wandering the streets with no destination in mind. You wish you could just return home and forget everything that has happened in the last few weeks, but you know that is just a pipe dream. After hours of aimless meandering, you snap back to reality when you realize you have wandered into Independence Square. A soft breeze carries a trail of brittle leaves across the grass of the clearing, drawing your eyes upward. There, sitting amidst a circle of autumn-colored leaves, sits Anna Kaslow. Her eyes are closed in a deep trance, her fingers pressed against the temples of her head. Laid out on the grass in front of her is a wool blanket, and on top of that, a circle of overlapping facedown tarot cards. You approach and take a seat in front of the fortune teller. It’s only now that you realize just how sore and tired you are. Every one of your muscles aches with pain, and it takes a significant amount of effort for you to not immediately pass out."
msgstr "在你親眼目睹未訪之島的景象過後，你對人類的信任已所剩無幾。你像個遊魂，漫無目的在街上遊蕩，你真希望自己能回家去，把這幾個星期發生的事情都忘掉，但你知道這是不可能的。漫無目的地遊蕩了數小時後，你意識到自己走進了獨立廣場，這時你很快回過神來。柔和的微風把脆弱的樹葉吹落，掃過空曠的草坪，吸引你抬眼望去。安娜·卡斯洛就坐在秋葉形成的一個圓圈中間。她深陷恍惚之中，閉著眼睛，手指按壓著太陽穴。她面前的草坪上放著一條羊毛毯子，上面擺放著面朝下的塔羅牌，一張壓著一張擺作一個圓圈。你走過去，坐在占卜師前方。你現在才意識到你是多麼痛苦，多麼疲憊。你身上的每一塊肌肉在發疼，得拼命堅持才能不讓自己痛暈過去。"

msgid "You recognize the soothsayer from your investigation into the disappearances at Josef Meiger’s manor. It was her advice that led the second set of victims to their doom, or so you suspect. Oddly enough, she appears to recognize you, as well. She runs her fingers along the circle of cards before her. “I suspect the past few weeks have been quite arduous for you. Are you here for guidance?” You grimace. The last time Anna read somebody’s fortune, it did not end well for them. What makes you think you will be any different?"
msgstr "你認出了這位占卜師，你在調查約瑟夫·梅吉爾莊園的失蹤事件時見過她。她給的建議導致了第二批受害者的死亡，至少你是這麼認為的。奇怪的是，她似乎也認出了你。她的手指摸著面前的一圈塔羅牌：“我猜過去的幾個禮拜你過得很艱難。你是來尋求指引的嗎？”你面露苦澀。安娜上一次解讀他人的命運時，對方並沒有得到一個好下場。你憑什麼覺得她這一次占卜會不一樣？"

msgid "Anna opens her eyes. “I was wondering when we would meet again.” You wonder aloud how she could possibly not know, when everything else she has predicted has come to pass. Your remark earns you a hearty chuckle from the soothsayer. “That doesn’t mean I know everything, my dear.” She runs her fingers across the circle of cards. “I suspect the past few weeks have been quite arduous for you. Are you here for more guidance?” You grimace. This all began with a reading of your fortune. What makes you think another reading will make this all go away?"
msgstr "安娜睜開眼睛。“我剛正在想我們什麼時候會再見面。你大聲質問她，她預言的一切都成真了，怎麼可能不知道。你的話換來了占卜師的大笑：“那不代表我知道一切呀，親愛的。”她的手指穿過面前的一圈塔羅牌：“我猜過去的幾個禮拜你過得很艱難。你又來尋求指引嗎？”你面露苦澀。這一切都是從你占卜命運開始的。你憑什麼認為再占卜一次就能讓這一切都消失？"

"Before you can answer, Anna turns over the card closest to her. It depicts a furtive hooded figure with five swords embedded in the ground around it. Others cower and flee before the victorious figure, and a maelstrom of dark clouds brew over its head. Above this image, the card reads: FIVE OF SWORDS. “You may feel as though you have been defeated, but you must not give in to despair. The battle may be over, but your struggle has not yet ended.” Misery catches in your throat. You want nothing more than for this nightmare to be over, but Anna’s words ring true: you know it will not end unless you put an end to it yourself.\n"
"A flash of light burns across the sky, followed swiftly by a resounding crack of thunder. The clouds above are not natural. Phantasmal shapes shift and churn within the mist above. If you listen closely, you can faintly hear their howls of pain and sadness drifting on the wind. “It has begun,” Anna utters quietly. You rise to your feet, ignoring your exhaustion, your pain, and your fear."

"你還沒來得及回答，安娜就翻開了最近的一張塔羅牌。上面畫著一個神秘的兜帽人，周圍的地上插著五把劍。他儼然凱旋得勝，頭頂醞釀著一團烏雲，其他人則從他面前退縮、逃走。在圖畫上寫著這張牌的名字：“寶劍五”。“你可能感覺自己已經被打敗了，但干萬不要因絕望而放棄。戰爭或許已經結束，但你仍需奮鬥。“你喉頭一陣苦澀。你只希望這場噩夢完結，但安娜說的聽起來像是實話：你知道，只有你親手將它終結，它才會結束。\n"
"一道閃電劃破夜空，接著一道雷鳴轟然巨響。上空的烏雲有異樣。有幻影在上空雲霧中移動、攪動。要是你仔細聆聽，你可以隱約聽到他們疼痛與悲傷的號叫聲在風中飄蕩。“已經開始了。”安娜平靜地說道。你將自己的力竭、疼痛、恐懼抛在腦後，站起身來。"

msgid "Breaches and Incursions"
msgstr "裂口與入侵"

msgid "In this scenario, doom does not accrue at the usual rate. Instead, breaches—represented by resource tokens—are placed on locations. When enough breach tokens have been placed on a single location, an <b>incursion</b> occurs, which adds doom to that location and causes breaches to open in connecting locations. The investigators’ primary goal in this scenario should therefore be to prevent incursions from happening by removing breaches from locations. This can only be done using the abilities on each location."
msgstr "在本場冒險中，毀滅標記的增速與平常不同。會有以資源標記表示的裂口放置在地點上。當一個地點上放置了足夠數量的裂口標記，發生一次<b>入侵</b>，在該地點上放置毀滅標記並導致裂口在其連接地點打開。因此，調查員在本場冒險的主要目標是通過移除地點上的裂口來防止入侵發生。只能通過使用每個地點的能力來達到該目標。"

During the “place 1 doom on the current agenda” step of the mythos phase, instead of placing doom on Agenda 1a, the investigators must choose 3 different locations, at random.

"The spirit cackles as she hears your words, but her laughter is soon cut short. Emerging from the trees, the remainder of Anette’s coven–led by the red-haired witch Erynn–surround Anette wordlessly. Erynn gives you a solemn nod, her conviction showing through her stern demeanor. Understanding why they have come, you step aside and allow them to do their work.\n"
"One of the witches draws a circle in the dirt around Anette, while the rest bind her with tendrils of searing energy. The revenant shrieks and wails in agony, but the witches dare not cease. Finally, as their chants rise to a crescendo, Erynn pierces the sanctity of the circle with her knife, pressing firmly against the air and straining as though she were attempting to pierce solid stone. Keziah’s ghost departs in a whirl of spectral mist, dissipating into thin air with a final cry. Anette’s body, unsupported, collapses to the ground. “It’s over,” you say, placing a hand on Erynn’s shoulder.\n"
"“No,” she replies harshly, gesturing to the sky above. The storm clouds have all disappeared, yet you count not a single star in the night sky. The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not even realized it was there. How long had it loomed over the city while you spent your time warding against lesser incursions?\n"
"You ask what can be done to close a breach of such size. She clenches her jaw. “I don’t know. But I know who does.” She kneels over Anette, raises her hand, and slaps her hard across the face. Anette jerks awake, startled out of her catatonic state.\n"
"“Is this what you wanted, sister?” Erynn drags her to her feet, forcing her to look up at the catastrophe she has wrought.\n"
"“You know it isn’t,” Anette replies, her voice ragged. “I only wanted us all to have some semblance of the strength she possessed. I had no desire to use it in the same way she did. But the spirit took control, and I could not resist.” She lowers her head in resignation. “I’m sorry, sisters. I failed us all. I was not strong enough.”"

"“姐姐，這就是你要的嗎？”伊琳把她拉了起來，強迫她抬頭看自己一手釀造的大禍。\n"
"“這不是，你知道的。”安妮特聲音顫抖著回答，“我只是想讓我們每個人都分得她的力量。我無意像那幽靈一樣運用力量作惡。但當時它主導了一切，我無力抗拒。”她無奈地垂下頭來，“對不起，妹妹。我讓大家失望了。是我當時還不夠強大。”"
