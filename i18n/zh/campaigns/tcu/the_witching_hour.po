"It is a breezy November evening in Arkham—the perfect night for a walk through Independence Square, or so you had thought, up until the moment Anna Kaslow offered to tell your fortune. You agreed, though you would soon come to regret this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck, she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune. Judgment. Temperance. Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n"
"“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

"這夜涼風習習，是阿卡姆十一月的一個夜晚——這個晚上在獨立廣場散個步再好不遇，或者說在安娜·卡斯洛主動給你算命之前，你是這麼認為的。你答應讓她給你算命，但你很快就後悔了遭個決定。吉普賽占卜師從牌庫裡抽出的每一張牌，都编織出—個絕望與不幸的故事。審判。節制。正義。隱士。倒吊人。教皇。戀人。戰車。命運之输。安娜即将完成占卜，她抽出最顶上的塔羅牌，将它放在牌陣中央。牌陣中最為重要的這張牌残破、考舊，上面畫有不样的圖紧：高聳的黑璃瑙建築。暴風雨如同地獄股在塔頂肆虐，高雲裡一道閃電落下。這張牌寫著：高塔·XV。雖然接下來的解牌都很顺利，但看到中央的那張牌還是讓你打了個寒颤。此時此刻，它就像一副合上棺蓋的棺材，盛装著你的屁體。\n"
"“你跟我說過，讓我直接把它給你。”占卜師說道。她盤腿坐在你面前，表情冷酷。從她堅定的目光和冷酷的眼神，你看得出安娜並不满足於這次解牌。“如果只是不幸，你是不會紧張的。”她解釋說，“這關係生死。”她望向高塔周圍的塔羅牌——它們全都呈現逆位——專注地盯著這些牌。“你看不見的一切都與你對立。唯揭你一人擋了它們的路。”她神秘兮兮地說。"

msgid "The woman nods and draws the top card of the deck with a steady hand, revealing it to you without looking at it herself. Depicted on the card is a single wooden wand, surrounded by a pattern of broken stained glass. It reads: ACE OF RODS. “You must be ready to act,” she advises. “Without hesitation. Without regret. When the opportunity arises, you must set into motion the events that will change this fate.”"
msgstr "安娜點了點頭，沉穩地抽出了牌庫最頂上的牌，沒有看那張牌的内容，直接對你亮牌。那張牌上畫的是一根木質權杖，周圍是破損的彩繪玻璃。遣張牌寫著：權杖王牌。“你必須準備好探取行動。”她提出建議，“别猶豫。别後悔。機會來臨的时候，你必須行動起來改斐命運。”"

將這2張牌加入自己的牌組。調查員隊長獲得這些卡牌，它們不計入該調查員的卡牌張數。（如果上述卡牌中有任何卡牌不可用，跳過本步驟。）"

msgid "The woman smirks. “Yes, in a sense, I suppose it is,” she responds. With a single swift motion, she picks up each of the cards displayed before you, save for The Tower card, and shuffles them back into the deck. “The cards only reveal and advise. They cannot influence or impose.” She locks eyes with you, and her smile vanishes from her face. “In other words, though your fate is not set in stone, I assure you the danger you face is not ‘bullshit.’ It is real.” Her eyes narrow. “It is very real.”"
msgstr "安娜得意地笑了。“沒錯，在某種意義上說，我希望這是一派胡言。”她重複道。她快速地拿起所有擺在你面前的塔羅牌，留下高塔牌在桌面，将其餘塔羅牌洗回了牌庫。“塔羅牌只會揭示和建議，不會影響，也不會強加。”她的眼神鎖定了你，笑容從她臉上消失。“換句話來說，雖然你的命運未成定数，但我向你保證，你面臨的危險可不是什麽‘一派胡言’，而是真寶存在的。”她的眼睛眯了起来，“非常真實。”"

"Silence hangs in the air as you peer into The Tower card. The world around you dissolves into emptiness as your eyes fixate on the onyx tower. Rolling thunder echoes in the distance. “Do you understand now?” Anna asks. There is no other sign of the soothsayer: only her strained voice. A bolt of lightning streaks across the sky. “Do you see your fate before you, as I do?”\n"
"Another resounding crack of thunder, and you are suddenly awake. Icy rain pelts your body, soaking you through to the bone. You are lying in the mud beside a wooded trail, and there is no other soul in sight…"
msgstr ""
"你看著高塔牌的時候，空氣中籠罩著寂靜。你的雙眼凝視著黑瑪瑙高塔，周圍的世界溶為虚空。遠方迥響著滚滚的雷聲。“你現在懂了嗎？”安娜問道。你不見占卜師的跳影：只聽見她紧張的聲音。一道閃電劃遇夜空。“你是不是跟我一樣，也看見了自己未來的命運？”\n"
"又一道雷聲巨響，你突然醒來。冰冷的雨水打在你身上，將你徹底淋濕。你躺在泥地裡，旁邊是一條樹木繁茂的小路，視野裡—個人都没有……"

"Despite her wounds, the leader of the coven rises to her feet. More of the hooded figures emerge from the tree line, eager to defend their leader. “Interloper!” one calls you, pulling off her hood and pointing a gnarled wooden rod in your direction. Her bright-red hair glows in the firelight, embers dancing about her extended hand. “They’re the ones from before, High Priestess: the ones who interfered with our great work.”\n"
"The “High Priestess” holds up a single hand, and a hush falls over the other witches. “As always, I admire your perseverance, sister. But I do not believe these are the ones you speak of,” she replies to the red-haired accuser. You lower your weapons as several of the hooded figures approach and surround their leader. They begin chanting in a soft tone as they examine her wounds. The red-haired witch crosses her arms and watches you with a hard glare, her gaze never straying far from you. “I am Anette,” says the leader of the coven, “and these are my sisters. Tell me: Who are you, and why are you here?”\n"
"You explain how you awoke in the woods, how you were attacked by terrible creatures, and how you came to the center of this circle in order to break the spell surrounding the woods. Anette’s eyes narrow as she hears your story. “That is impossible. The circle was closed. None could enter the woods while we were completing our spell.” She grits her teeth. “You must go at once. This is not your place.”\n"
"“But, High Priestess!—” the red-haired witch exclaims, only to be interrupted by Anette’s gaze. The two lock eyes, a battle of wills that quickly proves Anette victorious.\n"
"“Stand down, Erynn,” Anette says with a firm, motherly tone, as though admonishing a child. She turns her attention back to you as the witch named Erynn lowers her head in defeat. “Go. You’ve broken the spell, just as you desired. You can leave the woods now. But I give you one final warning: cross us again, and we will not be so merciful.”\n"
"You begin to protest, but before you are able to utter a single word, a dark gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing.
