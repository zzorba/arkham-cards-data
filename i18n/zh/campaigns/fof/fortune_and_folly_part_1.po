msgid "MAN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING TWICE MINUTES AFTER WINNING BIG! This sensational headline is what first grabbed your attention. You might have written it off as just an extraordinary and unlikely event exaggerated to sell papers, if it weren't for the other stories that followed, all centering around the same place: a casino in Monte Carlo called Défis de la Roulette. In addition to the unlucky patron being struck down mere moments after leaving the casino with his winnings, others have also met grisly yet improbable fates either within or nearby. Upon inquiring further, it seems that this casino appeared quickly and unexpectedly, and the authorities in Monaco have been suspiciously tight-lipped about where exactly it came from and who owns it. Since its opening, the casino has been a magnet for the unnatural and implausible. The more you learn, the more it seems worth at least taking a look to determine whether these events are simply coincidence, or the result of something much more sinister."
msgstr "兩道閃電擊中大獎贏家！這個聳動的標題是第一篇引起你注意的報導，你一開始認為這只是記者為了吸引讀者而誇大的事件。但在短時間內，幾個類似的事件接連發生，而且全都圍繞著同個地點：蒙特卡羅一座名為輪盤挑戰的賭場。不只是那些滿載而歸的賭客，血腥的厄運也降臨在賭場中或附近地區的民眾身上。在深入調查後，你發現這座賭場崛起的非常突然而快速，更可疑的是，摩納哥政府當局對於賭場的來歷跟經營者的資訊守口如瓶。自從賭場開幕，這裡似乎吸引了許多超自然跟無法解釋的事件。你越深入調查，越確定自己必須走一趟，親眼確認這些事件是詭異的巧合；還是背後藏有更大的陰謀。"

msgid "Your cell has been given the name of a contact at Défis de la Roulette: Isamara Ordoñez. Isamara is not just an employee there, she is the \"Flor de Nicaragua,\" a singer whose performances have become a major draw for the casino. She has repeatedly reached out to various parties for help over the course of the past month, concerned with some of the events she has witnessed behind the scenes. The Foundation has reason to believe a Key may be involved in these strange events. You find a table in the casino lounge, and wait for an opportune moment to attract her attention. Only a few minutes later, a woman in a striking red dress takes the stage. Her performance is so captivating that she is already leaving the stage before you remember why you are here. There is no doubt that she is the one you are looking for. As she glances at the crowd, you give a small wave. At first, she appears to take little notice, but then her eyes fall to the flower that you were told to wear. She approaches your table and sits down. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"If you were sent by Them, its not safe to talk here. Meet me in an hour.\" She hands you a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance!\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. Hope to see you again soon!\""
msgstr "你取得了一個名字：伊薩瑪拉·奧多涅斯，她是你在輪盤挑戰中的聯絡人。伊薩瑪拉不是普通員工，她是被稱為“尼加拉瓜之花”的歌手，她的表演是賭場的主要賣點。據說她在過去幾個月秘密幫助了幾個想調查這些奇異事件的組織，她對於自己在幕後目擊到的一些事件非常擔憂。根據目前掌握的情報，基石相信這些超自然事件背後有密鑰的力量作祟。你在賭場交誼廳的一張空桌坐下，等待引起她注意的時機。幾分鐘後，一名女子身穿一襲令人驚豔的紅色禮服走上舞台，她的表演攝人心魄，一直到她走下舞台，你才重新想起自己前來的原因。毫無疑問，她就是你要找的人。當她掃視人群時，你向她低調的揮手。一開始她似乎並沒有注意，但接著她看見了你配戴的花，這是你們約定好的暗號。她走到你的桌子旁坐下，臉上掛著輕鬆的微笑，但話語卻緊繃而尖銳：“這裡不安全，一個小時後跟我碰面。”她將一張卡片塞進你手中，上面寫著附近一間咖啡廳的地址。她隨即起身，撫平禮服上的皺褶。“謝謝各位的讚美！”她向所有觀眾說，“希望很快能再相見！”"

msgid "Although you ask around town about the casino for several days, promising leads seem to be scarce. When you visit the casino itself, nothing appears out of place, although your probing questions don't go entirely unnoticed. As you sit in the casino lounge, assessing whether the trip to Monte Carlo was a complete waste of time and if nothing is amiss here after all, a woman in a striking red dress sits down at your table. You recognize her as Isamara Ordoñez, the singer who had performed just moments before, capturing the audience with her hauntingly beautiful voice. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"You're being too careless. We can't talk here. If you want to know the truth, meet me in an hour.\" She hands vou a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance,\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. \"Hope to see you again soon!\""

"Isamara is wearing a long overcoat of the darkest blue when you meet, her wavy brown hair partially hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Clearly, she is worried about someone recognizing her. \"You're right to be suspicious about what's happening at Défis,\" she begins, wasting no time with pleasantries. \"On the surface, it's a casino like any other. But there's more going on than anyone could guess, Behind the scenes, a cult called the Fortune's Chosen are the ones that really run the show. They are deadly and dangerous. Anyone who has gotten too close to the truth or crossed the casino in some way has met a horrible fate.\"\n"
"You ask about the casino owner, and how involved he is with this cult. Isamara gives a mirthless smile. \"Abarran? He is their leader. Not just that, he is the worst of them all. He brought the casino here, but more importantly, he brought the Wellspring.\"\n"
"Isamara explains that the vault of the casino holds a strange and powerful relic of mysterious origin. It is this relic that is responsible for the unlikely events that seem to pop up around the casino. This item is known as the Wellspring of Fortune, and it has the power to manipulate probability and luck. Abarran guards it jealously, as whoever possesses the Wellspring is able to turn fortune to their cause, no matter how selfish and destructive that cause may be. Over time, he has created the loyal cadre of the Fortune's Chosen by granting them some measure of the benefits of the Wellspring. They have come to revere it almost as a god. These true believers can be easily distinguished from the regular casino employees by the distinctive coin medallions they wear around their necks. \"Abarran trusts me for some reason, and he's even offered me to join. I think he views me as a potential asset,\" Isamara mutters.\n"
"You ask Isamara what she would have you do. \"Steal the Wellspring. Take it far away from here. I don't know how to say it more plainly. As long as it is in Abarran's grasp, he will use it to aggrandize himself. Even worse, I fear that the longer its powers are used, the greater the chance of harm coming to those in the casino. Who knows what seemingly impossible catastrophes it may summon if it is not removed?\"\n"
"Her words seem not so much a plea for help as a call to action. You find yourself agreeing to the task almost without conscious thought. As you move to stand, she stops you with her hand.\n"
"\"One last thing: do not underestimate Abarran. He is a dangerous man. He puts on a face of civility to the world, but underneath that mask there is a barely contained anger that can explode if he feels his prize is threatened. I've seen his temper, and I don't doubt it could drive him to tear a man limb from limb with his bare hands if he felt he had the cause.\" Left with that cheery thought, you begin planning a heist with the highest stakes."

"伊薩瑪拉來時穿著深藍色的風衣，寬邊帽下露出一縷捲曲的棕髮。很顯然她不希望被認出來。她沒有浪費時間寒暄，直接切入重點：“你對賭場的懷疑是對的。表面上它只是一般的賭場，但背後其實有常人難以想像的力量。幕後黑手是一個名為‘時運之子’的邪教，他們才是真正的掌權者。他們極度危險，任何太接近真相或阻礙他們的人都會面臨悽慘的命運。”\n"
"你詢問賭場老闆是誰，他又跟邪教有什麼關聯。伊薩瑪拉苦笑著說：“你是說阿巴蘭吧？他就是首領，不只如此，他還是他們之中最糟的。是他把賭場帶來這裡，更重要的是，他帶來了‘泉源’。”\n"
"伊薩瑪拉說賭場的金庫中放著一個充滿力量的神祕遺物。就是它導致賭場那些奇異事件發生。這件物品叫做時運泉源，它具有操縱機率跟運氣的力量。阿巴蘭不允許任何人靠近它，它能讓幸運永遠眷顧它的擁有者，不管出於多自私的行為，甚至能造成毀滅。長年來他收攏了一群忠誠的使徒，利用遺物的力量給予他們一些小恩小惠以控制他們，他們將這件遺物奉為神明。很容易區別那些信徒跟一般的賭場員工，他們脖子上都會帶著獨特、外型像錢幣的護身符。“阿巴蘭出於某種原因而信任我，他甚至邀請我加入。也許他將我視為某種有潛力的資產。”伊薩瑪拉呢喃著說。\n"
"你問伊薩瑪拉希望你怎麼做。“我想不到委婉的說法，所以我就直說了：偷走時運泉源，把它帶離這裡。只要它還在阿巴蘭手中，他就會繼續利用它來造成悲劇。更可怕的是，我害怕越是使用它的力量，人們就會遭受更大的危險，誰知道它還能招來多巨大的災難？”\n"
"她不像是在請求幫助，反而比較像在下達命令，但你還是想都沒想就答應了。你準備起身離開時，她拉住了你的手。\n"
"“最後一件事：別低估了阿巴蘭，他非常危險。他在別人面前帶著一張文明的面具，但在偽裝之下是滿腔的怒火，如果他發現有人覬覦自己的東西，就會毫不猶豫的爆發出來。我見識過他的怒氣，我毫不懷疑他能徒手將人五馬分屍，如果他覺得有必要的話。”你帶著這個令人“振奮”的消息離開，開始籌畫一場驚天劫案。"
