msgid "With the stakeout completed, the time has come to plan out the actual heist. There are only a few days until Saturday night at Défis de la Roulette, the busiest night of the week and the perfect time to get lost in a crowd. The plan for the heist is simple, at least in theory. With the casino staff and security occupied by the Saturday crowd, you will first enter the public areas, just as you did last time. There, you will try to avoid notice as much as you can while completing any needed tasks. Once that's done, you will slip into the restricted areas in the back of the casino that are reserved for staff. This area holds the vault itself, where the Wellspring of Fortune is located. According to Isamara, the vault door is not only secured by solid steel, but also held shut by some kind of energy. If that wasn't enough, it is constantly monitored by guards, patrols, and the cultists of the Fortune's Chosen. It will take a carefully executed plan, and some improvisation, to succeed against all odds. With only a short time to gather supplies and practice the approach, there may not be enough time to rest and recuperate from your first tangle with the casino."
msgstr "你完成了準備工作，是時候進行真正的劫案了。離週六只剩幾天，那是輪盤挑戰一週中最忙碌的時候，很適合在人潮的掩護下消失。計畫很簡單，至少理論上是這樣。當賭場員工跟保全被週六的人潮忙得焦頭爛額時，你首先會進入開放區域，就像上次一樣。接著在避免引起注意的狀況下完成所需的任務。完成後你就能溜進禁止進入的員工區域，也就是金庫的所在位置，時運泉源就鎖在裡面。據伊薩瑪拉所說，金庫大門不只是厚重的鋼鐵，還有某種能量保持其封閉。棘手的還不止這個，守衛會全天候監視著大門，還可能遇上巡邏隊或時運之子。你必須非常小心的執行計畫，並隨機應變，才能克服所有困難。所剩的時間不多，你必須找齊裝備、進行演練。在你與賭場正面交鋒前沒多少時間可以休息了。"
