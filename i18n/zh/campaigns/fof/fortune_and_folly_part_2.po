msgid "Only a few hours remain until the heist begins. Isamara paces nervously in front of you before taking a deep breath to calm her nerves. She steps forward to the table where a map of the casino is displayed. With one hand, she gestures toward it. \"I m still not sure exactly how you're going to pull this off, but this is what I know...\""
msgstr "離開始行動只剩幾個小時。伊薩瑪拉焦急的來回踱步，不斷深呼吸來緩解自己的緊張。她走到展示著賭場平面圖的桌邊，用一隻手指著它說：“我還是不確定你要怎麼讓計畫成功，但我會盡力告訴你我所知的東西……”"

msgid "Together with Isamara, you examine the relic that was the source of all this trouble. Sometimes it looks just like an ordinary coin, albeit an incredibly ancient one from some long forgotten civilization. At other times, however, the air around it distorts and warps. You also know now from experience the ways in which it can make the seemingly impossible all too real. For the first time, you see a genuine smile on Isamara's face. \"I have to thank you for this. For getting it out of Abarran's hands. And getting it away from this place. I don't know what would have happened if you didn't. Tonight was bad enough, but nothing would have stopped Abarran from holding tight to his prize, no matter how many died along the way.\" You begin to gather your things, as Isamara does the same. You know that you will need to leave Monte Carlo immediately, as any of the Fortune's Chosen who have survived, including Abarran himself, will hunt for you and the Wellspring. \"I saw him one last time, before we escaped,\" Isamara explains, \"The look of rage in his eyes... Without his precious artifact he'll be even more unstable.\" You tell her that maybe he is the one that should be scared instead. After all, she successfully orchestrated his downfall from within. At your words, that same smile crosses her face once more. \"I could get used to that idea.\" With everything ready to go and the Wellspring in hand, you leave Monte Carlo behind, hoping your luck will hold."
msgstr "你跟伊薩瑪拉一起檢視著這個遺物，一切麻煩的源頭。有時候它看起來就只是普通的錢幣，來自某個遠古以前、早已被遺忘的文明。但在某些時刻，它周遭的空氣中會出現扭曲或模糊的狀況。現在你從過往的經驗中得知它的確具有將不可能化為可能的力量。伊薩瑪拉笑著說，這是你第一次看到她露出真心的笑容：“我得謝謝你，將它從阿巴蘭的魔掌中拿走，並帶離這個地方。我不知道如果你失敗的話會發生什麼事，今晚已經夠糟了，但如果讓阿巴蘭繼續持有它的話，不管有多少人受害，他都不會停止使用這股力量。”你跟伊薩瑪拉開始收拾自己的東西，你們知道自己必須立刻離開蒙特卡羅，因為任何還存活的時運之子，包括阿巴蘭自己，都會為了時運泉源獵殺你們。“我在逃離前看到他最後一眼。”伊薩馬拉說道，“他的雙眼中充滿了憤怒……失去他的寶貝必定會讓他變得更不穩定。”你告訴她，或許阿巴蘭才是該感到害怕的人，畢竟她在他的眼皮子底下策劃一切，還親手讓他垮台。伊薩瑪拉聽到這又再度露出真摯的笑容：“我喜歡這個想法。”一切都準備好後，你帶著泉源離開蒙特卡羅，希望幸運始終眷顧你。"

msgid "By all accounts, escaping from the clutches of those horrible creatures and an army of casino staff and security could be called a successful night. Yet the Wellspring, the whole purpose for this ill-fated heist, has eluded your grasp. In the days that follow, you wonder if you are courageous or mad enough to try again, but the casino never reopens its doors and there is no further sign of Abarran or the Fortune's Chosen. The newspapers are strangely muted regarding the night's events, making no mention of the fantastical monsters that terrorized casino patrons. More than ever, it seems that some person or group helped Abarran set up his operation here and is protecting him after the fact as well. More importantly, after your attempted heist and the strange dimensional incursion, Abarran has taken the Wellspring somewhere far from here. It is possible that you could track him down and find some other way to obtain the relic, but for now, there are no leads and no sign of where he may have gone. You leave Monte Carlo, licking your wounds and wondering if you will have the fortune, or misfortune, of running into Abarran and the Wellspring again one day."
msgstr "不管怎麼樣，能從那些可怕的生物跟賭場人員手中逃出生天，已經是一場勝利了。雖然這場命運多舛的劫案原本的目標——時運泉源從你的指縫間溜走了。接下來幾天，你考慮著自己是否有足夠的勇氣——或瘋狂，來再度嘗試。但賭場的大門保持緊閉，從未再打開過，也沒有阿巴蘭跟時運之子的消息。報紙也出奇的沉默，沒有任何關於當天晚上的報導，沒有提到那些造成賭客們驚恐萬分的怪物。看來真的有些人在協助阿巴蘭並掩蓋他的所作所為，防止真相被揭露。更重要的是，由於你的介入，還有奇怪的異次元干擾，阿巴蘭似乎不得不將泉源轉移，離開這裡。你也許可以追蹤他，並找到其他方式取得那個遺物。但眼下無線索可循，你無法得知他去了哪裡。你離開蒙特卡羅，照料自己的傷口，想著也許有一天你會幸運的——或不幸的，再度遇上阿巴蘭跟泉源。"

msgid "When you come to consciousness some me later, you are struck first by the absolute quiet. As you rise to your feet, the casino is completely empty. No cultists. No monsters. No patrons. Not a single soul to be seen. And it doesn't take much to realize that the relic you sought is long gone too. You stumble out into the daylight to find the city going about its business, as if nothing untoward had taken place. In the days that follow, the casino closes its doors for good. There is no further sign of Abarran or the Fortune's Chosen. You leave Monte Carlo, nursing your wounds and wondering if you will have the fortune, or misfortune, of running into Abarran and the Wellspring again one day."
msgstr "當你恢復意識時，全然的寂靜像當頭棒喝般襲來。你站起身，發現賭場已經一片空蕩，沒有邪教徒、沒有怪物，也沒有賭客，沒有任何有生命的東西還留在這。你很快也發現你追尋的遺物也消失了。你步履蹣跚的踏進陽光中，發現城市依然照常運轉著，就像什麼事都沒發生過一樣。接下來幾天，賭場大門深鎖，似乎已永久停業，也沒有任何阿巴蘭跟時運之子的蹤跡。你離開蒙特卡羅，照料自己的傷口，想著也許有一天你會幸運的——或不幸的，再度遇上阿巴蘭跟泉源。"
