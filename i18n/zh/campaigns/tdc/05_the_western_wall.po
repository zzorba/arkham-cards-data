msgid "It becomes increasingly clear as you proceed westward that the beach you are walking along is the top of an ancient ring wall. Fathoms below, the wall forms a sheer drop to a round plaza on the ocean floor. With some planning, you could descend safely to the ocean floor by moving from pocket to pocket of trapped air in the old ruins. If you’re careful, you may just be able to reach the sea floor alive."

msgid "The unsteady foundations of the ancient city shudder as R’lyeh continues to rise. Collapsing layers of crumbling masonry and exposed hallways form a treacherous path up to the surface.

Knowing the dangers of pressure sickness, you can’t simply float to the top. If you’re careful, you may just be able to reach the surface alive."

Pushing aside questions of how he got here, you approach and take his pulse. He is still alive, though heavily wounded. Yellow pus oozes from round sucker marks on his neck, arms, and chest. You bandage his wounds as best you can, then wake him with some smelling salts. His eyes flutter open and he rasps one word: \"Mother.\" You look to the others. This man clearly needs help."

msgid "The man's condition swiftly deteriorates. By the end of your dangerous trek, he is coughing up rancid yellow phlegm. Just as you clear the treacherous paths, he doubles over with a scream and claws at his chest and face. Small holes appear in the skin around his neck and shoulder, then split open like rotten fruit as a torrent of wriggling worm-like parasites pour out. Each worm's mouth is filled with small serrated teeth that drip the same vile yellow bile issuing from the victim's body. Whatever remained of the man slowly rises to stand, like a vile puppet, to stretch one gory hand out toward you. A rubbery worm slithers out of his arm and trembles, as if tasting the air."

The creatures that live in and around R’lyeh’s foundation are warped and strange; you have a feeling you will be seeing them again soon, in your own nightmares."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ocean floor is a dreamlike phantasmagoria of sinister flora and nightmarish creatures. A mutated lanternfish that could only be described as antediluvian swims placidly through a forest of deep water seagrass. Another deep sea creature with glowing eyes and a jagged maw swims straight at you, but turns away at the last moment from the shimmering field that keeps the water at bay."

msgid "A tremor shakes the ancient city, knocking you down. Ruby curses as you steady yourself on a fallen pillar. The city of R’lyeh continues to rise. Eventually, the tremors subside. Ruby stands next to you and looks out at the perfect circle of the black water bay. “Damn,” she says. “I made a bet with Andy we’d get back first. But that softie wouldn’t dare collect if I pretend I broke my leg, don’t you think?” You sigh and lead the way back to the <i>Cassandra</i>, leaving Ruby to bandage her right calf. It will be good to return."

"An ancient dome shimmers enticingly on the sea floor. As you marvel at the strange sights, a chunk of obsidian loosens and falls from up above onto the seafloor dome. Rather than shatter, the dome ripples, pliant, as the rock falls through with a thunderous crash. Something in the center projects a barrier that repels water, but allows solid things to pass through.\n"
"Whatever strange technology is in the dome, Tillinghast will likely be interested in it. However, you could also proceed into R’lyeh: a round door in the base of the wall, contained under the same shimmering field as the dome, beckons you into the city."
