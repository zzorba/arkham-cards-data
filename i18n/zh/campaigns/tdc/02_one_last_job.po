"You suppress a shiver in the cool spring air as you wait under a flickering street lamp. Tonight is the last night of your employ under Randall Tillinghast, a local curio dealer. The antiquarian's latest shipment from New Orleans has gone missing, and he has tasked you with its recovery. This is just the latest in a string of risky and often illicit \"errands\" for the cunning old man. Tonight's job should pay almost enough to satisfy the rest of your debt to Tillinghast.\n"
"Both of your informants arrive on time. Ruby Standish, infamous jewel thief, approaches with a knowing smirk. The plucky reporter Andy Van Nortwick comes soon after. Tillinghast seems to draw the most eclectic mix of specialists for his \"favors.\"\n"
"Between Ruby and Andy's accounts, you piece together a rough idea of the shipment’s location. \"I tracked it from the warehouse in Southside to a few black market dealers in Rivertown. No luck, I'm afraid,\" Ruby says. Andy takes off his hat and wipes his brow \"I nearly bought it in a firefight downtown. Sounds like the Sheldons and O'Bannions are at it again.\"\n"
"The two gangs are in the midst of another turf war—something about a load of missing hooch. It’s possible the missing shipment was just scooped up with the gangs' actual mark."

"You shiver as a chill wind stirs the air. Ruby smiles rakishly. \"What do you say to a little wager? Double or nothing. The first one to score the shipment gets it all. I hope you're ready to lose,\" she smirks.\n"
"Before you can reply, she has already melted into the shadows."

"You drag yourself, battered and bruised, back to Tillinghast Esoterica and lean heavily on the shop door The stained glass window depicts a pyramid with a cyclopean eye that stares at you with unfeeling affectation. Something about it has always seemed uncanny, unsettling. After a long pause, you steady yourself against the doorframe and enter the shop. Inside, you find Ruby and Andy gathered around Randall's desk, appraising a small green figurine.\n"
"Randall leans forward in his chair and peers at you and the others over steepled fingers. \"Better late than never, I suppose. My suspicions have been confirmed: the relic is genuine. Well done. What if I told you I had an offer too good to refuse?\""

"You return to Tillinghast Esoterica with both the shipment and Ruby Standish. The jewel thief sulkily admits you beat her little wager, and promises you a drink afterward with no mention of the \"double or nothing\" she proposed. A silver bell rings as you step into the familiar musty curio shop. Within moments, Randall has the box open on his desk. Inside it is a small jade green idol wrapped in cloth.\n"
"\"I could not be more impressed,\" Tillinghast says. His eyes glitter as he appraises the green figurine. As you look at the idol, your head swims. Ruby paces the foyer of the shop nervously and addresses your employer sharply \"All right, Tillinghast. We held up our end of the bargain. Where's our cut?\" The shop door rings again as Andy returns. Randall seats himself behind his desk and peers at you and the others over steepled fingers. \"My suspicions have been confirmed: the relic is genuine. Well done. What if I told you I had an offer too good to refuse?\""
