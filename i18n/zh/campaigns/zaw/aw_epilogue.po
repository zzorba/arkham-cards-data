"You scour the newspapers in the days you are confined to the hospital bed for recovery.  Throughout all of them, you can't find any mention of the catastrophic events that nearly consumed Arkham.  You had hoped to preserve the city as much as possible, but it's almost insulting how little remains to prove your mission's success.  The possibility of it all being an invention of your own mind occurs, but you have no time to consider before the nurse returns to your bedside.  \"Excuse me, but if you're feeling well enough, a visitor is here to see you.\"  You sit up in bed with a surge of excitement as Alice enters your room with a small smile.  You both wait for the nurse to give you some privacy before she clasps your hand tightly.\n"
"\"You've done it!\" Alice breathes, trying not to shout with joy.  The relief on her face is plain to see, and she looks far better than she did when you first saw her on the train and in the aslyum.  \"I truly can't thank you enough, especially as the evidence of all your struggles has all been returned to Wonderland.  You've done me - and the world at large - an incredible service.\"  You assure Alice that most of your adventures seem to escape the public's eye, but you would have done it all again in spite of the risks.  Alice settles down onto your bedside, and for a brief moment, her smile dips with sadness.  You ask Alice how she's been holding up amid all this, as the key piece of Gurathnaka's plot.\n"
"\"I don't quite know yet,\" she replies with a far-off look in her eye, \"I may never be the same again after all that happened, and this may not yet be the end.  I know that the shadows aren't gone for good.  I can still feel them grasping at the edges of my dreams.\"  Alice looks back to you gratefully and her smile returns.  \"But for the first time in over a decade, I can sleep without fear.  Both for myself and for the world around me.\"  You think back on your journey through Wonderland, and you ask Alice about what has befallen her strange dreams."

"你在被關在病床上靜養的期間翻遍了報紙，然而卻找不到任何報導提到這場幾乎吞噬阿卡姆的毀滅事件。你曾如此盡心盡力地保護這座城市，但幾乎沒有對你任務成功的證明，簡直就像是侮辱。你內心不由得冒出整場冒險都只是你的幻想的念頭，但你還來不及細想，一名護士就回到了你的床邊。“打擾了，如果你的身體狀況還可以，有一位訪客想見你。”當你看到愛麗絲帶著微笑走進病房時，你興奮的從床上坐起來。你們等到護士離開，然後她緊緊握著你的手。\n"
"“你做到了！”愛麗絲說道，忍耐著不要高興地叫出來。她的神情明顯看起來如釋重負，而且她看起來遠比你初次在火車上和在精神病院裡看到她時好很多。“再怎麼感謝你都不夠，尤其是那些你努力的證據都回到了仙境，你為我——以及整個世界——幫了一個莫大的忙。”你向愛麗絲保證說大眾似乎都沒有察覺你們的這些冒險，而且要是重來，儘管如此危險，但你還是會再做一次。愛麗絲在你的床邊坐了下來，有那麼一瞬間，她的笑容裡帶著悲傷。你問愛麗絲，身為古拉斯納卡陰謀的關鍵，她是如何從這一切中堅持下來的。\n"
"“我也還不太清楚。”她像是看著遠方回答道，“在這一切發生之後，我也許再也回不去從前了，而且這一切可能還沒結束，我知道那些暗影沒有從此消失，我仍然能感覺到他們正抓著我的夢境邊緣。”愛麗絲轉頭感激地望著你，她的笑容又回來了。“但是這十幾年以來第一次，無論是為了我自己，還是為了我身處的這個世界，我終於能夠毫無恐懼地入睡了。”你回想起在仙境中的旅程，詢問愛麗絲她奇怪的夢境裡產生了什麼變化。"

The shadows were already trying to devour it, and it may not have lasted on its own otherwise.\"  She looks to you encouragingly.  \"But if your memories of Arkham helped to save it, then there may yet be hope for Wonderland.\""
msgstr "“仙境幾乎消失了。”愛麗絲嘆道，“但不要為此責備自己。你做了你必須做的以確保這個世界能夠存續。暗影已在試圖吞噬它，若是你不這麼做，這個世界可能沒法靠自己支撐下去。”她鼓勵地看著你。“但如果你用你對阿卡姆的記憶拯救了它，那麼仙境可能還有希望。”"

msgstr "“仙境嚴重地受到了陰影摧殘的影響，”愛麗絲說道，“但它比我最初想的還要更堅韌。經歷過這幾年的混亂，它仍抵抗住沒有完全被侵蝕。”她看著窗外，嘆了口氣。“我只希望他們還能繼續撐住。”"

You soon discover that your audience has doubled, as the ethereal grin of the Cheshire Cat appears above Alice's shoulder, and its head materializes from time to time, listening as eagerly as Alice herself.  The minutes pass until finally, the nurse intrudes once more.  \"I'm afraid that visiting hours have ended,\" she says cheerfully before ducking out to pass the same message onto other rooms.  Alice rises with a final clasp of your hands, resolution clear on her face.  \"I've decided,\" she states plainly, \"I'm going to remain here in Arkham.\"  You raise your eyebrow in surprise.  Few people who know the mysteries and horrors of this town live to recount them, and fewer still willingly face more.  \"I've learned from several others in the city here that Arkham has many mysteries of its own.  If I can help to solve even one of them, then perhaps I can begin to repay you for your kindness and bravery.\""

"Hope you're all still sane!  And even if you're not, I hope you enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland campaign.  It's always been one of those stories that mixes whimsy and unease in just the right amounts, and it makes no secrets about madness.  The Alice stories have had darker interpretations in the past, from American McGee to Tim Burton, but each had their own stories that they wanted to tell.  My goal for this campaign was to stay as true to the books as I could while making it an adventure worthy of the Arkham Horror investigators.  I didn't want to just change Wonderland's madness; I wanted to add it to Lovecraftian madness instead.\n"
"I created the bulk of this campaign while the official Dream-Eaters campaign was still being released, and I intentionally avoided reading into it until I had the basics for the Wonderland gameplay set.  If there were going to be two campaigns about dream journeys and irritating cats, then I wanted to make sure that this one wasn't being a copycat.\n"
"There were three main challenges in creating the campaign.  First, I wanted to include everything from the Alice books that I possibly could, and to stay as true to those characters as I could.  The stories have an expansive cast, and everyone has their favorites, and I hopefully succeeded in doing each of them justice.  Some unrelated characters and stories had to be combined for the sake of individual scenarios, but in a sense, it was the only way to fit everything in.  In another sense, it helped with the second challenge: making the middle six scenarios scale properly from either side.  The interludes allowed me to give a spotlight to some characters that didn't fit into the scenarios while ramping up the difficulty both ways.\n"
"The third challenge was making Alice herself both relevant and central to the story without making her more important than the investigators, in a sense.  In my mind, she was important enough to be more than just an ally, so she became a full investigator, but only for the final scenario.  By including her fragments in each scenario and her indirect assistance in the interludes, it gave the players that she was accompanying them in spirit, and made her involvement in the final scenario a little more personal.\n"
"As a side note for the mythos involvement, I chose Gurathnaka specifically because there was little information other than that it was a shadowy eater of dreams.  This gave me plenty of room to improvise with the story.  Gurathnaka was created by Matthew Grau for the futuristic CthulhuTech setting, but future mythos must have been past mythos as well.  An ancient one's ambition to eat more than just dreams made the perfect catalyst for the campaign.\n"
"Thanks again for playing!"

"希望你們都還能保持理智！無論如何，我希望你能享受愛麗絲詭境夢遊的劇本。愛麗絲的故事一直以來就是那些能恰到好處地混合奇思妙想和不安元素的故事之一，它對瘋狂毫不掩飾。過去，從亞美利堅·麥基到提姆·伯頓，對愛麗絲故事的詮釋較為黑暗，但每個人都有自己想講述的故事。我對這個劇本的目標是盡可能忠實於書本，並同時讓它成為值得調查員進行的一場冒險。我不想只是改變仙境裡的瘋狂；我想把它加入洛夫克拉夫特式的瘋狂之中。\n"
"我在官方的食夢者劇本仍在發佈中的時候構思了這個劇本的大部分內容，並且在完成這個劇本基本的遊戲設定之前，我刻意地避免閱讀官方劇本。如果兩個劇本都與夢境的旅程和惱人的貓有關，那麼我保證這些只是巧合。\n"
"劇本的設計有三個主要的挑戰。首先，我想盡可能地囊括愛麗絲書中的所有內容，並儘可能忠實於這些角色。愛麗絲的故事有許多不同的角色，每個人都有自己的最愛，我希望能成功地讓每個人都受到公平的對待。為了形成單一的冒險，一些不相關的角色和故事必須被放在一起，但從某種意義上說，這是將一切都融合在一起的唯一方法。另一方面，這也有助於解決第二個挑戰：讓中間的六場冒險無論從任何一邊進行都有適當的難度。幕間故事讓我能夠聚焦在一些不適合放在冒險裡的角色，同時從兩個方向都能逐步地增加難度。\n"
"第三個挑戰是讓愛麗絲本身既與故事相關又能成為故事的中心，但某方面又不能讓她比調查員更加重要。在我心中，她的重要性不僅只作為一個盟友，所以她成為了一位完整的調查員，但僅限於最後一場冒險。通過在每場冒險中蒐集她的碎片以及她在幕間故事中的間接幫助，讓玩家們有了她在精神上陪伴他們的感覺，也讓她在最終冒險的參與更加個人化。\n"
"作為旁註，在導入神話時，我特別選擇了古拉斯納卡，因為除了身為一個暗影食夢者之外，它幾乎沒有什麼其他資訊。這給了我足夠的空間來創作這個故事。古拉斯納卡是Matthew Grau為未來主義的克蘇魯科技設定而創造的，但未來的神話必然也一定是過去的神話。古神的野心不僅僅是吞噬夢境，正好能完美地成為這場劇本的催化劑。\n"
"再次感謝你的遊玩！"
