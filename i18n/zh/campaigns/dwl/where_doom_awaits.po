"You awaken to the sound of screeching. Fearing the worst, you grab your equipment and head out into the streets of Dunwich. As soon as you step outside, you sense a foulness in the cold night air: an awful, pungent smell that can scarcely be described and a heaviness to the atmosphere that makes it difficult to breathe. The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below.\n"
"Flocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you, watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck. As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature — <b>Yog‐Sothoth</b>. Failing to stop this ritual may spell doom…not only Dunwich, but for the entire world."

"一陣尖叫聲把你驚醒。你心中有種不祥的預感，便立刻下床拿好裝備，走出了房屋。敦威治街道的空氣異常冰冷，一股刺激性的氣味快要讓你無法喘息，除此之外，還有一種不可言喻的壓抑感。敦威治的村民都把門關得死死的，村莊如同墓地一般。在遠處的山頂，一抹微弱的光芒壟罩著村莊上空。阿米蒂奇和西布倫都提到過這個地方，叫做哨兵山。幾個月前那場臭名昭著的儀式，就在這裡發生。那光如同呼吸一般一明一暗，把夜空照亮至如同白晝。\n"
"夜鷹在村莊的屋頂聚集，注視著你的一舉一動。你借用了西布倫那輛老掉牙的貨車，向哨兵山進發。尖叫聲越來越強烈，令你產生強烈的耳鳴。現在，所有關於敦威治的線索都指向了這個地方。如果賽斯所要舉行的邪穢儀式與阿米蒂奇一行人在數月之前所阻止之事有關，那這項儀式就涉及一個古老的存在——<b>猶格·索托斯</b>。如果你無法阻止這場儀式，那麼毀滅就將降臨在這片大地上，不單單是敦威治，全世界都將成為古神的玩物……"

"The path leading up Sentinel Hill is narrow and too torn up for Zebulon’s truck, so you park at the base of the hill and prepare to make the rest of the trip on foot. Just then, you notice that you are not alone. Several men and women emerge from the woods behind you, brandishing firearms and lining you up in their sights. You raise your hands and brace for the worst. “Wait,” one of them says, raising his hand to the others. “I recognize you from the Clover Club.” He grins toothily and lowers his weapon. “Naomi sends her regards.”\n"
"Curious, you ask what the gangsters are doing here. “Ms. O’Bannion had us investigate the attack on her fiancé’s club,” he explains. “Turns out there were some men in Arkham behind the whole thing. Some Bishop fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before he can explain further, the all-too-familiar ratta‐tat of a tommy gun echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny. Come on, boys!” He beckons to the others to follow and runs up the hill. Shaking your head, you do the same. These mobsters don’t know what they’re getting into."

"山間的小道太過狹窄，西布倫的貨車無法開上去。你只好下車徒步上山。沒走兩步，你發現自己被人跟蹤了，一些持槍的黑衣男女正跟在你身後。你轉頭一看，他們已經舉槍瞄準了你，你趕緊舉起雙手，以免事態惡化。“請等等，”有一個男人向其他人揮手示意。“我們是四葉草俱樂部派來的人。”他淺淺地笑了一下。“娜奧米讓我們來向你致意。”\n"
"你好奇地詢問黑幫為什麼會在這兒。“歐巴尼恩女士命令我們調查她未婚夫俱樂部的襲擊事件。”他解釋道，“看來這起事件背後是幾個阿卡姆的人，是個叫畢曉普的傢伙和他的同黨。我們追蹤他們到此處。”他話還沒說完，山上就傳來了機關槍掃射的聲音。“文尼這傢伙，總是這麼急性子，大家快跟上！”他指揮其他成員趕緊上山。你無奈地搖了搖頭，跟了上去，這些人看來完全不知道自己面對的是什麼。"
