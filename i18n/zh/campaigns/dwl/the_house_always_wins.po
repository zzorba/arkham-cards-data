"Dr. Armitage suggested you track down his associate Dr. Francis Morgan. He’s not sure whether Dr. Morgan is in trouble, but he’s not particularly happy with his colleague’s present choice of company. He’s in the Clover Club, a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club’s exact location isn’t easy—you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the Downtown restaurants operates as the club’s front. That restaurant is La Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the theatre. You change into your Sunday best and make your way there.\n"
"In front of La Bella Luna stands a man in a pinstripe suit who sizes you up as you approach. “Enjoy yourselves,” he says with a snake-like grin as he holds open the restaurant’s front door."

"阿米蒂奇博士建議你去找摩爾根尋求幫助。他並不知道摩爾根現在的情況，但是他對摩爾根最近的作為很不滿意。摩爾根現在正在四葉草俱樂部，那是一個商業街上的地下賭場。要找到這個地方可不容易，你花了一點點小錢，才讓幾個餐館服務員乖乖開口。你找到了劇院附近的“月下美人”義大利餐館，當然這只是個掩飾，更深處藏著的，是銅臭味的秘密。\n"
"在月下美人餐館門口，一個穿著白色條紋西裝的男人，正打量著你。“好好享受吧。”他為你們打開了餐館的門，臉上浮現出一絲奸詐的笑容。"

msgstr "你勉強活著離開了俱樂部。"

msgid "You flee to the end of the block and pause to recover. Before you can catch your breath, the ground shakes with a thunderous crash. People emerge from their homes and storefronts to see what the ruckus is, and a crowd forms on the street. You head to the front of the crowd and are horrified to see the building from which you fled just minutes earlier reduced to rubble. There is no sign of Dr. Morgan anywhere."
msgstr "你飛一樣地逃出了餐館，直到離開這個街區。你停下大口喘著氣，突然間，地面輕微晃動起來，人們從家中湧出，來到大街上看到底發生了什麼。你推開人群衝到最前面，幾分鐘前你剛逃出來的月下美人，已經變成了一堆廢墟。連同摩爾根博士一起，在這個世界上消失了。"

msgid "“What in the world…?” Dr. Morgan finally breaks out of his daze as you make your way to safety. You ask him what he remembers, and he sputters and shakes his head. “It’s all a haze,” he explains, visibly exhausted. “I was having the run of my life! Perhaps I had one too many shots. But, those creatures—I haven’t seen anything like that since…” He trails off, and you can tell that his mind is racing. His eyes widen with realization and his face pales. “I may not be in the best shape, but I’ll help with your investigation. Whatever it takes.”"
msgstr "“我到底怎麼了……”你們在逃跑時，摩爾根博士終於清醒過來。你詢問他還記得什麼，他迷茫地搖了搖頭。“一切都迷迷糊糊的，我那時連贏了好幾把，可能一下興奮就喝多了。但是，這個怪物。我從未見過那樣的生物……”他的聲音因為疲勞而變輕，你能看得出來，他正在飛速思考著。突然，他瞪大了眼睛，臉色也變得蒼白。“我可能現在狀況不太好，但我會不惜一切代價協助你們的調查。”"

"Although you were unable to find Dr. Morgan in the club, the man you rescued is grateful for your help. He introduces himself as Peter Clover, the owner of the establishment you’d just left. Despite the situation, he maintains an air of quiet professionalism. As you make your way towards the street, a well-polished Chrysler B-70 rolls up to you, and a gorgeous woman with long brown hair and narrow eyes exits. She is flanked by dangerous-looking men who slip their hands under their suit jackets when they see you. “Peter,” she says with a sigh of relief, “Good, you’re okay. I heard there was trouble?” She turns and glares at you with deadly eyes. “Who are they?”\n"
"Mr. Clover dusts off his vest, unworried. “Naomi, my dear, these are friends of mine. They…” he clears his throat. “They escorted me off the premises,” he explains after a short pause. “They have earned our gratitude.” The woman crosses her arms and takes a moment to size you up before giving you a smirk.\n"
"“Very well then. I must thank you for taking care of Peter. Run along now; we’ll handle things from here.” She nods to the goons flanking her and they walk past you toward the club’s rear entrance, pulling firearms out from underneath their coats. You’re not sure what ‘handling things’ means, but you’re pretty sure you don’t want to be here when the gunfire starts. You thank Naomi and Peter, and head off."

"雖然你無法找到摩爾根博士，但你們救出的那個男人，十分感激你們的友善。他名叫彼得·克勞佛，是四葉草俱樂部所在大樓的主人。儘管發生了這種災難，他還是保持著專業的冷靜頭腦。你們向著街道走去，一輛B-70克萊斯勒高級轎車停在你們面前，從裡面走出一位留著褐色長髮，眼眸細長的美麗女士。她身後跟著一個目光兇惡，身著黑色西服的大漢。“彼得，”那女子看到你們時，好像鬆了一口氣。“你沒事真是太好了。我聽說你遇到麻煩了？”她轉頭看了看你們，“這些人是誰？”\n"
"克勞佛拍了拍肩上的灰塵，一臉輕鬆。“娜奧米，親愛的，這些是我的朋友。他們……”他清了清喉嚨。“他們護送我離開了房子，”他停頓了一下，簡短地解釋道。“我很感激他們。”那個女人叉起雙手放在胸前，仔細地打量著你們，然後是一個很明顯的假笑。\n"
"“那好吧。我謝謝你們照顧彼得。你們可以走了，剩下的事交給我們處理。”她向那個壯漢點了點頭，然後從後門走進了俱樂部，一邊從大衣下拿出了槍。你不太清楚他們會怎麼“處理”，不過你也不想知道具體方案。你們謝別了娜奧米和彼得，離開了這兒。"

msgid "You are pulled from the debris by several firefighters, one of whom exclaims, “We’ve got a live one!” A few of them patch you up, and the cops ask you what happened. You’re certain they wouldn’t believe your story about horrible monstrosities demolishing the building from within. Unsure of what to say, you give a vague statement about not remembering much. “We’re bringing you to St. Mary’s,” one of the nurses says, pointing to a nearby ambulance. Knowing now how dire the situation is, you slip away while she is distracted by something else in the rubble…"
msgstr "你被消防員從廢墟中拉了出來，“這兒還有人活著！”然後你感到自己被人抱了起來，放在擔架上，有警察來盤問你發生了什麼。你很清楚，他們不會相信你的故事，那個建築裡的怪物若非親眼所見，有誰會信呢？你一下感到語塞，憋了半天，勉強講了一些話作為塘塞。“我們會把你帶回聖瑪莉醫院的，”一名護士把你送上了救護車。你感到事態已經開始變得複雜，於是趁著護士不注意，你偷偷地溜走了……"
