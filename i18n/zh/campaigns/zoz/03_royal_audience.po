"The brief standoff with the green soldier is interrupted as a portly man rushes toward the crash site from one of the city gates.  \"Omby, get these people on their feet at once!  Queen Ozma has commanded us to bring the intruders to her without any delay!\"  The soldier nods and motions for you to stand, though you hardly need encouragement.  A civilization this rich might be able to lend some assistance in containing the Colour, provided they aren't as fickle as the plant people you first encountered.\n"
"The portly man -- the guardian of the gates, as he calls himself -- leads you through the pristine streets of the emerald city.  Its citizens, all as richly dressed as nobility, observe you with some curiosity, but seem largely unconcerned.  The procession wends its way to an opulent palace in the center of the city.  The gateman and soldier take a brief moment to adjust their disheveled appearances before leading you proudly inside.\n"
"\"Your majesty, the intruders!\"  The two shepherd you forward into a grand audience chamber.  A young girl in regal attire sits at the center in an emerald throne, looking serenely out at you.  Beside and around her stand eclectic figures that surprise you to say the least.  A scarecrow, a man made of tin, another man made of brass, a gangly figure with a pumpkin for a head, each one looking at you as though you were the odd ones out instead.\n"
"\"Approach, strangers,\" Queen Ozma commands in a pleasant tone.  A small bald man next to her gives an amused chuckle at the sight of you.  \"Well well, more people from outside Oz?  I didn't think it possible with the anti-aircraft spell I put up over the country.\" Another woman -- tall and graceful with long red hair -- nods in agreement.  \"More than that, Oz should be entirely separated from their world.  Could this be related to the strange meteor?\"\n"
"You step forward as ordered, telling the queen and her court that you know all about the meteor, and that you intend to stop its evils.  The throne room falls silent as you relate the first visit of the Colour to the Gardner farm outside Arkham.  Their faces fall, and some utter words of horror as you describe the gruesome events.  Queen Ozma bites her thumb as worry washes over her.  \"The citizens of Oz cannot be killed, but this transformation is something far worse than death.  I cannot stand by while this... Colour threatens the safety of Oz.\"  Her court murmurs in agreement as she stands to address them.  \"As they know the capabilities of the living Colour, these visitors will lead us in expelling it from Oz.\"\n"
"\"And the rest of the world too!\" the bald man chimes in.\n"
"As the court mobilizes, a young girl in a simple gingham dress enters, accompanied by two other girls and a little black dog.  \"Oh, hello!\" she calls out, approaching you with great interest.  \"I didn't know folks from outside Oz could still get in.  My name's Dorothy, and I came here from Kansas.  Where're you folks from?\""

msgid "Dorothy takes especial notice of you, as another girl her own age.  You give her a quiet greeting, but nothing more.  After the difficult life you've led, it's hard to accept this fairy tale land at face value.  It reminds you so much of the stories from the book that gave you comfort at the orphanage.  Dorothy notices your conflicted expression and smiles encouragingly.  \"You know, the Good Witch of the North looks out over girls like us.  Keeps us safe from harm.  No matter what dangers may happen, she'll protect you!\""

All animals in Oz can talk, even ones that weren't born here.  Toto is from Kansas like me, and though he don't like to speak much, he can talk just as well as anybody.\""

"\"...well I reckon it is,\" a soft smoky voice suddenly responds.  Duke looks just as surprised as you are, but his tail begins to wag rapidly.  For the first time, you're able to have a real conversation with your faithful companion.  The very idea is already giving you confidence that you didn't know you had."

With such a great threat at hand, I will not hinder our chances of protecting the people.\""

And an American by extraction, I should mention.\"  The Wizard recounts a bit of his history, from his early days as a carnival hawker to ruler of Oz, until he finally settled down as Ozma's court sorcerer.  He's aware of Arkham and the other ghoulish regions of New England, but had never visited.  \"The magic you know is probably a shade more sinister than my own, but with the same foundation.  Magical tools and ingredients in the right amounts, with the right incantations.  I've got everything and anything an aspiring witch or wizard needs in my bag here.\"  He pats the handbag proudly as he shows it off."

msgid "The other figure still near Ozma's throne is the odd scarecrow from earlier.  He stands facing away from the crowd, his arms folded and posture suggesting deep thinking.  He turns toward you before you can decide whether or not to interrupt.  \"This problem has been quite a challenge for my excellent brains!\" the Scarecrow exclaims jovially, \"I am the Scarecrow, and it's a pleasure to meet you.  It's just a shame about the circumstances.  The Wizard gave me such good brains, but I still can't reason how a colour on its own can be a thing.  A living thing, for that matter!\"  You ask how a scarecrow can be a living thing either, and he chuckles softly.  \"I've thought of that often, but I never could find an answer.  I just happened to be one day.  Say, I wonder if the same is true for this Colour?  In any case, it will take plenty of thinking to stop it from harming anything.  If you need any ideas, you can rely on my brains!\""

They were both among Dorothy's first companions, and after the fall of the Wicked Witch of the West, her former slaves invited the Tin Woodman to stay as their new ruler.  \"The Wizard gave me a noble heart that has served me well.  It has made me the man I am today -- well, actually that would be Ku-Klip the tinsmith, but that is a story for another time.  Right now, it is my duty to help protect you from trouble in our journey to expel the Colour.  May I entrust my oil can to you?  If I weep too much from destroying our enemies, I might rust myself stiff!\""

msgid "Dorothy leads you and your new acquaintances back out into the palace to meet the others.  At the entrance to the throne room, the squat brass man stands at attention.  He tips his hat -- more like a brodie helmet due to his metal wardrobe -- with stiff motions as you approach.  \"Good eve-ning.  I am Tik-Tok the ma-chine man, cre-at-ed by Smith and Tin-ker.  I un-der-stand that you wish to help us.\"  His stilted way of speaking is a bit jarring, but the whirring gears inside his body show that even his speech is a mechanical process.  Tik-Tok turns to show you three ports and a winding key on his back.  \"You will find me a val-u-a-ble al-ly, if you can keep me ful-ly wound up.

He waves to you ungracefully, and Ozma beckons you over.  \"I would like to introduce you to Jack Pumpkinhead.  He is a creation of mine from before I was queen of Oz, made with the Powder of Life.\"  Jack nods his enormous head with a rattling of seeds and looks to you.  \"Queen Ozma is my father.  The best one I've ever known.\"  Ozma smiles knowingly, exhaling but not quite laughing.  \"Jack may not be a tremendous scholar, but his perspective on things is refreshing.\"  Jack knocks on the hard rind of his pumpkin head.  \"This head is filled with many excellent seeds.  It may be one of my smartest ones yet!  I shall do my best to help you in any way I can think of.\""

msgid "A colorful figure catches your eye as she works towards you in acrobatic ways.  She looks like a human-sized doll, dressed in -- and made from -- many patches of different cloth scraps.  You hear a crunkle of straw behind you and see that the Scarecrow is straightening his appearance with a smile on his face at the girl's approach.  \"That is Ms. Scraps, though many know her as the Patchwork Girl instead,\" he informs you.  The doll-like woman stops her cartwheeling in front of you and tilts her head to one side as she looks you over.  After a few moments she lets out a loud laugh and circles around you for other angles.  \"I've never seen someone as strange as you!  Though it's strange in a strange way.  It's definitely not an Oz kind of strange.\"  The Patchwork Girl returns to idly spinning as Dorothy shakes her head with a sigh.  \"Ms. Scraps can be real forward, but she don't mean any offense.  She just has a different outlook than most other folks.  Dr. Pipt made her with the Powder of Life too, though he ain't a sorcerer anymore.\"  The stuffed girl stops spinning again with a smile.  \"Traveling with you ought to be some fun.  I can do what I like, and that Colour may be even stranger than you!\""

Not since the incidents with Ugu the Shoemaker or Queen Coo-ee-oh has it been necessary to call so many capable hands together.\"  You give him a polite bow and he bows in return with much more pomp.  \"You may call me the Frogman.  It is natural, for I am as much a frog as I am a man.  Though I have gained much wisdom since I bathed in the Truth Pond.  Its waters made me unable to tell a lie, and forced me to recognize what I do and do not know.  The Colour which you spoke of is one such thing that I do not know of.  For the sake of Oz, and to expand my own wisdom, I will assist you gladly.\""

Standing beside the main path are two men -- regular humans, in contrast to the strange cast you'd met so far.  One of them -- a red-haired sailor -- raises his hand in greeting as you approach.  \"Shags and I have been talking about you and the Colour for some time now.  I can tell that you've seen your fair share of misfortune in life, though you're not alone in that.\"  He turns, showing off his wooden left leg to you.  \"Folks call me Cap'n Bill.  I'm a California man, though I've sailed the world and have some idea of the evils you've fought.\"  His expression remains stoic as he sorts through his thoughts.  \"Luck favors the prepared.  It's an old saying that I've stood by in life.  If there's anything you might need, I'll be on hand to help you get it.\""

He wears a suit that somehow looks old and tattered, but at the same time richly tailored.  \"Shaggy Man is what most people call me.  I've wandered America and a few other places too, and seen the same kind of dangers that you and ol' Bill have.\"  His brow knits in worry and he looks to you with clear conviction.  \"Wanderin' was good enough for me until I found my way to Oz.  I'll do anything to keep it from falling to ruin, and I think you'll find me a man of many talents.  Why I've got tricks that would astound even an invader from space!\"  He gives a hoarse laugh, but it quickly trails off as the gravity of the situation sets back in.  \"Our only silver lining is you folks here to help us.  Without you, we wouldn't know the first thing about the Colour.  Might have even ignored it until it was too late.  You've already earned my respect -- all of our respects -- for agreeing to help us here.\""

You try to remain calm as Dorothy doesn't look the least bit worried as she walks up to hug the lion.  \"Lion, wake up!  We got important work to do.\"  The lion yawns lazily and opens one eye, then both as his sight settles on you.  Dorothy sums up the situation as the lion rouses himself, looking rather worried the whole time.  \"I'll help because you asked me, Dorothy, but I think it only fair to warn these visitors that I am a cowardly lion.  I may be king of the beasts, but I am dreadfully afraid of this evil.\"  Dorothy shakes her head and strokes the lion's mane.  \"But you've saved us from danger so many times!\"  The lion gives a worried mutter, but closes his eyes from the petting.  \"Even so, I was afraid each time.\""

If only Oz was being invaded by an army of fat babies.  Then I could gobble them all up.\"  Dorothy pats the tiger reassuringly.  \"You couldn't eat a fat baby even if you wanted to.\"  The tiger nods again sullenly as he settles back down.  \"That is true.  My conscience wouldn't allow me to.\"  You're glad that you don't have to put the tiger's willpower to the test, but the creature certainly knows how to be intimidating."

His wooden feet are shod with gold and he wears a saddle stamped with the royal crest of Oz.  \"Hello, friend Dorothy,\" he says in a scratchy voice, \"do you need to travel somewhere?\"  Dorothy scratches his wooden muzzle as she leads him over to you.  \"We do, Sawhorse.  There's some big trouble that our new friends here told us about, and you can help us travel better than anyone.\"  The Sawhorse looks to you with his wooden knot eyes with some indifference.  \"Hello.  If Dorothy says you are friends, then you are friends.\"  The young girl leads the Sawhorse back around toward the front of the palace.  \"He may be knobby, but there's no faster thing in Oz.  He was brought to life by the same powder that Ozma used on Jack, only instead of brains, the Sawhorse got speed.\"  You hope that such a bumpy-looking ride won't be necessary, but there's no telling what dangers the Colour may present."
