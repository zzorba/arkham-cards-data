"You have barely begun the return trip when a sudden magical glow surrounds you.  Its color is familiar, giving you no reason to panic, but the rocky scenery suddenly transforms.  You are once again in the throne room of Queen Ozma, with both she and Glinda looking anxiously at you.  The screams of citizens and rumble of stone roar dully from outside, and you rush to the upper floors of the palace to take rapid stock.\n"
"The Emerald City is in utter chaos as buildings shake and unearthly hues flash at the city walls.  Large arcs of protoplasmic mass rise up and collide into city's defenses -- both physical and magical -- steadily wearing away both of them.  Beyond, you at last see the Colour in a single, concentrated mass.  It roils like boiling tar, unpredictable and lethal, its unearthly glow bathing the withered landscape in the same maddening shade."

msgid "The surges of Colour lash towards the city wildly, striking viciously but with surprising focus.  Ruggedo -- still barely recovered from the possession -- clutches his temples and stamps his feet in painful resistance.  \"I can feel the poisoned Earth all around us...\" he hisses, \"The Colour is straining... hurrying...\" The Nome struggles to remain conscious as palace servants summoned by Ozma carry him away to rest.  You brace yourself to face the fury of the Colour -- if it is even capable of any such emotion at all.  If the Emerald City falls, the world falls."

msgid "When the game begins, place 1 doom on the agenda. <i>(This doom triggers the forced effect on the agenda.)</i>"

msgid "The Colour's attacks are powerful, but surprisingly pensive.  It recognizes you and the rest of Oz as threats, but you have only fought its symptoms at the surface, and did not succeed against it in the Nome Kingdom.  Regardless, time is of the essence.  Any chance of repelling the Colour from Earth lies in defending the Emerald City and striking back against the entity.  Now your fight truly begins."

msgid "the Emerald City lies in ruins."

msgid "the Colour consumed Oz and the world."

msgid "the investigators defended the Emerald City."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Colour's advance cannot be stopped any further.  Surrounded by the encroaching entity, the Emerald City is no longer your last bastion.  It is your mausoleum.  As the Colour washes over you, you feel the burning cold that Ammi Pierce described secondhand... the distortion of your body... the crumbling of your brain... the self you once knew grows alien... and though you know the world will succumb in time... it ceases to matter."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the eerie silence of the Colour's retreat, you take weary pause to appraise the city's state.  With few exceptions, the buildings are collapsed and faded.  Even with the Colour expunged, the gray, cracked destruction in its wake covers much of the city.  Only time will tell if the grand city will ever be the same again, but there is still work to be done.  One final task lies just beyond the warped treeline."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the eerie silence of the Colour's retreat, you take weary pause to appraise the city's state.  The green glint of emeralds still catch your eye intermittently as sun filters through the gray cloud cover.  Against all odds, the Emerald City stands, tarnished perhaps but still proud.  Now all that remains is to secure its future -- and a future for the whole world -- by going on the attack at long last."
msgstr ""

msgid "The surviving citizens of Oz emerge timidly from the least damaged structures, wondering their fears aloud.  Ozma and Glinda do their best to assure the public as you take what brief respite you can.  You will need every bit of your strength and cunning to finish the task ahead, for it will decide whether the Colour meets its match, or if Earth is destined to be as barren and alien as the countries outside the city."
