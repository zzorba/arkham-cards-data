"You have only just checked into your lodge in Anchorage when you receive an unmarked package:\n"
"<typewriter>\tAgents,</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tWe have lost contact with several operatives in central Alaska in recent weeks, likely due to Coterie activity. One operative was looking into a possible lead: a lens with apparent paradimensional capabilities. Enclosed is the journal of prospector Rhett Landry, currently institutionalized at Morningside Sanatorium in Oregon.</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tIf the lens is a Key, acquire it at all costs.</typewriter>\n"
"<right><fancy>~Q. Taylor</fancy></right>\n"
"You spend a full day poring over the prospector’s journal, which is mostly comprised of wildlife sketches and notes on mining. However, the final entry is chilling:\n"
"<blockquote>“<i>October the 4th, 1923:</i>\n"
"<i>Tonight, I bury that accursed lens where I found it.</i>\n"
"<i>I dared not commit my thoughts to the page after finding it, but I have nothing to lose now. While surveying the new branch in the mine, I found a curious lens buried in the rock. It was opaque and emanated a beguiling light. Holding it made me feel special. As if I had been chosen. Looking through it, I saw incredible plants, creatures, people, structures, in a strange otherworldly landscape. A world beyond our own. A world that should exist. A dark reflection of our own: a haven for lost objects, lost memories. The lens—the Sable Glass—is the mirror that shows the truth of this other world.</i>\n"
"<i>How foolish was I to think I could use the lens for my own gain! The more I looked at the other world, the more the other world looked back. By peering into the glass, I must have called something—some awful, nameless creature—through. More and more of my fellow prospectors went missing in the woods and erased from memory. My companions, my possessions, my home: all were swallowed by the strange creature I glimpsed in the Sable Glass. And now when I look through it, I can see them, there, in that other place.</i>\n"
"<i>The creature that stalks the woods is made of nothing, and yet it is many things: constantly shifting, ever-changing. It has the traits of many animals, like a chimera from old myths. I tried to hunt it using the Sable Glass, but looking at it made my head spin. After surveying the area, I set a trap and thought I killed one of its forms: a great lupine thing that howled and dissipated into nothingness. But when I returned to camp the next day, it had struck the camp. My companions have vanished from memory and space.</i>\n"
"<i>The authorities say I should be locked up. My only hope is to set things right, to put the Sable Glass back where I found it. Perhaps then everything will be right again.”</i>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"Next to the journal entry is an array of dark scratches, which you had assumed were nervous scribbles. However, given Landry’s account, you wonder if it isn’t his attempt to sketch the creature. The next day, you launch a search for any record of Mr. Landry’s gold mine, starting with prospecting permissions in Anchorage City Hall and the local library. After a day of fruitless research, you still cannot find an official permit or record of a mine connected to Rhett Landry. As you return to the lodge that evening, you spot a tall, willowy figure with a distinctive red cravat standing next to a packed sledge.\n"
"“Well met,” the figure greets you with a self-satisfied smile. “You must be the troublemakers everyone is talking about. Pleased to make your acquaintance. I’m Thorne.” They extend a confident hand to shake yours. “If you’re here, I can only assume it is for the same reason as I. Keep a weather eye out: it’s supposed to be quite cold near Fairbanks! May the best one win.” Thorne winks at you, then mounts the sled.\n"
"You wonder if Thorne’s reference to Fairbanks was clever misdirection or a friendly hint. After asking around the lodge, an attendant opens up about your rival’s preparations: “I was confused at first, until it became clear they were asking about something in tribal territory. You don’t need a permit to prospect out there.” After some more questioning, you have a good sense of Thorne’s direction and the location of the mine."

"<typewriter>\t探員：</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\t我們近幾週在阿拉斯加中心地帶失去了數個調查員，極可能是出自结社的手筆。其中一名調查員發現了可能的線索：一個明顯具有超次元力量的透鏡。附件是探勘者瑞德·蘭德里的日誌，他正被收容在奧勒岡州的晨邊療養院。</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\t如果透鏡是密鑰，不計一切代價也要獲得。</typewriter>\n"
"<right><fancy>~Q. 泰勒</fancy></right>\n"
"你花了一整天翻閱日誌，大多數都是野生動物的素描跟採礦的註記。但最後一段記載讓你心底發寒：\n"
"<blockquote><i>“1923年10月4號：</i>\n"
"<i>今晚我將被詛咒的透鏡埋回了我找到它的地方。</i>\n"
"<i>剛找到它時我不敢在日誌中做任何記錄，但我現在沒什麼好失去了。我在探勘新礦脈時在岩石中發現了這個透鏡。它無法透光而且本身散發著奇異的微光，拿著它讓我感到很特別，像是被選中了 一樣。我在透鏡裡看見了不可思議的動植物、人類、建築，一個截然不同的世界，一個不屬於我們的世界。這個世界一定存在，它是我們世界的黑暗倒影：一切被遺忘的事物與記憶的避風港。這個透鏡——黑曜透鏡，讓我看見另一個世界的真相。</i>\n"
"<i>我居然以為可以將它納為己用，我真是太愚蠢了！我觀察那個世界的同時，那個世界也在觀察我。我在注視透鏡時一定不小心召喚了某種危險、未知的生物過來。越來越多與我同行的探勘者在森林中；同時也在記憶中消失。我的夥伴、我的家、我的一切都被我在黑曜透鏡瞥見的怪物吞噬了。而現在我還是能在另一個世界看見牠們。</i>\n"
"<i>在森林裡遊蕩的怪物似乎沒有固定的形體，牠的外型一直在改變，同時具有許多不同動物的特徵，就像神話中的混種怪物。我試著使用黑曜透鏡獵捕牠，但光是看著透鏡就讓我感到頭暈目眩。在探索周邊區域後，我想我靠陷阱殺死了一隻：一隻巨大的狼形生物，牠嚎叫著消散不見。但當我隔天回到營地，營地已經被牠襲擊了。我的同伴們消失並從記憶裡被抹去。</i>\n"
"<i>有關當局認為我瘋了，應該被收治。我唯一的辦法就是將透鏡放回我找到的地方，希望能彌補這一切。也許一切都會恢復正常。”</i>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"在記錄旁有一堆黑色的素描，看起來是匆促間的隨筆塗鴉，但在看過蘭德里的經歷後，你認為這是他嘗試要畫出那個生物的外 型。隔天你開始調查任何關於蘭德里發現的金礦記錄，你從安克拉治市政廳發放的許可證跟當地圖書館開始尋找。在一整天徒勞無功的調查後，你依然找不到任何與瑞德·蘭德里相關的脈記錄。當你晚上回到木屋時，你看見一個高挑的身影站在堆滿裝備的雪橇旁，他戴著一條顯眼的紅領巾。\n"
"那人帶著自戀的笑容問候你：“你好，你一定是大家在談論的那個大麻煩。很高興認識你，我是索恩。”他自信地伸出手與你握手。“既然你在這裡，我只能推測我們是為了同樣的目標而來。請多加小心天氣，費爾班克斯可是很冷的！願最厲害的人獲勝。”說完索恩對你眨了眨眼，然後坐上雪橇離去。\n"
"你思考著索恩提到費爾班克斯是刻意誤導還是友善的提醒。你四處詢問後，一名接待員提到了你對手做的準備：“一開始我很困惑，直到他們問起部落保留區的事情，在那裡探勘不需要許可證。”你又追問了一些細節，現在你對於索恩的去向跟礦脈的位置多了一些把握。"

"Before you head out, you ask for directions from a local member of the tribe that owns the territory where you think the mine could be. They are wary of more meddling from outsiders and also concerned for your safety, given the recent trouble with prospectors on their land. You explain you aren’t interested in gold, and are researching the strange case of Mr. Landry. For good measure, you show them the prospector’s journal and the strange etching inside. This seems to buy you some trust, and the tribe member offers some directions.\n"

In my experience, such competence is beyond the Foundation. Now, I believe we have a bit of business to discuss. Please, have a seat.” Thorne says, snapping their fingers. Several Coterie members bring you to a covered awning with a fire and some chairs. Once seated, Thorne clears their throat. “Now then. We both know you have something I want. Something worth untold fortunes. Though I highly doubt you are interested in money. But what if I told you about a greater threat?” Their tone is joking, but their expression is grave. You ask them to explain. “Surely you realize it: I am not the threat here. There is something terrible that stalks these woods. The ultimate predator. As soon as you laid hands on the Sable Glass, your lives were forfeit. It will hunt you down and consume every part of you until there is nothing left, as it has done to many others.” You nod along, considering Thorne’s words. “Luckily for you, this creature is an old enemy of mine. I am uniquely suited to track its movements and lure it out.” Thorne leans forward intently. “For my services, all I ask is the Sable Glass. Believe me, you want someone that knows how to properly operate the thing, anyway.” Thorne offers their gloved hand to shake once again. “So tell me. Do we have a deal?”"

msgid "“Oh goodness gracious,” Thorne says, emerging from the mine. “Put that down at once, you oaf! This is no way to treat guests,” they snap at the guards, who lower their weapons. “You’re too late, I’m afraid. Or rather, just in time, I suppose, depending on your perspective.” Thorne brandishes an obsidian lens in one hand as they smirk. Remembering the Foundation dossier, you ask Thorne if there is anything you can do to negotiate for the Key. They shake their head. “I’m afraid not, kitten. A Key in hand is worth, well, fortunes. Not that I would sell it for anything in the world.” They clutch the Sable Glass in one hand as a chill wind blows. “However, there’s still time to make a deal. If you weren’t completely daft, you’d have noticed this entire area is in grave danger. Something truly terrible stalks these woods. The ultimate predator. In fact, it already knows we’re here.” Thorne looks to you. “The way I see it, you can pout about not getting your prize, or you can help me track my quarry. Do that and I’ll owe you a favor, to be paid at a later date. Do we have a deal?”"
msgstr "“老天啊，”索恩邊說邊從礦坑中走出來，“你們這些笨蛋，快把槍放下，這可不是待客之道。”他對兩個守衛彈了手指，他們將槍放下。“你晚來一步了，或是來的正好，取決你從哪個角度來看。”索恩微笑著晃了晃手中黑曜石製的透鏡。你想起基石的檔案，開口詢問有沒有協商密鑰歸屬的可能性。索恩揮揮手：“恐怕不行，小可愛。密鑰是無價之寶，我不會為了任何東西放棄。”寒風吹過，他手中緊抓著黑曜透鏡。“不過，我們還是可以做個交易。你如果不是笨蛋的話，就會察覺到這個地區籠罩在巨大的危險中。有某種可怕的東西在森林裡遊蕩，最終極的獵殺者。事實上，牠已經知道我們在這了。”索恩看著你，“依我看來，你可以在這裡自怨自艾，也可以幫我追蹤我的獵物。幫我的話我就欠你個人情，等待日後回報。我們達成共識了嗎？”"
