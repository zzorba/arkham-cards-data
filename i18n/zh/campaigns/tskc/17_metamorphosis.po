"At first, you are concerned that nobody recognizes Dr. Irawan’s name, but after some persistent questioning, a reluctant local offers to lead you to her. Heading into the dense underbrush, you follow a steep path up a nearby mountain until you reach a dark hollow. Leaning against the trunk of an ironwood tree, you find the zoologist peering intently into the shadows.\n"
"“I did not expect you to follow me here,” Dr. Irawan whispers. Following her lead, you sit down next to her and peer into the dark. The air around you is thick and moist. “My theory was… incorrect. Or at least, partially incorrect.” From your vantage point, you can see into a shallow dell cut by a cascading waterfall. The moon shimmers on the ripples of a narrow stream. Dr. Irawan continues: “All trace of this particular cuscus is gone, that much is for certain. The locals have no memory of them. But something is different about the disappearance. Something lingers.”\n"
"A low, moaning wail from somewhere in the trees startles you. Dr. Irawan holds out a pair of binoculars and points at a cluster of ironwood trees on the far side of the glade. Peering through, you spy three cat-sized marsupials with yellow eyes clinging to a branch, curled tails swinging in the dark. They are feeding on something. Just looking at them makes your head spin: something about them is both there and not there at once, forcing your eyes to constantly adjust. The animals’ movements are stiff and double-jointed as well, both too fast and too slow. You look away.\n"
"“You see them?” asks Dr. Irawan. You nod and look again: the cuscus are messily devouring a green python. “It is fascinating. A fundamental change. The prey have become predators. The few I have observed have made a complete shift in behavior, turning on other cuscus, hunting their own natural predators—of which the green python is one. Their very nature seems to have changed!” Dr. Irawan stammers excitedly. “But more importantly, they aren’t gone. I mean: they have gone, to some. Nobody remembers them. But yet they persist.”\n"
"You turn your binoculars back to the cuscus to find them frozen: staring straight at you with their bright, topaz eyes. Surprised, you drop the binoculars. When you look again, the cuscus are gone. Suddenly on edge, you tell Dr. Irawan it would be best to leave, but she shakes her head. “I am on the verge of the greatest discovery of the century. An entire field of para-zoological research. I cannot leave now.”\n"
"Leaving Dr. Irawan to her own devices, you head back into town. The jungle around you is eerily silent, and even as you break into a moonlit clearing, you cannot help the feeling of being watched.\n"
"Over the next few days, you make contact with the zoologist in passing. The day your ship is scheduled to leave Manokwari, Dr. Irawan is suspiciously absent from the guest house. The staff tell you she didn’t return the night before. Concerned for her safety, you return to the hollow where you met her before. The jungle retains the same unsettling quietude as you hike up the mountain.\n"
"Scattered on a rock overhanging the dark hollow are several torn-up sketchbooks and a broken pair of binoculars, but no trace of Dr. Irawan. Scanning the murky copse, you see a glimmer of light and the zoologist’s batik vest at the base of the waterfall. You carefully pick your way down the muddy slopes to the bank of a narrow stream where the zoologist lays prone, her arm bent at an odd angle. A trio of yellow-eyed cuscus scatter as you approach. Turning her over gently, you are relieved to find her still breathing. A strange black implement is clutched in her left hand, close to her chest.\n"
"A mordant call resounds from above. Dr. Irawan is surprisingly light as you scoop her up in your arms. Dozens of yellow eyes glare down at you from the ironwood trees as you carry the zoologist downstream, away from the hollow. Flitting, shimmering forms dart to and fro overhead like silent warnings.\n"
"As soon as you get back to town, you check the unconscious zoologist into a clinic. The ship you had booked has already left, but with the strange circumstances you found her in, you resolve to stay with Dr. Irawan until she wakes up. Several days pass, filled with disquieting silence, until she finally speaks.\n"
"“I noticed several cuscus gathered around this,” she thumbs the hollow bell in her good hand. “I knew better than to interfere. But they seemed so fixated on it. Much like magpies or crows will hoard certain objects. So strange. I noticed they stowed it in the crook of a branch and, so I climbed up for a better look and—well, that’s when I fell,” she says.\n"
"You hold the strange chime in your hands, appreciating its heft and form. The inlaid designs are like nothing you or the zoologist have ever seen. The metal is cool to the touch yet strangely electric. On a whim, you hold the bell up and swing it once, even though it doesn’t have a clapper. A palpable wave of sonic energy ripples through the air around you. From the trees, you can hear a familiar mournful cry.\n"
"“This has become more than a simple survey,” Dr Irawan whispers. “Whatever those creatures have become, they are no longer Phalanger septimus. Something changed.” The zoologist pauses and considers her words for a moment, then smiles at you. “Whatever is happening, I—I would prefer to not work alone. Perhaps I could continue my research with you?”\n"
"You tell Dr. Irawan you wouldn’t have it any other way, and agree to stay with her as she recovers. The zoologist entrusts the strange bell to you."

"一開始你擔心沒人認識伊拉萬博士，但在你鍥而不捨的追問下，一名當地人不情願的帶你去找她。你們走進茂密的灌木林中，沿著陡峭的小路上山，直到一個黑暗的洞穴旁。伊拉萬博士就靠在附近的鐵樹樹幹上，注視著陰影之中。\n"
"“我沒想到你會跟到這裡來。”伊拉萬博士低聲說。你照著她的指示，在她身邊坐下，也開始試著注視黑暗中的東西。周遭的空氣悶熱而潮濕。“我的理論……不太正確。至少在某些方面不完全正確。”從這個視野良好的位置，你可以看到一個瀑布支流形成的淺谷地，月光反射在小溪的水面上閃閃發亮。伊拉萬博士繼續說：“關於這種袋貂的一切都被遺忘了，這部分是對的。當地人對牠們完全沒有印象，但有一些東西沒有消失，有些部分留了下來。”\n"
"一陣低沉、如哭泣般的叫聲從樹林中傳出來。伊拉萬博士拿出一副雙筒望遠鏡看向林地另一端的鐵樹林。隔著望遠鏡，你看到三隻跟貓差不多大小的有袋動物，牠們有黃色的眼睛，攀附在樹枝上，捲曲的尾巴在黑暗中晃動，正在吃某個東西。光是看著牠們就讓你感到頭暈目眩，牠們彷彿同時存在又不存在，你的雙眼必須不斷調整焦距。那些動物的動作有時僵硬，有時又過度靈活；有時過快，又有時過慢。你移開視線。\n"
"“你看到了嗎？”伊拉萬博士問到。你點頭又再看了一次：那群袋貂正在吞食著一隻綠色樹蟒。“這太驚人了，顛覆性的變化，獵物變成了掠食者。我觀察到的部分群體完全改變了習性，轉而獵殺牠們原本的天敵，樹蟒就是其中一個例子。他們的天性發生了根本的改變！”伊拉萬博士興奮到講話結巴。“但最重要的是，牠們沒有消失。我是說：對某些人來說牠們消失了，沒人記得牠們。但牠們還在。”\n"
"你拿起望遠鏡再次看向袋貂，一瞬間你的血液彷彿凍結了：因為牠們正用明亮的黃色眼睛回看著你。你震驚到望遠鏡脫手掉落。但當你再度定睛看時，牠們全都不見了。你突然感到極度不安，試著說服伊拉萬博士離開，但她搖頭拒絕。“我正在目睹一個世紀大發現，這已經超越了動物學的範疇了，我不能現在離開。”\n"
"你留下伊拉萬博士，回頭朝小鎮的方向走。周遭的叢林詭異的寧靜，即使你走進月光照耀的空地時，你還是感覺到有東西在監視你。\n"
"接下來幾天你與伊拉萬博士保持著聯繫。但在你們要乘船離開的那天，她卻不在客房中。旅館員工告訴你她昨晚沒有回來。你很擔心她的安危，決定前往之前見到她的山洞。當你爬上山時，周遭的叢林依然瀰漫著令人不安的寂靜。\n"
"黑暗的山洞前四散著素描本的碎片跟損壞的望遠鏡，但沒有伊拉萬博士的蹤影。你看向昏暗的矮林，看見伊拉萬博士身上穿的蠟染背心在瀑布底部反射著亮光。你小心的走下泥濘的斜坡，來到動物學家身處的小溪河床上，她面朝下趴著，手臂彎成不正常的角度，三隻袋貂在你靠近時四散而逃。你輕輕的將她翻過來，感覺到她還有呼吸時鬆了一口氣。她的左手放在胸前，手中似乎握著某個黑色的物品。\n"
"你將伊拉萬博士抱起來，她意外地輕。同時間，你頭上傳來尖銳的叫聲，幾十隻黃色的眼睛從鐵樹上看著你揹著博士遠離洞穴，向下游走去。發著微光的形體在你頭上若即若離的飄盪，似乎在警告著你什麼。\n"
"你一回到小鎮就將昏迷的博士帶到診所進行檢查。你訂的船早已離開了，但有鑑於發生在博士身上的狀況，你決定在此等她醒來。在經過幾天坐立難安的等待後，她終於能開口說話。\n"
"“我注意到有幾隻袋貂聚集在這個東西周圍。”她指著之前抓在手裡的中空響鐘說：“我不應該干涉的，但牠們似乎非常受其吸引。很奇怪，通常只有喜鵲或烏鴉會蒐集這類物品。我發現牠們將它藏在樹枝上，所以爬上去想更仔細的觀察，然後就跌了下來。”\n"
"你拿起奇怪的響鐘，感受它的重量跟形狀。上面的浮雕對你跟博士來說都非常陌生。金屬摸起來很冰冷，還帶著一絲電流。你出於好奇，搖了它兩下，即使沒有鈴舌，它發出的音波強到足以在空氣中泛起漣漪，你甚至能感受到這股能量。屋外的樹上傳出了熟悉的哀泣聲。\n"
"“這已經不只是一場生態調查了。”伊拉萬博士低語著。“不管這些生物是什麼，牠們都不再是賽提米烏斯貂了，牠們被改變了。”這位動物學家停頓了一下，斟酌著用詞，然後對你微笑著說：“不管現在正發生什麼事，我希望不用孤軍奮戰，也許我可以跟著你一起完成我的研究？”\n"
"你告訴伊拉萬博士這樣再好不過了，並同意等到她痊癒再一起離開。她信任地將奇怪的響鐘交給你保管。"

After several days, you abandon your fruitless search. As you check out from the local guest house, you find a blank sketchbook sitting on a wicker table. Picking it up, your skin pricks, and you have the feeling of being watched. But when you turn around, you are completely alone."
msgstr "你四處詢問伊拉萬博士的下落，但回應你的只有好奇與疑惑的眼神。你甚至試著模仿她特別的圓框眼鏡，但沒有人認得她的名字或長相。幾天後你放棄了這趟無果的搜尋。在你退房時，你在一張藤編的桌子上找到一本空白的素描本。你拿起它，突然感到一陣惡寒，感覺像有東西在看著你。但你轉身時身後卻空無一人。"
