"You awaken in darkness. A sack is removed from your head and cast aside, and your cheek is squeezed and struck once or twice for good measure. “Wake up,” a sinister voice commands. You blink unconsciousness away and realize, with some panic, that you and your partners are bound to chairs. A gag prevents you from making any noise louder than a muffled cry.\n"
"As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you realize you must be underground. The large, windowless chamber is made of clean, worked stone, lit faintly by mercury vapor lamps. Scarlet tapestries line the walls, along with several glass cases and shelves containing old relics and historical artifacts. Dominating the room is an enormous central table, an elaborate pattern of lines and rings carved meticulously along its surface. Standing around this central table are a host of figures, some familiar to you, others unrecognizable. All of them bear red. Your heart surges in your throat. “You have been brought here to account for your crimes against the Coterie,” the voice states, “or to be commended, if that is the will of the Congress. We will now entertain any who wish to speak on your behalf, or against you.”"

"你在一片黑暗中醒來，突然你頭上的布袋被抽開扔在一旁，有人掐著你的臉頰並拍了一兩下確認你已經清醒。“起來。”一個惡毒的聲音下令。你眨著眼想清醒過來，然後驚慌地發現你跟你的夥伴們被綁在椅子上，嘴裡塞著口銜，讓你們只能發出模糊的哼聲。\n"
"你的眼睛適應昏暗的光線後，你發現自己一定身處地底下。這座沒有窗戶的大廳由俐落、做工良好的石材砌成，水銀燈發出的微光照亮牆面，牆上有緋紅色的裝飾，牆邊有幾個玻璃展示櫃，裡面放著各種文物或具有歷史性的工藝品。而最顯眼的是房間中央的巨大桌子，桌面上有精雕細琢的各種圖案與線條。一群身影站在大桌旁，有些很眼熟；其他的都不認識，但他們全都穿戴著緋紅色。你感到非常不安。“你們將為了對結社做過的事付出代價；抑或是接受表揚，一切皆由峰會決定。”先前的聲音宣告著。“現在，我們將允許所有人發言，無論是指控；或是辯護。”"

"You would never have found the secret hideout of the Red Coterie without the intel Commissioner Taylor sent you. The compound lies deep underground in the heart of Siberia, not far from the mysterious crater that marks the site of the notorious Tunguska event—a blast, or perhaps impact, the true nature of which has been shrouded in mystery for over a decade. Maybe there is a connection between this strange event and the Coterie’s presence—no, knowing the kind of dangerous artifacts the Coterie possesses, there is no doubt in your mind. The question is: which came first?\n"
"The compound’s entrance is masked by heavy snow and remote wilderness, but eventually, you find it—an unmarked steel door embedded in the side of a snowy hilltop, almost impossible to see from afar. You are surprised to find the door unlocked… but the moment you enter, you are set upon by Coterie guards with suspicious eyes and familiar red clothing. “We’ve been expecting you,” one of them says with a wicked grin. “Come. The Congress is about to begin.”\n"
"You have little choice but to follow. The guards lead you deeper and deeper into the complex, down steep, narrow stairways of worked stone and through dark, drab corridors, until finally you reach a large, windowless chamber lit faintly by mercury vapor lamps. Scarlet tapestries line the walls, along with several glass cases and shelves containing old relics and historical artifacts. Dominating the room is an enormous central table, an elaborate pattern of lines and rings carved meticulously along its surface. Standing around this central table are a host of figures, some familiar to you, others unrecognizable. All of them bear red. The door leading into the chamber slams shut behind you, and your heart surges in your throat. “Your timing is impeccable,” a voice among the gathered Coterie states. “We were just about to begin the vote.”\n"
"You inquire as to the nature of this vote, your mouth suddenly dry. You cannot shake the feeling that you have come here merely to look your own doom in the eyes. “A meeting has been called. To account for your crimes against the Coterie, or to be commended, if that is the will of the Congress. We will now entertain any who wish to speak on your behalf, or against you.” From behind, you are suddenly restrained and a gag is placed over your mouth. “Just a formality, I promise you,” the guard drawls with a grin."

"如果沒有調查官泰勒提供的情報，你一定找不到緋紅結社的秘密據點。它藏身在西伯利亞中心的地底，距離通古斯的神祕大坑不遠，這場十幾年前發生的大爆炸或是撞擊，其真實原因依然成謎。也許這個事件與結社有某種關聯——不，有鑑於他們掌握的危險物品，必定與他們有關。問題是前因後果是什麼？\n"
"據點入口隱藏在大雪與荒蕪的原野中，但你終於還是找到了。扇鐵門隱藏在覆滿白雪的山丘側面，不走近幾乎無法辨認。你很驚訝地發現門沒有上鎖，但你進入時，馬上撞見身穿熟悉紅色服飾的結社守衛，他們用懷疑的眼神看著你。其中一名守衛帶著邪魅的笑容開口說道：“我們正等著你的到來。來吧，峰會要開始了。”\n"
"你沒什麼選擇，只好跟著他們。守衛領著你深入地下，走過狹窄的樓梯與單調的石砌廊道。終於你們抵達一間沒有窗戶的大廳，水銀燈發出的微光照亮牆面，牆上有緋紅色的裝飾，牆邊有幾個玻璃展示櫃，裡面放著各種文物或具有歷史性的工藝品。而最顯眼的是房間中央的巨大桌子，桌面上有精雕細琢的各種圖案與線條。一群身影站在大桌旁，有些很眼熟；其他的都不認識，但他們全都穿戴著緋紅色。大門在你身後轟然關上，你瞬間感到非常不安。從人群中傳出一個聲音宣告道：“你的時機正好，我們正要開始進行投票。”\n"
"你出聲詢問投票的目的時，嘴唇突然變得乾燥，你無法擺脫自己是主動前來面對毀滅的感覺。“一場集會被召開了。你將為了對結社做過的事付出代價；抑或是接受表揚，一切皆由峰會決定。現在，我們將允許所有人發言，無論是指控；或是辯護。”突然你被從後方束縛住並塞上口銜。守衛笑著說道：“這只是出於正式的程序，我保證。”"

A cold blade is placed at the edge of your neck. “You who seek to harm our noble cause have been accused and charged with numerous crimes against the Coterie,” a voice states with dreadful gravity. The blade bites against your skin. A trail of blood trickles down your neck. “The punishment is death. May the crimson stain of your legacy be washed away.” You close your eyes and brace yourself.\n"

You struggle again to free yourself, but are unable… until moments later, when you are dragged out of the chamber. Your bonds are cut, and you are brought to your feet by none other than the woman in the vermillion veil herself. Ece ushers you down the hall, whispering over the chaos of the battle. “We have to get out of here.” Several of the others who wear red follow in your wake, looking over their shoulders the entire time.\n"

"You ask her to start again, slower. “He attacked us,” she says, meeting your gaze as you duck into a quiet hall filled with scarlet tapestries. “The others fought him off, but… there was something strange about him. He was not human. It was something else entirely. It stole as many implements as it could and escaped, like…” she shudders. “…just like one of the creatures we seek to destroy.”\n"

For too long, they have used their collected power not to guard humanity, but to plague it. As you speak, several of the people you have met nod amongst themselves. “They’re right,” the girl in the red coat announces, gesturing at several of the others who look on with sneers. “You all say you are motivated by a duty to humanity, yet you tolerate the presence of those who only do others harm. If this is the kind of organization you really are, I no longer wish to be a part of it.”\n"

You are sent reeling as your captors, too, are expunged from reality. You crawl along the ground as the fray rages on, eventually finding a shard of glass upon which to cut your bonds. By the time you free your companions and rise to your feet, the entities have fled. The last thing you see is the shapeless elongated remnants of the Red-Gloved Man escaping out the door you came from.\n"
"You survey the damage, but surprisingly, there isn’t much to look at. Save for you and a few articles of discarded and forgotten red attire, the chamber is completely empty.\n"
"To your horror, you recall none of their names or monikers. Not a single one."

"你恐懼地看著更多的身影開始扭曲變形，殘暴地屠殺周圍所有人。一瞬間，金屬撞擊聲跟槍聲同時作響在大廳之中。每位被殺害的結社成員都被抹除了存在，當抓捕你的人也被從現實中抹去時，你完全不知所措。你在激烈的戰鬥中匍匐在地，最後終於找到一片銳利的玻璃將束縛割開。當你將同伴解救出來時，那些存在已經逃離了。你最後看見的是紅手套已經不成人形的身影從你進來的大門逃離。\n"

"With the trial proceedings over, the Congress finally reaches other affairs. “There is still the matter of the Outsiders,” one among them states. “We have assembled our strength in order to prepare for the inevitable, but how can we be certain our dimension is of any interest to them? We cannot seek to understand such abstruse entities.”\n"
"You chime in, telling the Congress of everything you have seen during your travels and your operations with the Foundation: the strange happenings across the globe have only grown in frequency, and you have reason to believe they are intelligent and malicious—not mindless and incomprehensible. What’s worse, they appear to be after the very same keys as everyone else.\n"
"“If they are stirring, preparing for war,” another member declares, “then we must do the same. We have among our assembly bearers of the most powerful artufacts this order has uncovered. Let us put them to good use and exterminate this threat once and for all.” Nods and murmurs of consent ripple throughout the assembly.\n"
"“But if they are intelligent entities as our new friends claim they are, how could they possibly know so much of our inner workings?” Your detractor argues. A dreadful hunch stirs in your mind. You scan the room and remark that one among the Congress is missing. The rest of the assembly follows your gaze, with several of them standing to search the chamber more thoroughly. One of them confirms your suspicions by raising a single red glove, discarded and forgotten as though mundane, immaterial.\n"
"The woman in the vermillion veil is the first to understand your thread of logic. “Spread out,” she shouts, her voice warbling. “Find him. Learn where he is headed. And be ready for anything.”\n"
"It doesn’t take long before the doorway is found—a shimmering portal of extradimensional energy, ebbing with eldritch power. “It’s closing,” one of the others observes. Indeed, the doorway seems to be shrinking as it steadily swirls, and soon enough there will be nothing left of it. “We don’t have much time.”"

"審判終於告一段落，終於可以將峰會的注意力轉向其他事務。其中一位成員發言：“異域存在依然是個威脅。我們不斷積蓄力量準備面對無法避免的危機，但我們如何確定牠們是否真的對我們的次元有興趣呢？我們無法理解那些詭秘的存在。”\n"
"你插話，說出所有你在旅程中與基石的行動中看到的所有關於那些存在的情報。發生在世界各地的奇異事件越來越頻繁，而且你有理由認為這些生物是有智慧且滿懷惡意的，而非無計畫的依循本能行動。更糟的是，你認為牠們也同樣在追尋密鑰。\n"
"另一名成員說道：“如果他們在蠢蠢欲動，準備發動戰爭，那我們也必須做好準備。我們應該召集我們之中最強的人，帶上我們力量最強大的密鑰。我們應該利用密鑰的力量清除這個威脅，永絕後患。”群眾中泛起一陣同意的低語。\n"
"“但如果牠們像這位新朋友說的這麼聰明，牠們又是怎麼對我們內部運作瞭如指掌呢？”一名成員提出懷疑。你帶著一股不祥的預感掃視大廳，發現其中一名成員不見了。其他人注意到你的視線，起身更仔細的搜尋整座大廳。其中一個人證明了你的恐懼，一隻紅色手套被丟棄在角落，彷彿它對所有者毫無意義。\n"
