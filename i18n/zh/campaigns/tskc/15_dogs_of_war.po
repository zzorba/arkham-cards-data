"From the moment you step off the train in Alexandria, your hackles are raised. Dark clouds gather over the city, and waves crash ominously against the Mediterranean coastline. But the brewing storm is not what worries you—it’s your tail.\n"
"It started with just a few of them. Local authorities, you suspect. Or at least, that seems to be their cover. They could be Foundation agents keeping tabs on you to ensure you remain on task, or Coterie operatives looking to take out a potential threat. You navigate your way through the streets toward the Windsor Hotel, where you have a room booked for the night, but everywhere you turn, you spot more of them. You begin to formulate a plan just in case. Perhaps you can confront one by surprise, interrogate them, learn what they are after… but your thoughts are interrupted when a group of them beat you to the punch.\n"
"“Welcome to Alexandria, agents. Yes, we know who you are,” one of them says, but to your surprise, he raises his hands and shows that he bears no weapons. Now that you are closer, you can easily spot the telltale scarlet trappings among their persons—ties, cufflinks, and the like. “Don’t worry, we come in peace. One of our number wishes to speak with you. We have a problem in Alexandria that perhaps you can help us with.”\n"
"You scoff, incredulous at the audacity of such a request. You have no intention of walking into the Beast’s trap. “I understand why you’re wary,” the agent says, “but I think you will find this agreement to your liking. If you come seeking the Beast, believe it or not, our goals are aligned. This invitation comes from one much wiser and far less dangerous, I assure you. Come. We have much to discuss.”\n"
"You consider your options, but trap or no trap, you can’t pass up an opportunity to speak with a high-ranking member of the Coterie. Information is your best weapon right now, and no matter what, this can only help to inform you. You agree to follow, but keep an eye on your escorts, just in case.\n"
"To your surprise, the agents lead you by way of a horse-drawn carriage to the Bourse—the stock exchange building in the heart of the city. You follow your escorts through a bustling crowd wearing the finest clothes, up several flights of stairs, and through a locked office door on the top floor of the exchange. Immediately, you realize this must be no ordinary stock exchange, but a Coterie hideout of some kind. The office on the other side is an enormous suite, adorned with a surprising number of ancient relics and Euro-centric art, including a rather large portrait of a knight wearing a suit of scarlet-plated armor."

"當你在亞歷山卓下車的瞬間，你的寒毛都豎了起來。烏雲籠罩著城市，來自地中海的波濤不祥地打在海岸線上。但即將來臨的風暴不是你感到不安的原因，而是那些跟蹤你的人。\n"
"一開始只有寥寥數人，你猜是當地政府的人員，至少他們的偽裝看起來是這樣。也許是基石派來確保你忠實執行任務的人；又或許是來監視潛在威脅的結社爪牙。你走在街道上，向著你晚上入住的溫莎飯店前進，但每次你轉頭時都看到更多的人在聚集。你開始思考計畫，以防萬一。也許你可以出奇不意的直面他們，質問他們到底想要什麼。但突然一群人擋住你的去路，中斷你的思緒。\n"
"“歡迎來到亞歷山卓，探員。沒錯，我們知道你是誰。”其中一人開口說，出乎你意料的是，他舉起手向你示意自己沒帶武器。在這個距離下你清楚看到他們身上的紅色配件，領帶、袖扣之類的，洩漏了他們的身份。“別緊張，我們沒有惡意，我們之中有人想跟你談談，你也許可以幫我們解決這裡的一些問題。”\n"
"你無法置信他們提出這麼直接的要求，你譏諷的說自己可不打算踏入野獸的陷阱。他回答：“我了解你的顧慮，但我保證你會願意考慮這個交易。如果你是來找野獸的，那我們的目標是一樣，信不信由你。這個邀請是來自於一位更有智慧也更不具威脅性的成員，我向你保證。來吧，我們有很多事要討論。”\n"
"你考慮了一下，不管是不是陷阱，你都不能錯過一個跟結社高層會面的機會。情報是你最有力的武器，而不管結果如何，這場會面將會讓你得知更多情報。你同意跟他們走，但以防萬一，你一路上都對護送你的人保持警戒。\n"
"出乎你意料之外，你們搭著馬車來到市中心的證券交易所。你跟著護送你的人穿越穿著華貴的忙碌人群，登上樓梯，走過上鎖的大門來到建築物頂層。你突然意識到這裏不是單純的交易所，而是結社的據點。門的另一邊是間巨大的房間，裝飾著許多文物跟中世紀歐洲的藝術品，包含一座穿著緋紅色全套盔甲的騎士雕像。"

You’re surprised to find the man to be clearly of European descent, perhaps English or French. Though his hair is graying and thin, and his face wrinkled with long lines of worry, he seems surprisingly spry and large in stature. He rests his hand on a polished silver cane, but doesn’t seem to need it to walk. If you didn’t know any better, you would think him to be much younger than he lets on."
msgstr "這裡的主人在你走進房間時歡迎你，他是一名看起來像是英裔或法裔的長者，他穿著一襲紅色的古典正裝，披著棕色的外套。“啊，客人來了。”他示意請你入座。他的口音明顯來自歐洲，可能是英國或法國。雖然他滿頭白髮、身形單薄，憂慮在他臉上刻下許多皺紋，但他身上散發著充滿活力且威嚴的氣息。他靠在一根鋥亮的銀色拐杖上，但看起來似乎並不需要靠它走路。如果要你猜的話，你覺得他並沒有外表看起來這麼年邁。"

"“I suppose you have many questions. First, introductions are in order. I have gone by several names in my long tenure, but you may simply call me the Claret Knight, as others do. I know why you are here. You come seeking this, do you not?” He unlocks a nearby armoire, and as its door opens, a flash of light illuminates the room. Inside is a crystal vial containing a shimmering sapphire substance. It is, without a doubt, the Key you have come here to find. Immediately, your mind races, brimming with possibility. But with many of the knight’s agents standing right behind you, you decide to stay on your best behavior… for now.\n"
"“We have guarded this implement—the Light of Pharos—for many years. Protected it from those who would use it to harm, rather than guide, humanity. Only we have the capacity to do so. To keep such powers out of the hands of knaves and troublemakers. Now, here is the issue: there is another who desires the Light of Pharos, one who is far less benevolent.”\n"
"The Beast, you suspect aloud. “Indeed,” the knight confirms. “And before you ask—yes, that creature is counted among the members of our esteemed organization.” You wonder aloud why two members of the Coterie might be squabbling instead of working together. “Yes, well, membership requirements have been lax in recent years,” he jokes with a chuckle. “The truth is, I bear no particular fondness for this Beast. Its methods are unsavory. It draws too much unwanted attention.” His eyes, deep and blue as a dark ocean, meet with yours to emphasize his point.\n"
"You remind your host that time is of the essence, and ask where this is leading. “Of course,” he obliges. “As I said, we have guarded this implement for countless generations. It would be a shame for it to fall into the hands of the unworthy or uncouth, would it not? But the Beast draws nigh. It spills the blood of friend, foe, and bystander in its path here. Its path to us. It is after the Light, and as the Light’s protector, I must do everything in my power to stop it. As such, I have summoned you here to strike a bargain.” He nods to one of his agents, who closes the armoire and seals it shut. There is a rush of air, and a sensation of building pressure throughout the room as the door shuts tight. Your ears pop with a painful change of pressure.\n"
"“This is a place of power, one of several throughout the city which we have established to prevent uninvited guests from entering. Had you not been escorted, you might have turned to ash. But any such locus can be destroyed, and then the Beast would descend upon us like a starving wolf. We cannot be everywhere at once. Help us defend the locuses, so that we may retain guardianship of the Light of Pharos. In return, I’ll tell you what you wish to know about our organization. And you will have prevented catastrophe from befalling this fair city, which has seen more than enough calamity already. What do you say? Can we rely upon you to make the right choice?”"

"“我相信你一定有很多疑問，但請先容我自我介紹，在我漫長的一生中有過許多稱呼，但你可以和其他人一樣，簡單的稱呼我為酒紅騎士。我知道你為何而來，你正在尋找這個，對嗎？”他打開旁邊的一個櫃子，當門打開時，一道光照亮了房間。櫃中是一個透明的小瓶，裡面裝著藍寶石色澤的液體，毫無疑問，這就是你在追尋的密鑰。你的思緒飛快的運轉起來，考慮著各種可能的方案，但在場有太多騎士的手下，你最後還是決定拿出你最禮貌的姿態……至少暫時這樣。\n"
"“我們已經守護這個聖物：法羅斯之光很長一段時間了。保護它不落入作惡的人手中，我們用它來引導人類。只有我們有能力讓它免於惡人與狂人的掌握。現在的問題是：有其他人覬覦法羅斯之光，一個遠不能稱為正派的人。”\n"
"是野獸，你大聲說出推測。騎士確認了你的說法：“沒錯。而在你開口問前——沒錯，牠是我們榮譽結社的一員。”你說出你的疑問，為什麼兩名結社成員會互相衝突，而不是合作？“這個嘛，近年來入會的標準有點低。”騎士輕笑著開玩笑說。“事實上是，我對野獸沒有好感，我無法認同牠的作風，牠吸引了太多不必要的注意。”他如海洋般深藍色的雙眼定睛注視你，彷彿想取得更多信任。\n"
"你提醒他時間不多，他到底想要什麼？他回應：“當然。就像我說的，我們代代守護這個聖物，如果讓它落到不對的人手中就太可惜了，不是嗎？但野獸步步逼近，在牠看來，朋友、敵人，甚至毫不相關的人都只是牠前進路上的小小犧牲品。牠在逼近我們，逼近法羅斯之光。身為它的守護者，我必須盡我所能保護它的安全，所以我將你找來，提出一個交易。”他向其中一名手下點點頭，手下將櫃門關起並鎖上。空氣泛起一陣波動，櫃門關上的同時，一股壓力降臨到整座建物上，你的耳朵在壓力變化下感到一陣疼痛。\n"
"“這是一個力量之地，我們在城市中建造了數個這樣的地方來防止不速之客。如果你不是被護送進來，就會被燒成灰燼。但這樣的護所還是可能被摧毀，然後野獸就能像惡狼一般撲到我們身上。我們沒辦法同時身處數地，我們需要你的幫助守衛護所，才能維持法羅斯之光的防護圈。作為回報，我會告訴你關於我們組織的事。而同時你可以保護這座美麗的城市，它已經遭受過太多苦難了。你說呢？我可以仰賴你做出正確的選擇嗎？”"

I know why you are here. You come seeking that which we have guarded for many centuries. But even were I inclined to hand it over—which I am not—you are too late.” He gestures toward a nearby armoire, which has been torn nearly to shreds. Its door dangles from its hinges, and inside it is empty and dark.\n"
"“The Light of Pharos has been our charge in Alexandria for countless years. We have protected it from those who would use it to harm, rather than guide, humanity. But, I am afraid it has been stolen. And as such, until we can recover it, we are at war.”\n"
"The Beast, you suspect aloud. “Indeed,” the knight confirms. “And before you ask—yes, that creature is counted among the members of our esteemed organization.” You wonder aloud why two members of the Coterie might be in conflict instead of working together. “Yes, well, I fought tooth and nail to prevent it from joining our ranks, if you’ll pardon the pun,” he says grimly. “The truth is, I despise this Beast. Its methods are unsavory. It draws too much unwanted attention.” His eyes, deep and blue as a dark ocean, meet with yours as he emphasizes his point.\n"
"You remind your host that time is of the essence, and ask where this is leading. “Of course,” he obliges. “Surely we agree that we cannot let this implement remain in the hands of such a monster. It would be safer here, under lock and key, where it has been for countless generations. As its protector, I must do everything in my power to recover it. As such, I have summoned you here to strike a bargain.” He nods to one of his agents, who shows you a map of the city. Marked in several spots are buildings circled in red.\n"
"“These are locuses—places of power that were established throughout the city to prevent uninvited guests from entering a particular stronghold. They were once linked to this place, but now, this power has been usurped by the Beast. The Light of Pharos is somewhere in the city, protected by our very own magic. If we can destroy each locus and enter the Beast’s lair, we can take back the artifact and retain it here, where it belongs. In return, I’ll tell you what you wish to know about our organization. And you will have prevented catastrophe from befalling this fair city, which has seen more than enough calamity already. What do you say? Can we rely upon you to make the right choice?”"

"“A shame,” the knight intones, his tenor changing almost immediately. “Very well. We shall have to deal with this threat ourselves, and I am afraid I must ask you to leave the city at once.” You protest, but the knight’s agents close in around you. He rises to a stature you did not expect from such an elderly man, his voice commanding the kind of authority mentioned only in myth. “You are no longer guests in my city. We will not suffer a war on two fronts. Depart from Alexandria immediately or suffer the consequences.”\n"
"Although it pains you to leave when your goal lies so close, if what the knight said is true, you would have to break the various locuses around the city in order to claim your prize, and you are surrounded and outnumbered, besides. You decide it is best to exit the Coterie’s stronghold and regroup before making a run at the Key.\n"
"But, as is often the case, fate has other plans. The moment you leave the Bourse, you are accosted by a man in a pinstripe suit and a red fez. Bewilderingly, he flashes a Foundation badge and makes a motion to follow him into a nearby alley. You make sure you aren’t still being watched, then abscond into the alleyway, where the man greets you in English. “Hossam Sirry, at your service. Commissioner Taylor told me you’d be coming. That dossier you got? I put that intel together myself.” You study the man’s face for a moment. Unlike the so-called Claret Knight and his Coterie entourage up in the Bourse, he looks native to the area, with brown skin, dark brown eyes and a chiseled, stubbled jawline. Still, your eyes cannot help but dance warily to the one article of red he wears upon his head. He rolls his eyes and gives a slight chuckle. “Do not worry. I am not with them. You would be hard pressed to find this kind of headwear in any other color.” You let out a sigh of relief. “I take it from the way you were escorted out of there that you didn’t take their offer?”\n"
"You tell Agent Sirry what happened inside the Bourse. “You made the right call,” he says. “Those Coterie dogs have been entrenched in Alexandria for as long as anyone can remember. They think this city is theirs, but it’s not. It belongs to the people. It belongs to us.” His disdain is unmistakable. It’s not just for the Coterie—it’s for the people who aim to wrest control of the city away from those who call it home. “They come here from afar and act like their governance, their occupation, is some kind of gift.”\n"
"Agent Sirry puts a hand on your shoulder. “Let us help one another. Your objective is to claim the knight’s Key for your own, yes? This will also weaken the Coterie’s control over this city. That is a result I can get behind.” You nod in agreement. This conflict may not be as personal for you as it is for Sirry, but you’ll stop at nothing to help."

"“可惜。”騎士嘆了口氣，語氣瞬間改變。“很好，我們會獨自面對這個威脅，但我恐怕必須要求你立即離開這座城市。”你不同意，但騎士的手下開始向你逼近。騎士起身，你沒想過一名老人身上能散發出這種壓迫感，他帶著天神般的威嚴命令道：“你在我的城市中不再受到歡迎，我們不會放任自己同時面對兩名對手。立刻離開，不然就準備承擔後果。”\n"

He has cleaned up a bit since you last met him, and there is a brightness in his eyes and his smile that was not present before. He joyfully sums up what has occurred since you went dark. “The knight and his entourage seem to have left Alexandria,” he declares, wearing a satisfied grin. “It seems, for all their posturing about ‘guiding humanity’ and ‘rightful rule,’ the moment their relic left their hands, their stake in the city vanished with it. That other creature seems to have fled as well. Still…” His eyes dance to the vessel containing the Key, its light trapped within. “I doubt you’ve seen the last of them.

He and that hideous creature are in all-out war now, and of course, my people are the ones who suffer.” He slams his fist on the table in anger. “That’s how it always is with these bastards. They’ll do whatever they can to stay in power, innocents be damned. Frankly, I can’t even tell which of them is worse.”\n"
"You apologize that you weren’t able to help more, and he shakes his head. “No, don’t apologize. You did everything you could. What will you do now?” Your window of opportunity in Alexandria has passed, so you tell Agent Sirry you’ll be taking the next train out to search for more Keys elsewhere. You wonder aloud if he might come with you. “I have a new assignment as well, but…” he scratches his beard thoughtfully. “I fear what may come to pass in my beloved city with this feud going on. I might end up staying. Orders or no orders.” He stands and shakes your hand, and you fear it may be the last time. “I hope to see you again some time. Until then… I have work to do.”"

"You are escorted by agents in red back to your patron’s office safehouse within the Bourse. The place has been cleaned up significantly since you were last there, and a brand new vault sits next to the grand painting of the familiar scarlet-clad knight. You hand over the Key as agreed, and it is placed back inside the vault and sealed shut. There is a rush of air, and a sensation of building pressure throughout the room as the door shuts tight. Your ears pop with a painful change of pressure—no doubt the work of their so-called “locuses.”\n"

msgid "You ask the knight what the Red Coterie is truly about. So far, you have seen its members be both brutal and reasonable. And why all the secrecy? “I have not lied to you. We seek only to protect humanity.” He points to the vault wherein the Light of Pharos is still safely sealed away. “These objects, they are too powerful to be wielded by just anyone, and too precious to be kept unaccounted. I’m sure by now you have noticed the influence of other entities upon our world. Outsiders, we call them. These relics are the only line of defense against such entities. The Coterie keeps them safe, to be used only to do battle with the Outsiders. That is why I could not suffer this artifact to fall into the hands of that beast. Aliki is the one who does most of our research regarding the Outsiders—if you wish to know more, perhaps find her. Last anyone heard from her was around Kathmandu, I believe. But you will need to find a translator if you wish to speak with her. She is cryptic and difficult to understand.” He glances at the portrait of the knight clad in crimson armor that looms behind him. “As for all the red… handling relics of an otherworldly nature is both dangerous and conspicuous. So, we have bound them to one or more articles of clothing, to better blend in with society. The process, for whatever reason, turns them red. Of course, there are other benefits too. Think of it as a… secret handshake, if you will.” He raises an eyebrow as he appraises you. “We have, in the past, inducted new members into our ranks, should they prove themselves both trustworthy and capable, as you have. Perhaps one day you shall bear red upon your person, as well. Now, I believe I have fulfilled my end of this bargain. I once again thank you for your aid. My people will compensate your travel expenses.” With that, the conversation comes to a friendly, if abrupt end."
