msgid "You arrive in London and follow Agent Quinn’s directions to get to the town of Amesbury. Immediately after checking into a hotel, your concierge wordlessly hands you a note with an address by the side of a park on the western side of the historic town. You head there immediately, only to find Agent Ari Quinn sitting in the driver’s seat of a Bentley, reading a newspaper and not paying you any heed. Without making a scene, you silently climb into the passenger seat. “Finally. Been waiting here all day.” You’re not even sure how Quinn knew you’d arrived in town, but you suppose the Foundation must have eyes and ears all over every harbor and border checkpoint. You ask her what she’s been up to, and what she wanted to show you, at which point she starts the Bentley’s engine and rolls along the road to the west. “You’ll see.” Just a short drive later, you come to a familiar sight. You should have known—Quinn has taken you to the site of mysterious and prehistoric Stonehenge. A ring of standing stones marks the site, inside which another ring of smaller bluestones seem to serve no particular purpose whatsoever. A few tourists peruse the monument in awe, but it is otherwise quiet. You follow close behind and ask Agent Quinn why she asked you to come all this way. “Strange place, is it not?” she asks. A rhetorical question—historians have long debated over the likely function of the landmark, but none know for certain. As you draw nearer, she points to the various standing stones and to the concentric ring of smaller stones inside. “Almost seems like something is missing.”"
msgstr "你抵達倫敦後依循奎茵探員給的方向前往埃姆斯伯里。你在旅館登記入住時，櫃台人員不發一語的塞給你一張紙條，上面是位於這個小鎮西邊的一座公園的地址。你立即前往那裡，看見艾里·奎茵探員坐在一輛賓利的駕駛座上，她看著報紙，沒對你做任何暗示。你沒有試著引起她注意，只是靜靜的坐進副駕駛座。“終於來了，我已經等了一整天了。”你不確定她是怎麼知道你已經抵達小鎮的，但你猜也許基石在每個港口跟邊境檢查哨都有耳目吧。你問她在計畫什麼，還有她想給你看些什麼。她只是發動引擎並開上往西的道路。“你待會就知道了。”開了一小段路程後，你們到了一個熟悉的地點，你早該猜到的，奎茵帶你來到了神祕的史前巨石陣。矗立的巨石形成一個圓環，其中還有一個由藍石圍起的小環，不知是否有什麼特殊意義。除了觀光客偶爾發出的讚嘆聲，這裡非常安靜。你跟在奎茵探員身後並問她為什麼要大老遠來到這。“奇怪的地方，不是嗎?”她只是問了個不言而喻的問題。歷史學家們對於這個地標的功能有著漫長的辯論，但沒有人能肯定。當你們走近，她指著幾個矗立的巨石跟內部較小的圓環說：“看起來就像少了什麼東西。”"

msgid "Quinn’s demeanor changes when she sees the look on your face. “Well, that triggered something. Still going to play it tight-lipped?” She heads to the center of the bluestone ring and takes out a small contraption possessing a series of lights along its surface. It lets out several beeps, rising in frequency as she reaches the very center. “Yeah, that just about confirms my suspicions… but I’m still missing the why. So, enlighten me, since you seem to know more than I do: what the hell could have made part of a structure vanish not just from existence, but from recorded history as well?”"
msgstr "奎茵看到你臉上的表情後終於打破冷漠：“看来你終於有反應了，還堅持要守口如瓶嗎？”她拿出一個上面有許多燈光警示的奇怪裝置，然後走向藍石圈的中心。裝置在她手中發出聲響，警示聲的頻率隨著她靠近中心而逐漸升高。“沒錯，這證實了我的猜測……但我還是不知道原因。很明顯你知道得比我多，告訴我：到底是什麼原因能讓整個結構消失，還同時從歷史紀錄中被抹除？。”"

msgid "You tell Quinn everything—about the entities you were investigating in London, about their presumed connection to the Red Coterie, all of it. She listens intently, hanging on every word. “So these things, these… let us presume to call them ‘extraterrestrials,’ when they take something, it vanishes completely. Do you understand what this means?” You know a great many conclusions that could be drawn from these events, but you encourage her to continue on her own. “Everything we know, everything we can see, it’s just what’s left. Look at Stonehenge. We have no earthly clue what it is. Maybe that’s because it’s incomplete. There could have been dozens of other structures erected right where we stand and humanity would never know.” She paces back and forth, agitated. “This is my life’s work. I’ve studied these kinds of events for over a decade. Paranormal disappearances. Dead civilizations. Bloody hell, I’m fluent in a dozen dead languages. I’ve always assumed these events are a small slice of pie missing from the greater whole. But what if we’re only seeing what’s left—the tiny slice of pie these creatures haven’t stolen?”"
msgstr "你對奎茵全盤托出，關於你在倫敦調查的奇異存在，還有牠們與緋紅結社可能的關聯性。她仔細聽著，思考著每一個描述。“所以這些東西……我們先姑且稱牠‘外星生物’，當牠們帶走某個東西時，會讓它完全消失。你知道這代表了什麼嗎？”你聽過許多關於這些事件的猜測，但你鼓勵她說出自己的結論。“我們已知的所有事物，所有我們能見的東西，都只是牠們留下的一部分。看看巨石陣，我們不知道它的用途，也許是因為它根本不完整。可能有許多其他建物就曾經矗立在我們腳下，但我們卻永遠不會知道。”她焦慮的踱步著：“這是我一生的研究，我已經在這些事件上下了超過十年的心血了。離奇的失蹤、滅亡的文明，該死的，我甚至會說十幾種絕跡的語言。我一直以為這些事件是大拼圖中的一小片缺少的部分；但如果其實我們所知的只是一小片還沒被那些生物偷走的部分呢？”"

msgid "Quinn sighs and turns away from you. “Sorry to have wasted your time, then. You can take the Bentley back to London. It’s only a couple miles back to Amesbury. I’ll find another ride.” You try to reason with her, but she remains stoic. “If you have nothing to tell me, I have nothing to say to you, either. Please leave me be so I can continue my research in peace.”"
msgstr "奎茵嘆氣並轉身背對你。“很抱歉浪費你的時間。你可以把車開回倫敦，埃姆斯伯里不遠，我可以另找方式回去。”你試著跟她解釋，但她只是冷漠的回答：“如果你不願意坦誠，那我跟你也沒什麼好談的。請離開讓我專心進行研究。”"

msgstr "持續隱瞞基石。"

msgid "Quinn heads to the center of the bluestone ring and takes out a small contraption possessing a series of lights along its surface. It lets out several beeps, rising in frequency as she reaches the very center. “This confirms my suspicions,” she says under her breath, then shows her readings to you. “Found these same kind of readings in a lot of other places. Roanoke Island. Angkor. You get the idea.” She stands and taps the device against the palm of her hand as she scans the stone rings. “These things you mentioned in your report, these—let us presume to call them ‘extraterrestrials’—when they take something, it vanishes completely. Do you understand what this means? Everything we know, everything we can see, it’s just what’s left. Look at Stonehenge. We have no earthly clue what it is. Maybe that’s because it’s incomplete.

msgid "Suddenly, what Agent Quinn just said snaps you to attention. Quinn is an expert in long-dead languages and ancient civilizations. You ask her if she’d be willing to help you with a related matter far from Amesbury. “If it will help me get to the bottom of this, then yes,” she replies eagerly. “What can I do for you?” With bated breath, you tell her it might require her to not inform the Foundation of her next whereabouts. She takes a moment to consider the implications, then nods, resolute. You hand her the whistle Aliki gave to you and tell her that it belonged to a Coterie member who seemed to know only Latin, ancient Greek, and other languages you could not decipher. She studies it for a long while, turning it over and over in her hand. “A white raven,” she murmurs to herself. “The Greek myths tell us that ravens were the messengers of the Gods; Apollo in particular. They were once all white, but when Apollo sent one to spy on his lover, Coronis, he learned of his lover’s infidelity and scorched the raven’s wings black in anger.” You ask Agent Quinn if there is any place in the world one might associate with Apollo or his raven. “There are temples in Rome dedicated to the god Apollo,” she says. “Apollo Sosianus and Apollo Palatinus. Let me know if you head there. I’ll meet you.”"
msgstr "奎茵探員提到的某件事突然引起了你的注意，她是一個絕跡語言跟遠古文明的專家。你問她是否願意離開埃姆斯伯里，幫助你處理一個問題。她急切地回答：“如果能幫助我瞭解這一切的真相，我就願意。我可以幫你什麼忙？”你很高興，但還是先警告她，如果她想要幫忙，就必須向基石隱瞞這件事。她思考了一下這背後代表的意義後，堅決的點頭同意了。你把阿利琪給你的哨子放到她手中，告訴她這是屬於一名結社成員的東西，她似乎只會說拉丁語、古希臘語跟其他你無法辨識的語言。奎茵將哨子翻來覆去，仔細地研究它。她喃喃自語著：“白色渡鴉。希臘神話中說渡鴉曾是神的信使，尤其是阿波羅的。牠們曾經是白色的，但阿波羅派了其中一隻去監視祂的愛人——柯洛妮絲，而當渡鴉回報她的不忠時，阿波羅在盛怒之下將牠燒成了黑色。”你詢問奎茵世界上哪個地方也許會跟阿波蘿或祂的渡鴉有關聯。她說：“在羅馬有供奉阿波羅的神殿，阿波羅索西烏斯神廟跟巴拉丁諾山阿波羅神廟。你要前往之前通知我，我會在那裡跟你碰面。”"
