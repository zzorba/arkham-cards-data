"Gulls cry out as you cross the Galata Bridge: what many would call the link between the traditional city of Constantinople, and the districts of Galata, Beyoğlu, Şişli and Harbiye, where a large proportion of foreign merchants and diplomats live and work. Since you know where you are headed, and time and secrecy are of the essence, you decide against hiring a translator, and head directly to the Süleymaniye Complex, where the target of your investigation—a Ms. Ece Şahin—supposedly works.\n"
"Ms. Şahin has made a name for herself in several fields of academia, specifically in the fields of antiquity and art history. According to your intel, she works as a curator in the recently established Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, but to your surprise, your case files include a wealth of other information about Ms. Şahin, from her schooling all the way back to her early life. All of this points to one of two conclusions: either she is not in hiding like the other members of the Coterie, or she has crafted an extensive cover story.\n"
"According to your intel, Ms. Şahin has already reached out to the Foundation by way of an offer of introduction. It could be a trap, but if she truly wishes to meet, you can’t turn down such an opportunity. Thankfully, her office is not difficult to find, the door marked with her name and full title in Turkish and several other languages. You knock and she bids you to enter, which you do with much caution, eyes instinctively darting to every one of the room’s corners and hiding places.\n"
"The room is warm and richly decorated, the walls covered in beautiful tapestries and paintings of many styles ranging from hundreds of years old to very recent, and shelves filled to the brim with a variety of colorful ceramics, glassware, and old, musty texts. “Greetings,” Ms. Şahin says with a warm smile that seems to brighten the room. She is a young woman with dark tan skin, hazel eyes, and the wispy figure of one who has spent her entire life in academia. “What can I do for you?”\n"
"You inform Ms. Şahin that you received her “earlier communication” and her desire to meet with you, which she takes a moment to interpret before her eyes go wide.\n"
"“Oh! So you are—” she clears her throat and does not finish that train of thought. “I see. Then, in that case, please, sit down. We have much to discuss.”\n"
"You tell Ms. Şahin that she can start by explaining her involvement with the Coterie. Your eyes catch her shifting uncomfortably in her seat at the mention of the organization’s name.\n"
"“The Coterie is involved with a great many things all over the world, as you likely already know,” she says, choosing each word delicately, “but their—our—goals are not so different from your own. I have spent many years as a researcher for the organization, searching for the very same things your employers seek. Objects of arcane power that can be used to defend humanity from the threats we cannot see.”"

"海鷗在你走過加拉塔橋時在空中鳴叫，這座橋梁連接了君士坦丁堡的舊城區與加拉塔、貝伊奧盧、希什利跟哈爾比耶這些較現代化的區域，大多數外國商人及外交人員都在這幾個區域生活與工作。你已經知道目的地，而且時間跟隱密性非常關鍵，所以你決定不雇用翻譯，逕直前往蘇萊曼尼耶清真寺，你的目標——艾潔·沙辛女士應該在那工作。\n"
"沙辛女士在數個學術領域都飽負盛名，尤其是在文物及藝術史的方面。根據你的情報，她目前在新成立的土耳其及伊斯蘭藝術博物館擔任館長。你很驚訝關於她的資料如此鉅細靡遺，從她求學時期到她早年的生活都有記錄。這只有兩個可能性：她要不是沒有像其他結社成員一樣神秘；就是她假造了一個幾可亂真的背景。\n"
"根據報告，沙辛女士主動與基石聯絡，提供會面的機會。這可能是陷阱，但如果她是真心想會面，你不能放過這次機會。幸運的是她的辦公室不難找，門上用土耳其文及其他語言寫著她的完整職稱。你敲門並聽到她說請進，你小心翼翼推開門，眼睛下意識地瞄向房間裡每個角落跟可能藏身的地方。\n"
"房間很溫暖，充滿了各種裝飾，牆上掛滿了美麗的掛毯跟畫作，從古老到現代一應俱全，架上放著五顏六色的陶罐、玻璃瓶跟發霉的書籍。“你好。”沙辛女士帶著一個足以點亮房間的笑容招呼你。她是一位深色皮膚的年輕女性，有著綠褐色的眼睛，散發出資深學者的氣質。“我可以為你做什麼？”\n"
"你告訴她你們收到她先前的“聯絡”，說她想與你們會面。當她理解過來後瞳孔隨之放大。\n"
"“哦！所以你是——”她清了清喉嚨，沒有將話說完。“我了解了，請坐。我們有很多東西要討論。”\n"
"你告訴沙辛女士可以從她與結社有何關聯開始解釋，你注意到當你提到這個組織的名稱時，她不自在的動了一下。\n"
"“結社在世界各地都有行動在進行，但這你應該已經知道了。”她小心翼翼的選擇適當的用詞。“但他們——我們的目的跟你們沒有太大不同。我擔任組織的研究員許多年，找尋著跟你們一樣的東西：那些具有法力的物件。利用它們來保護人類免於不可見的威脅。”"

"Or to control humanity, you note aloud.\n"
"Ms. Şahin sighs. “You are not wrong. But I assure you not all of us within the Coterie would use them for such purposes. There are those, like myself, who wish only to use them for the good of others.”\n"
"You ask Ms. Şahin why you should trust her, given the actions of the Coterie in other places around the world.\n"
"“Ours is not an organization with a leader or a hierarchy,” she explains. “We operate independently in furtherance of a unified goal. But some…” she swallows hard with a shudder. “Some employ methods I do not agree with. Methods which disgust and, if I am being wholly honest, terrify me.”\n"
"You still don’t know if Ms. Şahin is telling the truth, but there’s no point in not hearing her out. You ask her what the situation in Constantinople is, and why she has sought an audience with the Foundation. “Istanbul,” she corrects you. “The people of Istanbul no longer refer to this city by that name.” You make a note to yourself to refer to the city only as Istanbul from here on out. “One of the relics you have been searching for is here, in Istanbul. It is one I have been seeking for many years, a talisman bound to a powerful entity, what some might call a ‘jinni.’ Or in the traditional sense, the only kind of non-human entity with the capability to exercise free will.”\n"
"Judging from Ms. Şahin’s clinical definition, you wonder aloud if Ms. Şahin believes this to be true. “A jinni? No, I do not believe this talisman is bound to a jinni. I suspect its master is something even more powerful and inhuman. Something not of Earth at all. And the two of us are not the only ones looking for it. After the Great War and the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire, many records were thrown into chaos, but many more emerged from obscurity, including those pertaining to this talisman. The other group searching for it… the things they have done in search of this knowledge…” her face pales, and she struggles to keep her composure. “They’ll do anything to get their hands on it. Murder and torture are just tools to them. I hate to think of what sort of heinous acts these villains would commit if they managed to obtain it. And the worst part is, I believe one of my cohorts may be the one pulling the strings. I am so close to finding it, but if they find it first…”\n"
"You understand now why Ms. Şahin came to you—if one of the Coterie is behind this cult’s actions, she could not go to them with this information. Still, lingering doubt toils in your mind. “Please,” she pleads with you. “Find the talisman before this cult does. I do not wish to see what entity it is they worship. I’ll do what I can to help you if you place the talisman into my care afterward. In return, I promise never to relinquish it to the control of the other… more dangerous members of my organization. It will remain safe and tethered in my control. I cannot guarantee the same should you wield it yourself. Please, we are on the same side, I assure you.”"

"或是支配人類，你補充到。\n"
"沙辛女士嘆了口氣。“你說的沒錯。但我保證不是每個結社成員都想這樣做。有些人，包括我，只想用它們造福他人。”\n"
"你問她自己為什麼要相信她，畢竟結社成員在世界上其他地方做了那種事。\n"
"她解釋道：“我們不是一個有領袖或統治階層的組織。我們各自獨立行動，為了一個共通的目標努力。但有些人……”她冷顫著嚥下一口口水：“我不同意他們的做法。他們的手段非常噁心，而且坦白說，令我恐懼。”\n"
"你依然不知道該不該信任她，但不利用她的情報就太傻了。你詢問目前君士坦丁堡有什麼狀況，還有她為什麼要找上基石。“伊斯坦堡。”她糾正你。“這裡的人民已經不再用那個名字了。”你暗自記下這件事。“其中一樣你們搜尋的物件就在這裡，在伊斯坦堡。我已經追查它好幾年了，它是一個護符，裡面束縛著力量強大的靈體，有些人會叫祂‘精靈’。在傳說跟故事中，這是一種擁有自由意志的非人類靈體。”\n"
"她輕蔑的解釋令你感覺她不是真的相信精靈的說法。“精靈？不，我不認為這個護符裡住著精靈。我懷疑它的主人是更強大的存在，不屬於人類，甚至不屬於地球。而且不只我們兩個在找它，在大戰過後，奧斯曼帝國瓦解，許多記錄在混亂中遺失了。但有更多從塵封的文獻出現，其中就有關於護符的線索。有另一個團體在尋找它，他們以知識為名做出的事情……”她的臉色發白，努力想保持鎮定，“他們不擇手段想得到它，謀殺跟刑求對他們來說只是工具。我不願去想像他們得到它後能做出什麼更可怕的事。最糟的是，我認為有一位我的同志是幕後黑手。我就快找到它了，但如果他們搶先一步……”\n"
"你終於了解為什麼沙辛女士會找上你們了，如果這個邪教背後有結社成員在操控，那她就不能冒險將情報透漏給結社內的人。但你依然對她抱持著懷疑。她請求你：“拜託，搶在他們之前找到護符。我會盡我所能幫助你，只要你答應將護符置於我的保護下。作為回報，我保證絕不會將它交給組織裡其他……危險的成員中。我能維持護符的穩定，但如果你自己掌控的話，我不敢保證你能做到。拜託，我們是站在同一邊的，我發誓。”"

"You ask Ms. Şahin where you should begin searching. “The last written account of the talisman’s existence was during the city’s conquest in the 15th century. It was likely hidden in order to keep the invading Ottomans from finding it. After that, it remained hidden for many long years. It was naught but a fable, spoken of in hushed voices and whispers. But due to recent events… well, it would not surprise me if the recent Allied occupation of the city had something to do with this sudden interest in finding it.

msgid "Ece trusts the cell."
msgstr "贏得艾潔的信任。"

msgid "Ece does not trust the cell."
msgstr "失去艾潔的信任。"

msgid "Once you and Ece are safely out of the city, you seal the talisman back in its case, speaking the proper words to contain its power. As you do, the uncanny eclipse looming over the city comes to a swift end."
msgstr "當你跟艾潔安全逃離城市後，你立刻將護符放回盒子中封存，念出正確的咒語來抑制它的力量，天空中異常的日蝕很快的消散了。"

msgid "You take a moment to look out over the sea and appreciate the beauty in the gentle waves, glimmering with the reflection of the now-shining sun. As you leave Istanbul behind, you allow yourself a bit of hope. Perhaps you could have trusted Ece more, but… you shake your head, filled with grim resolve. No—this relic is something you must protect yourself. Someone else might use it for ill. At least in your hands, you know it’s safe."
msgstr "海面在歸來的陽光照射下閃閃發光，你花了片刻時間欣賞美麗的海洋與海浪。你終於成功離開伊斯坦堡，心中燃起一絲希望。也許你該多信任艾潔一點的，但是……抱著沉重的決心，你搖了搖頭。不，這個物件必須由你自己保護。其他人可能會利用它從事邪惡的目的，至少在你手裡你能確定它是安全的。"

msgid "Ece breathes an unsure sigh, worry still etched in her expression. “Well, in case they saw me, I should probably leave Istanbul for a short while. I’ll have to put in a leave of absence at the museum. In the meantime…” she turns to face you, eyebrows raised. “As for our agreement…?”"
msgstr "艾潔似乎還沒鬆懈下來，她的表情寫著擔憂。“他們也許會認出我，看來我最好暫時離開伊斯坦堡，我得通知博物館我將缺席一陣子。現在……”她轉身面向你，挑起眉毛問道：“關於我們的協議……？”"

msgid "You hand over the talisman, trusting that Ece will keep it safe in her possession as promised. She breathes a sigh of relief as she stores it safely in her side pack. “Thank you. For trusting me,” she says. “I’ll keep it on my person at all times.” You take a moment to look out over the sea and appreciate the beauty in the gentle waves, glimmering with the reflection of the now-shining sun. Finally, you ask Ece where she will go now that her position in Istanbul is compromised. “There is a place where the Coterie meets in secret. To go over… important happenings. We do not consort often, but I believe these events warrant a caucus. I will have to call the rest to assemble.” She sneaks a furtive glance in your direction. “Perhaps, when that times comes, we will meet again.” As you leave Istanbul behind, you allow yourself a bit of hope."
msgstr "你交出護符，相信艾潔會保護好它，就像她承諾過的那樣。她鬆了口氣，將護符收進背包裡。“謝謝你信任我。我會無時無刻帶著它。”海面在歸來的陽光照射下閃閃發光，你花了片刻時間欣賞美麗的海洋與海浪。終於，你問艾潔既然無法回到伊斯坦堡，她準備去哪裡。她回答：“有一個結社秘密集會的場所，我們會在那裡討論……重要的議題。我們不常聚會，但我認為最近的事件必須召開會議進行討論，我會連絡其他人來集合。”她偷偷看了你一眼後說：“也許，當時機到來，我們會再見面。”當你終於成功離開伊斯坦堡時，心中燃起一絲希望。"

msgid "You lock eyes with Ece and apologize, explaining that you cannot give it to her. Especially after seeing the havoc it could wreak when unsealed. Her expression sours into cold anger. “I see.” She narrows her eyes. “…you had no intention of ever giving it to me,” she guesses correctly. You try to explain, but she stops you. “No, I understand. Really, I do.” She takes a step back, her posture wary, defensive. “You’re just like the others. You’ll do anything to get your hands on the Keys, won’t you?” You protest—it’s not that you want them for yourself, it’s just that you need to keep watch over them. In your possession, they’ll be safe, and only ever used to protect humanity. “And what do you suppose the rest of them say?” She barks. “Tzu? Amaranth? Álvarez? The very same. ‘It’s for the good of humanity,’ they claim, and to that end, all means are justified.” She turns and departs, her final words lingering in the air: “You would fit in nicely with the Coterie.” As you leave Istanbul behind, you reflect on your decision, turning the sealed case over and over in your hands. You know it was the right thing to do, but still, Ece’s words haunt you. Perhaps you’ll be able to reconcile some other time… if she’ll even hear you out."
msgstr "你帶著抱歉的目光看著艾潔，解釋你不能將護符交給她，尤其是在看到它解除封印後能帶來什麼災難。她的臉色變的難看，充滿冷冽的憤怒。她瞇起眼說：“我懂了，你從一開始就沒打算交給我。”她猜中了，你試著解釋，但被她打斷。“不，我了解，真的。”她滿懷戒備的向後退，“你就跟他們一樣，不擇手段就只為得到密鑰對吧？”你抗議，你不是為了自己，只是為了保護它們。它們在你的看顧下會很安全，甚至能用來保護人類。“你以為他們不是這樣說的嗎？”艾潔吼到，“梓？永生花？阿瓦雷茲？他們都這樣說，‘為了全人類的利益’，然後為此不擇手段。”她轉身離開留下最後一句話：“你跟結社會很合得來的。”當你終於離開伊斯坦堡，你不斷翻轉著封印的盒子，反思著你的決定。你知道自己是正確的，但艾潔的話在你心中盤旋不去。也許某天你們能夠和解……如果她還願意聽你說話的話。"

msgid "You managed to find the location of the talisman, but the cult was one step ahead of you, swooping in and snatching it for themselves. Before you knew it, they had escaped the city with the entity unsealed. Who knows what horrors they’ve unleashed upon the world. You hope that some day the Foundation may be able to recover the talisman and prevent whatever entity it binds from causing too much harm, but until then… you shudder and put such thoughts away for the time being. If Ece was right about one of her cohorts being behind this cult’s actions, you’ll surely see the talisman again."
msgstr "你終於找到了護符的所在，但邪教成員搶先你抵達將其帶走了。在你發覺前，他們已經解除了其中靈體的封印並離開了城市，沒人知道他們釋放了什麼恐怖的存在到這世界上。你希望基石能在護符中的靈體造成重大破壞前取回護符。但現在你讓自己暫時不去思考這件事，如果像艾潔說的，有結社成員在幕後操縱，那你一定會再見到這個護符。"
