"You and Flint meet at the Royal Selangor Club: a sharp-angled complex situated on the edge of a meticulously groomed lawn. A cricket match unfolds for the club members on the turf below as you and Flint discuss the Coterie’s interests and Tzu San Niang’s possible aims. “Hold on a moment,” Flint stops mid-sip and stares into the throng of wealthy expatriates. You turn your head and watch the crowd. A woman with a pale complexion and jet-black hair turns away from you, twirling a bright red parasol.\n"
"“Well, that was easy,” laughs Flint. You can hear a steely edge in his voice as he stands, gingerly, and leaves a generous tip for the staff. “Let’s see what she’s up to, shall we?”"

"你與弗林特在皇家雪蘭莪俱樂部碰面，這座尖頂建築旁有一大片精心維護的草地。當你與弗林特正在討論梓三娘可能的目標時，一場俱樂部會員間的板球賽正在下方的草坪上進行。“等等。”弗林特停下舉到嘴邊的杯子突然看向一群富有的外國人，你轉頭也看向人群，剛好看見一名有著白皙皮膚，留著烏黑長髮的女子轉身，旋轉著手中鮮紅色的陽傘。\n"
"“好吧，得來全不費工夫。”弗林特笑了出來。他謹慎的站起身，留下一筆慷慨的小費。“走吧，我們去看看她想搞什麼鬼。”你從他的聲音中聽到了堅毅的決心。"

"You arrive in Kuala Lumpur filled with a gnawing, terrible fear. As you negotiate the fare to the railway station, your sense of foreboding only grows. The air is full of intoxicating, overwhelming scents: juicy grilled meats, chewed betel nut, wisps of incense. All of it fills your senses and reminds you how far you are from home. After your driver drops you off at the bustling railway station, you wander the platforms and rail offices, but all your inquiries are met with blank indifference.\n"
"Amidst the steam of a retreating train, you see a brilliant red parasol held by a beautiful woman with jet black hair. You barely have time to react before she melts into the bustle, but you have to wonder: is this an unlikely coincidence, or a Coterie trap? Either way, it’s the only lead you have."

"你抱著忐忑不安的心情抵達了吉隆坡。當你在與司機討價還價的同時，不祥的預感越來越強。空氣中醉人的氣味將你包圍：烤肉的香味、嚼過的檳榔、縈繞的焚香。衝擊著你的感官，再再提醒你自己離家有多遠。你在繁忙火車站下車後，在月台與鐵路辦公處之間遊蕩，但你詢問的所有人都懷著蒼白的冷漠。\n"
"突然，在離站火車噴出的煙霧間，你看見一把鮮紅色的陽傘，拿著它的人是一名美麗的黑髮女子。在她消失在熙攘的人群間前你差點來不及反應過來。但你不禁懷疑：這是個離奇的巧合；還是結社設下的陷阱？但不管怎樣，這是你唯一的線索。"

"Before you even step inside the shop, you are greeted by the intense but pleasant fragrance of dried flowers and herbs that hang in bundles from the low ceiling. The scent is intoxicating. As your eyes adjust to the dimly lit interior, a small middle-aged Malay woman in an ornate dress rises from her stool in the corner to greet you.\n"
"“You’re a bit late, but I suppose it’s better than if you had arrived early,” she says matter-of-factly. You ask her what she means, and she shakes her head. “I’m Melati. Our meeting was foretold.” She explains that she is a bomoh, or shaman, and that she was forewarned of your meeting by the spirits. You ask her about the woman with the red parasol.\n"
"“Yes, that’s why I was glad you didn’t arrive early,” she grimaces, then lights a bundle of some aromatic herbs. You feel a tingling lightheadedness wash over you, followed by soothing calm. Melati goes on: “That was Tzu San Niang. She’s the reason I have to cleanse my shop. There is a foul essence that follows her. Perhaps why she masks her unclean spirit with a veneer of politeness.” As Melati speaks, a cloud of vague confusion passes over her, as if she cannot place something. You ask her what Ms. Tzu wanted.\n"
"“I truly can’t even remember what she asked of me.”"

"踏進店鋪前你已經聞到一股強烈的藥味，無數乾燥的花束與藥草懸掛在天花板上，味道宜人。當你的眼睛適應昏暗的燈光後，你看見一名矮小的中年女子，她穿著裝飾繁雜的連身裙，從角落的凳子起身迎接你。\n"
"“你有一點來晚了，但我想比你早到要好一點。”她用理所當然的口吻說。你問她是什麼意思，但她只是搖搖頭。“我叫梅拉蒂，我預見過這場會面。”她解釋自己是一名波霍姆，或叫做薩滿。而她被魂靈告知你與她將有一次會面。你詢問她關於紅傘女子的事。\n"
"“對，這就是我很高興你沒有早來的原因。”她做了個鬼臉，然後點燃一束藥草，你感到一陣強烈的暈眩感，但暈眩過去後馬上變成了一陣舒暢的平靜。梅拉蒂繼續說：“她叫梓三娘，有個邪穢的東西跟著她，這就是為什麼我要淨化我的店。也許她的溫柔婉約就是要用來掩飾那個不潔的魂靈。”當梅拉蒂講話的同時，臉上閃過一絲模糊的遲疑，好像她無法想起某事一樣。你問她梓三娘想要什麼。\n"
"“我真的不記得她想從我這裡得到什麼了。”"

"The bomoh recites a low, mumbling chant as she completes the cleansing ritual, then holds one hand to her temple. Her brow furrows as she falls to her knees, wracked with pain. You move to help her up, and she holds one hand out, steadying herself against the low wooden table, and then slides to sit. She gestures for you to sit across from her.\n"
"“Now I understand why they told me you were coming,” she smiles bravely. The deep lines in her face fold with shadows in the dim shop. The bomoh pours you a cup of hot, steaming tea. “The spirits are restless. Something has stirred up a deep well of pain as the city reforms itself to keep up with such change. People coming and going. And in all of it, I sense a dark aura: a cloud of misfortune. And at the center of it, the lady with the red parasol. She is a harbinger of sorts. Inflicting pain and misery even as she reaps the rewards of great industry.”\n"
"The bomoh’s voice is firm and clear, even as her hands shake, holding her tea cup. You sip the rich, earthy brew as you consider the situation. Tzu San Niang has some greater design at work, but what? You ask Melati if the spirits have told her anything else. She shakes her head.\n"
"“I sense only their great pain. And that their great pain is linked, in some way, to the lady with the red parasol. It is almost as though she feeds on it. Devours it.”"

"薩滿低聲吟誦一段禱文，完成了淨化儀式。然後她突然按住太陽穴，眉頭一皺跌在地上，痛苦的顫抖著。你走上前將她扶起，讓她靠在低矮的木桌上，將她扶進座位，她揮手示意你在對面入座。\n"
"“現在我懂為什麼祂們要宣告你會來了。”她堅強的微笑，昏暗的燈光在她臉上深刻的線條留下陰影。薩滿幫你倒了一杯熱氣騰騰的茶，然後說道：“魂靈們在躁動。某種存在攪動了痛苦的深淵，城市也隨之開始產生變化。在這之中，我感應到一股黑暗的靈氣，一團由不幸組成的陰雲。而一切的中心就是那個拿著鮮紅陽傘的女子，她是毀滅的預兆，她收割著各大產業的利潤，同時造成無數的痛苦與悲傷。”\n"
"即使她握著茶杯的手顫抖不止，但她的語氣堅定而清晰。你啜了一口充滿大地香氣的茶，邊分析著情況。梓三娘正在進行一個大計畫，但是什麼呢？你問梅拉蒂魂靈是否有告訴她其他事情，但她搖搖頭。\n"

"Melati doubles over again, clutching one hand to her chest. You move to help her as Inspector Flint produces a small med kit to administer emergency aid. The bomoh shakes her head.\n"
"“Do not worry for me. I am stronger than any spirit, though I feel they are in such deep, awful pain. The city is rife with sorrow.” She sighs and rights herself. “As I said before, our meeting was not by any chance. Perhaps if we can speak with the spirits, put them to rest, we can understand Ms. Tzu’s greater aims and, perhaps, thwart them. Can you help me?”\n"

"“I am sorry to deliver such terrible news, but his spirit is in agony. He spoke of Ms. Tzu and her cruelty. Even now, she drinks his despair, feeds on it, as you or I consume food. I think I understand now.” She pauses, takes a sip of her tea, and looks gravely at you. “Ms. Tzu consumes the agony of the departed. Feeds on it. The city is rife with sorrow.
