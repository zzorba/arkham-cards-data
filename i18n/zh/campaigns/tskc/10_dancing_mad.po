"As it turns out, finding the Red Coterie operating out of Havana is the easiest part of your trip to Cuba. According to your intel, Mr. Álvarez can often be seen spending his nights at Café Luna—a hot spot among the locals and American tourists looking to escape the iron jaws of Prohibition. Open at nearly all hours of the night and serving a variety of liquors that would make even the most seasoned bootlegger’s eyes bulge, the bar has become one of the most popular in all of Havana.\n"
"You arrive at peak hours, hoping to use the crowd to blend in. For all you know, Mr. Álvarez may have been warned of your approach. As soon as you arrive, you are greeted by an array of bright lights and a crowd almost too thick to squeeze past. Live jazz resounds from within the club, and many are dancing and reveling—some before they even get inside. A bouncer in a black pinstripe suit greets you at the door, giving you the once-over but not bothering to pat you down, ask for a password, or any of the usual hoops you might have to jump through back in the speakeasies hidden throughout the States.\n"
"Once inside, you head straight for the bartender and struggle to get his attention. You order a drink as a cover, but his expression changes the moment you say that you’re looking for a Mr. Desiderio Álvarez. Eyes narrow with suspicion, he nonetheless nods in the direction of a roped-off hallway in the back corner of the room, guarded by two more suits. Both of them flank you as you approach, and follow you into what you can only assume to be the club’s VIP section. There, in a dim, smoky back room, sits none other than the “man in the blood-soaked suit,” so named for the red accents adorning his otherwise black suit—or perhaps it is simply a metaphor. He inhales slowly from a cigarette hanging loosely from his lips as he appraises you. Across from him sit two others, an elderly Cuban gent in a red suit vest, puffing on a thick cigar, and a dangerous-looking woman in a red dress who sips from a martini glass. All three of them have murder in their eyes.\n"
"“Who are these idiotas?” Mr. Álvarez asks one of the guards escorting you.\n"
"“They asked to speak with you, Desi,” the man stammers.\n"
"“Oh. Well, pour ‘em something hard, will you? Don’t just stand there.” After a quick nod, your escort jaunts out of the room, leaving you with the three apparent Coterie agents. “Come, sit.” You politely turn down a variety of smokes and take a seat at the table. “So you were looking for me?”\n"
"You nod and inform Mr. Álvarez that he is a person of interest in your investigation, that you knew he often frequented this very bar, and that you were hoping to simply ask him a few questions. Without hesitation, the woman in red pulls a long knife from out of seemingly nowhere. But the man in the suit holds out his hand, and she slides the blade back into her garter belt, covering it with the fabric of her dress."

"找尋緋紅結社在哈瓦那的蹤跡是你這趟古巴之旅中最簡單的部分。根據情報，阿瓦雷茲先生通常把夜晚都花在月下咖啡廳，一間同時受到當地人及旅客歡迎的酒吧，在這裡美國人可以暫時逃離國家禁酒令的箝制。這間酒吧幾乎徹夜營業，這裡提供的各式美酒即使最老道的酒客都無法保持清醒，因此這間酒吧成為哈瓦那最熱門的景點之一。\n"
"你在尖峰時刻抵達酒吧，希望能混入人群中。你猜測阿瓦雷茲先生已經知道你的到來。炫目的燈光與擁擠到不可能穿越的人群迎接你的到來，夜總會中傳出爵士樂團的演奏，許多人甚至還沒進入店內就已經開始跳舞狂歡。一名穿著條紋西裝的接待員招呼你，他草草的看你一眼後就讓你進入了，沒有搜身、沒有暗號，也沒有在美國私酒館常見的那些刁難。\n"
"走進店內後你逕直走向吧檯，試著引起酒保的注意。你隨便點了一杯飲料作為搭話的藉口，但酒保聽到你想找德西德里奥·阿瓦雷茲先生時臉色大變。他的眼睛懷疑的瞇了起來，他朝著房間黑暗角落的一道走廊示意，走廊前被繩子擋住，旁邊還有兩名穿著西裝的人守衛著。他們在你朝著應該是VIP區的地方走時跟在你後方。在一個昏暗、煙霧瀰漫的包間中坐著“血紅西裝”本人，也許是得名於他黑西裝上的紅色配件，也可能是暗示他從事的工作內容。他邊緩緩著吸著唇邊的香菸邊打量著你。有兩個人坐在他對面，一位是穿著紅色西裝背心的年長古巴紳士，正抽著巨大的雪茄；另一位身著紅色禮服、外表危險的女子正小口啜飲著馬丁尼。他們三人眼中都散發著殺意。\n"
"“這個白癡是誰？”阿瓦雷茲先生質問其中一名守衛。\n"
"守衛結巴著回答：“他說想見您，德西。”\n"
"“這樣啊，那去幫他倒杯喝的來吧，不要只會站在那。”守衛快速的點頭回應後就離開了房間，留下你與三名結社成員。“請坐。“你禮貌地拒絕了香菸並在桌邊坐下。“所以，你在找我？”\n"
"你點頭並告訴阿瓦雷茲先生他是你調查中的關鍵人物，你得知他經常會出現在這間酒吧，你只是想詢問他幾個簡單的問題。聽到這裡，那名女子毫不猶豫的憑空抽出一把長刀對著你，但阿瓦雷茲示意她停手，那名女子隨即將刀收回隱藏在禮服下的腰帶。"

"Desi sighs and opens up to you, much to the chagrin of his two companions, who look on with surprise. “Something’s been after my crew in Havana. Started with some new blood who went off-grid all of a sudden. Then a couple longtimers. Just gone,” he says with a snap of his fingers. “At first, I thought it was just some uppity rivals looking to expand their territory. Fools who don’t know who I really am. The kinda scum who’d run this city into the ground.” He ashes his cigarette, staring into the ashes like there is some greater meaning inside to sift through. “Weird part is, I don’t remember their names. Nobody does. Sounds weird, right? I never forget a name. Never.” His gaze locks with yours, cold as stone. “Now I’m starting to suspect something worse. The kinda thing your people deal with.”\n"
"You wonder aloud if this is the kind of thing his people are also supposed to be dealing with.\n"
"“Don’t lump me in with the rest of them,” he chides. “I’ve got other fish on my menu. Now—you got two choices. You either help me out with my little problem, or me and my buddies here throw you to the curb. Which is it gonna be?”\n"
"After a moment of thought, you tell Desi that you’ll help if he gives you the location of any known Keys and relinquishes any he might have in his possession. The other two Coterie agents lock eyes with Desi in vain, but he has already made up his mind.\n"
"He extends his hand. “Deal. But I want in. We’ll do this together. Nobody messes with my crew and gets away with it. Come back here tomorrow night—same time, same place.” You nod and depart, booking a room at the Plaza Hotel in Old Havana and getting some much-needed rest before tomorrow’s investigation."

But now…” He shakes his head, forehead wrinkled with worry. “I don’t remember who they were. Nobody does. And it’s more of ‘em every day.

Confirming your suspicions, the door opens without any trouble, and you head inside.\n"

Old condemned cigar factory. You can’t miss it. Got at least one of those things you’re after stored inside. Just give it a week or two before they get the message about the new passphrase.
