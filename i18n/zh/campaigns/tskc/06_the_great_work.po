msgid "The brilliant sandy beaches and azure water dazzle your senses as you arrive in Bermuda proper. Rows of brightly painted homes add to the eye-popping landscape as you travel from one corner of Bermuda island to the other, asking locals for any possible leads on Coterie activity."
msgstr "你踏上百慕達的土地時，閃閃發亮的沙灘和蔚藍的海水讓你目不轉睛，走過島上時看見許多鮮豔的民居跟壯觀的天然景觀。你四處詢問當地人關於結社的行蹤。"

msgid "After mentioning Tuwile Masai by name, you are directed to a residence just past the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse on the southern end of the island. The directions lead you to a lavish bungalow with a well-kept garden overlooking the ocean. Keeping your guard up, you walk to the screen door of the house and knock. A familiar figure wearing loose slacks and a maroon linen shirt opens the door."
msgstr "提到圖維勒·馬賽的名字後，你被指引到島的南邊，吉布斯山燈塔附近的一座豪華平房，屋子前有一片精心照料的花園眺望著大海。你提高警覺，敲了敲前門，一個身穿寬鬆長褲跟紅褐色亞麻上衣的熟悉身影來到門前。"

"“If you have come to dispose of me, please make it quick,” Masai says coldly. He stands on the other side of the screen door, sweat beading on his dark skin, as he locks eyes with you. You try to explain yourself as best you can, but you can see from Masai’s body language and tone that he is set against you. After a chilly exchange, he steps onto the porch.\n"
"“Say what you will, but it is clear to me that you are interested in only one thing: power. If Commissioner Taylor had half her wits about her, she should treat you with the same fear as she treats me and my colleagues. None of you understand. None of you understand the great work we must do, as brethren, in order to live freely. One can only control the power of a Key so long before they themselves are controlled.”\n"
"Masai scoffs and takes off his large red spectacles. “You are no better than the worst of us.” He follows your gaze and holds up the spectacles. “These are of no significance. I learned too late of the dangers of holding such power myself. Now leave me in peace.”"

"“如果你是來解決我的，請你動作俐落一點。”他冷冷的說。馬賽站在門的另一邊，汗水從他黝黑的皮膚滴落，視線緊盯著你。你試著解釋，但他的肢體語言跟語氣一再透露出他對抗你的決心。經過一段冰冷的溝通，他終於願意走到門廊上。\n"
"“隨便你怎麼說，但我看得很清楚，你只想要一樣東西：力量。如果調查官泰勒有傳聞中的一半聰明，她就應該像敵視我跟我的同志一樣敵視你。你們都不了解，你們沒有一個人了解我們遠大的目標，每個人都能像手足兄弟一般自由的生活。那些控制密鑰的人，最後都無法免於反過來被它控制。”\n"
"馬賽輕蔑地拿下紅色的厚框眼鏡說：“你跟我們之中最糟糕的成員沒什麼兩樣。”他感覺到你看著眼鏡的視線，他拿起眼鏡說：“這個沒有任何力量，我只後悔自己沒早點發現掌握力量會有多危險。現在，請你離開。”"

"“You are either very persistent or very foolish,” Masai smiles. He steps out onto the porch and looks you up and down, as if sizing you up, then nods for you to follow as he walks out to the white-sanded beach. The waves lap hungrily at the shoreline as you walk alongside him.\n"
"“I apologize for my rudeness earlier. I couldn’t be certain of your intentions. And there have been a few… incidents lately,” Masai says gravely. A thick log of smooth driftwood lies buried in the sand in front of you, covered in a swarm of bright red-and-blue crabs. You ask about the incidents.\n"
"“A number of unannounced visits. The Foundation, obviously. Several days before your arrival at Lake Victoria, another member of my organization appeared at our camp, very interested in the key we had recovered. The one with the red gloves.” The professor stops, looking out at the rolling tide. “It bears explanation, I suppose. My survey of Lake Victoria turned up a number of alarming reports. The lakebed is covered in the ruins of a prehistoric city. We registered an alarming amount of carbon dioxide and strange changes in the local flora and fauna around the lake. At its source, we found a machine of alien design. Its purpose and facility are still a mystery, but whatever it was: it was running. Still is.”\n"
"Masai wipes his red spectacles with a handkerchief. “All that to say: several days before you arrived, I found that man sitting in front of the machine, hat off, staring at it. He was humming—well, that’s not quite right—he was communing with it.”\n"
"A shaft of cloud splits the sunlight overhead, casting the beach in dappled shadows. Masai’s voice breaks the silence. “In truth, I did not care to understand why. Why that man does anything has always been a mystery to me. But there was something other about his demeanor. Something altogether wrong.” Masai breathes deeply as the cloud passes, and warm sunlight overtakes the beach. “So imagine my suspicion when even more as yet unknown Foundation operatives showed up at my survey to interrupt my great work.”\n"
"You ask Masai about this “great work.” He leads you to turn around and begin walking back to his bungalow.\n"
"“It is the work of every person. What is it to be human except to live and help others in this great and perilous world? It’s harder than you might think.” He breathes deep. “If I can leave the world a bit better than I entered it, my work will be done. That is all. It is why the acquisition and squabbling over these Keys is such misdirection. One can only control a Key’s power so long before they become controlled.”\n"
"“But I sense a similar purpose in you,” Masai says. “I will not tell my colleagues we had this conversation, or what I have done with that infernal machine. The Key is yours, until you decide that it should not be. Keep it away from the man with the red gloves at any cost.”"

"“你要不是意志很堅定，要不就是笨蛋。”馬賽微笑著說。他走出門廊，上下打量著你，然後點頭示意你跟著他。你們散步的同時，一陣陣海浪拍打在白色沙灘的上。\n"
"“我為我先前粗魯的行為道歉，我不確定你的意圖。而近期又發生了一些……意料之外的事。”馬賽沉重地說。一大塊漂流木半掩埋在沙灘上，一群紅藍相間的螃蟹在上面爬來爬去。你詢問他發生了什麼事。\n"
"“許多意料之外的訪客，不用說，都是基石的人。而在你到達維多利亞湖的前幾天，一名結社的成員，也出現在我們的營地前，對我們發現的密鑰非常有興趣。就是戴著紅手套的那位。”教授暫停了一下，看著翻捲的海浪。“我認為這值得探究。我對維多利亞湖的調查有許多怪異的報告。那座湖底埋著遠古的遺跡。我們觀測到不明的大量二氧化碳跟周遭動植物不正常的變化。在這一切的源頭，我們找到了一個看起來像外星設計的機器。它的目的跟功能依然是個謎，但不管它是什麼，它持續在運作，就連現在也是。”\n"
"馬賽用手帕擦了擦他的紅色眼鏡。“在你抵達的幾天前，我發現那個人坐在機械前，脫下帽子盯著它。他在喃喃自語——這樣講不精確，他是在跟它溝通。”\n"
"一朵雲突然遮斷了陽光，在沙灘下投下陰影。馬賽在片刻的寂靜後說：“事實上，我不在乎他為什麼這樣做，那個人做的所有事對我來說都很神秘。但他的行為透露出其他東西，一種完全不對勁的感覺。”烏雲飄過，沙灘重新沐浴在溫暖的陽光下，馬賽深吸了一口氣說：“而過沒多久，一個不知名的基石探員就出現打斷我的調查與遠大目標時，你可以想像我有多防備。”\n"
"你詢問馬薩關於這個所謂的“遠大目標”是什麼。他轉身領著你走回他的平房。\n"
"“這是屬於每一個人的事業，如果人類在這個偉大但危險的世界不互相幫助的話，要怎麼存活下來呢？但這比你想像的更困難。”他深吸一口氣：“如果我在離開這個世界時，能讓它變得比我來時更好一些，那我的工作就完成了，就只是這樣。那些所有跟密鑰有關的爭奪與爭論都只是誤導罷了，那些控制密鑰的人，最後都無法免於反過來被它控制。”\n"
"“我在你的身上感覺到了跟我一樣的目標。”馬賽說。“我不會跟我的同志們提起這段對話，或是我怎麼處理那個地獄機械。密鑰是你的了，直到你選擇放棄它。請不計代價保護它，別讓它落入紅手套手中。”"

"You are almost relieved that your questioning goes nowhere; the lack of Coterie activity in Bermuda gives you an unlikely chance to rest and recuperate. For just a moment, you need only to concern yourself with the peaceful stillness of the island.\n"
"With several days remaining until your next departure, you follow the recommendation of the concierge at your hotel and take the time to explore the Crystal Caves up near the northern end of the island. Your guide is missing an arm; they illuminate dancing patterns in the darkness with their flashlight as they tell you the story of how the caves were found. You ask them how they lost their arm. “I served in the Great War,” they tell you. “Sometimes peace comes at great cost.”"

"你幾乎對於毫無收穫的結果感到鬆了一口氣。百慕達似乎沒有結社活動的痕跡，這給了你意料之外的休息時間。你終於可以喘口氣，只需要擔心如何享受島上的寧靜氣氛。\n"
"既然離你的出發時間還有幾天，你決定聽從旅館侍者的建議，到小島北邊的水晶洞窟探險。你的嚮導是一位獨臂男子，他在黑暗中用手電筒的光線織出一個個舞動的圖案，同時述說祖先如何發現這個洞穴的傳說故事。你詢問他如何失去手臂的。“我參與過世界大戰。”他回答。“有時候和平要付出巨大的代價。”"
