"It takes many hours for your steeds to reach their destination. You dare not try to wriggle free, for the fall would surely kill you. Besides, this may be your only chance to find Kadath. The creatures pass under archways of woven shadow, over cerulean seas that glimmer in the moonlight, and through vast swaths of dense mist. Eventually, you reach a continent far to the north, where even your intrepid captain never ventured. Colossal creatures dwell in the deep, dark ocean—a terrible danger to any ship that dares the dreadful seas.\n"
"Your steeds fly over a desolate landscape of ice and snow before landing. In the distance, through a haze of snow, you barely make out the shape of a domed building. One of the winged creatures points in the direction of the foreboding ruin, silently commanding you to proceed. The rest stand silently behind you with perfect patience, guarding against your escape, though you have no intention of fleeing. You will find and scale the peaks of unknown Kadath, or you will die trying."

"馱著你們的生物花了好幾個小時才到達目的地。你不敢掙扎，因為掉下去必死無疑。而且，這趟旅程或許是你唯一能找到卡達斯的機會了。它們飛過月光下閃爍的蔚藍海洋，穿過大片濃霧，飛入暗影交織而成的拱門。終於，你來到了北方遙遠的大陸，即便是你無畏的船長也未曾到過這裡。棲居在黑暗深海中的生物，對於駛進可怕海域的任何船隻來說都是恐怖的危險。\n"
"你的坐騎飛過一片冰天雪地的荒涼之地後著陸。你透過迷濛的雪花遠遠望去，看到了一些幾乎無法看清輪廓的圓頂建築。一隻有翼生物指著不詳的廢墟，靜靜地命令你朝那個地方前進。它的同胞們都靜默無聲地站在你身後，耐心地防備著你逃跑，儘管你無意逃走。你將找到不為人知的卡達斯，攀登上它的山峰，或者在尋找的過程中失去自己的生命。"

"The White Ship sails effortlessly through the aether. Along the way, it passes under archways of woven shadow, over cerulean seas that glimmer in the moonlight, and through vast swaths of dense mist. Eventually, you reach a continent far to the north, where even your intrepid captain never ventured. Colossal creatures dwell in the deep, dark ocean—a terrible danger to any ship that dares the dreadful seas. The captain moors the flying ship over a desolate landscape of ice and snow. Several moonbeams emerge from the ship’s white hull, forming a gangway to the tundra below. In the distance, through a haze of snowflakes, you can barely make out the shape of a domed building. “Welcome to the accursed Plateau of Leng,” the elderly captain says with a hint of regret in his voice. “You will find no joy or peace here. Only death. Please, I must implore you once more to forsake this quest and return to fairer lands. Are you sure this is where you would like to disembark?”\n"
"You nod. The captain sighs in reply. “I see. The White Ship shall sail no more to this forsaken place, for it shakes me to my core. You are on your own from here. I bid you farewell and good luck, fellow traveler.” You cross over bright, vivid moonbeams down onto the bleak expanse below. You will find and scale the peaks of unknown Kadath, or you will die trying."

"你點點頭。船長嘆氣道：“我明白了。這片荒土使我內心動搖，因此我再也不會將白船駛來這裡。接下來，你得靠自己了。我們在此道別吧，祝你好運，同渡人。”你穿過明亮的月光，來到下方荒涼的凍土。你將找到不為人知的卡達斯，攀登上它的山峰，或者在尋找的過程中失去自己的生命。"

"Higher and higher, you scale the mountains far to the north. Pale light shines from atop a great black peak piercing the vibrant firmament, and you know that you approach the end of your quest. You spend untold hours ascending the snow-covered slopes until finally you reach the forbidden steps leading to the castle’s great hall. The castle stands astride a precipice that overlooks the entire continent and the ocean beyond. It is a majestic sight. Above, countless tenebrous towers loom, swathed in a vortex of snow and hail. You break a trail through the crusted snow before the castle, and it soon gives way to smooth, polished onyx. The biting wind quiets to a whistle. You are bathed in a prodigious darkness that fills the vast space. Soon there is nothing but the echoing of your footsteps on the onyx floor and the quiet, lonely stillness of the great hall. Though you have crossed no doorway, you realize now where you stand: inside the halls of the Great Ones. You expected to be met by guards, servants of the gods, or perhaps even those powerful beings themselves, but you are met only by loneliness and foreboding as chilling as the piercing winds outside. You continue forward until at last you reach the end of the hall. Here, flanked by smooth onyx pillars, you find…nothing.\n"

"你攀登遙遠北方的山脈，越爬越高。一座巨大的黑色山峰上方，一道白光穿透了瞬息萬變的天穹，你知道你的探尋之旅走到了盡頭。你登上白雪皚皚的山坡，花了數之不盡的時間，終於來到了通往城堡大禮堂的禁忌階梯。這座城堡佇立在懸崖峭壁之上，俯瞰整片大陸和遙遠的海洋。這派景象何等的宏偉。上方隱約可見無數黑暗的高塔，它們處在冰雪和冰雹的漩渦中心。你踏在積雪上，往城堡走去，很快腳下就變成了光滑鋥亮的黑瑪瑙。刺骨寒風的尖嘯逐漸淡去。你被充斥廣闊空間的無邊黑暗所包圍。很快，除了你踏在縞瑪瑙地面上的回聲，只剩大禮堂的安靜、寂寥。雖然你並未穿過門徑，但你知道你現在位於哪裡：夢境諸神的大禮堂。你本以為會碰見守衛或神僕，或許還能直接見到那些強大的神明，但你只感到孤獨與不祥，就像城堡以外的刺骨寒風。你繼續前行，最終你走到了大廳的盡頭。這裡兩旁是光滑的縞瑪瑙石柱，你……一無所獲。\n"

"You turn to Randolph for answers. He has been your guide through all of this madness. Surely he will know what is going on. “Finally,” he says, gazing upon the hall with wide eyes. “We have reached the halls of the Great Ones, upon whom it is unlawful for mortals to look. We knew it was forbidden, yet here we are, our quest complete.” He turns to Virgil. “Was it worth it, sir? Have you found the evidence you seek?”\n"
"Virgil takes a step back. “What are you on about, Randolph? Was this not your idea? You are the one who led us on this quest to begin with.”\n"
"Randolph smiles and places a hand on Virgil’s shoulder. “Yes, I am. But I am not Randolph Carter.” He pulls back his other arm and, before you can react, drives a razor-sharp blade of onyx through Virgil Gray’s chest. Virgil’s corpse slides to the polished floor, eyes forever frozen in tragic shock. The being that was never Randolph Carter turns toward you, its shadow shifting into myriad shapes as it stretches across the ground. “Behold!” its many voices growl. “Your just reward!”"

"你轉向倫道夫尋求答案。他在這一路的瘋狂之旅中充當你的嚮導。顯然他清楚這是怎麼一回事。“終於。”他一邊說，一邊瞪大了眼睛看著眼前的殿堂。“我們來到了凡人不可窺探的諸神的殿堂。我們知道這裡是禁忌之地，卻還是來到了這裡，我們的探尋之旅成功了。”他轉向維吉爾，“您滿意了嗎？你找到你要的證據了嗎？”\n"

"Just then, a voice behind you breaks the silence, punctuating your confusion. “Virgil Gray. You have come to see the Great Ones, upon whom it is unlawful for mortals to look.” The voice belongs to a tall, thin figure bedecked in the ornate prismatic robes of an ancient pharaoh, crowned with a golden pschent that glows faintly in the darkness. “What is it you expected to find?”\n"
"“Are you one of the gods who dwells in this castle?” Virgil asks, approaching the being. “Why is this place so dark and lonely?”\n"
"The regal figure permits an unhappy expression to flicker briefly over its countenance. “The gods you seek have fled their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in another land, a land so marvelous they have forgotten how to be gods. Will you help me right this wrong?” the figure asks. Before Virgil can reply, it pulls its arm back and drives a razorsharp blade of onyx through Virgil’s chest. His corpse slides to the polished floor, eyes forever frozen in tragic shock. The figure turns toward you, its shadow shifting into myriad shapes as it stretches across the ground. “No,” its many voices growl. “It is not enough.”"

"就在這時，你身後的一道聲音打破了沉寂，也打斷了你的困惑：“維吉爾·格雷。你已經來到了這裡，來見凡人不可窺探的夢境諸神。”這道聲音來自一個高大瘦削的人，他身著古代法老的華麗而多彩的長袍，頭戴一頂金色雙重冠，帽冠在黑暗中微微發亮。“你想要找到什麼？”\n"
"“你是居住在這座城堡的神明之一嗎？”維吉爾接近那人，問道，“這裡為什麼如此黑暗，如此孤寂？”\n"
"那位打扮尊貴的男子臉上閃過一絲不快：“你所尋找的神明已經離開了卡達斯的城堡，移居到別的地方，一個令它們忘卻了<b>為神之道</b>的奇境。你們願意幫我復原這一切嗎？”那人問道。維吉爾還沒回答，那人便掏出一柄縞瑪瑙利劍刺進了維吉爾的胸膛。維吉爾屍身徐徐滑落，躺在了光滑的地面上，悲痛而震驚的眼神也陷入定格。那人轉向你，它的影子在地面上迅速變換為萬千形態。“不。”它以各種聲音咆哮道，“這還不夠。”"
