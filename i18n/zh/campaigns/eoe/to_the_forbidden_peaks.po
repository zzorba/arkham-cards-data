"The wind howls as your party prepares for the long journey ahead. There is very little conversation. Even if you could hear each other's muffled voices through your earmuffs and scarves, what would you say? The silence of your shared terror is loud enough.\n"
"Your destination is many miles ahead of you. The jagged peaks loom far on the horizon, taunting you. You run a mental checklist of your situation…"
msgstr ""
"當你的隊伍準備遠行時，狂風呼嘯。隊伍中幾乎沒有交談聲。即使你能透過耳套和圍巾聽到其他人低沉的聲音，你會有什麼想說的嗎？你們共同恐懼的沉默已經夠響亮了。\n"
"你的目的地在前方數英里開外。鋸齒狀山峰隱約顯現在遠方的地平線上，奚落著你。你在心裡對自己的處境列了一個清單……"

msgid "Check your Campaign Log and read each passage below that corresponds to your situation."
msgstr "檢查劇本日誌，閱讀下面每一段與你處境對應的段落。"

msgid "If Eliyah Ashevak is alive and Wooden Sledge is listed under \"Supplies Recovered:\""
msgstr "如果伊里亞·阿什瓦克活著，且“已回收的補給品”下記錄著木制雪橇："

msgid "\"It is not large or sturdy enough to carry all of us,\" Eliyah explains as he hauls the last crate of supplies onto the old sledge, \"but it should be able to carry our provisions and equipment, at least.\" He makes sure the lines are taut and all of the dogs' harnesses are properly fastened before giving Anyu, at the head of the pack, a scratch behind her ears. \"Not looking forward to having to lug this thing up those mountains, but… we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. All right, girl. You ready?\" Anyu barks once. \"Yeah, I know you are.\""
msgstr "“它不夠大，也不夠結實，裝不下我們所有人。”伊里亞一邊把最後一箱補給品拖到舊雪橇上，一邊解釋說，“但至少應該能裝得下我們的預備品和裝備。”他確認了繩子已經拉緊，所有隨行犬的輓具都正確固定好了，然後理了理領頭的安雨的耳朵後面。“別指望著能把這東西拖上山，但是……船到橋頭自然直。那麼，小姑娘。準備好了嗎？”安雨叫了一聲。“很好，我就知道。”"

msgid "You groan as you heft an enormous, heavy backpack full of equipment onto your back. You're definitely not looking forward to trekking across the snow with an extra forty pounds, but there's no avoiding it. You have no idea how long you're going to be where you're headed, and you'll need everything in that backpack if you want to survive."
msgstr "你呻吟著把一個裝滿裝備又大又重的背包扛到背上。你肯定不想帶著額外的40磅重量徒步穿越雪地，但這已無法避免。你不知道要花多久才能到你要去的地方，而如果你想活下去，背包裡的一切都是必需的。"

msgid "\"Weather might look clear right now,\" Claypool explains, \"but it could turn on a dime. We'll be on ice for most of the journey, so be on the lookout for cracks. We need ice about 60 centimeters thick in order to walk across, so stay behind me at all times and I'll use this augur to make sure it's safe.\" He holds up a spiral-tipped drilling device and leads the way."
msgstr "克萊普爾解釋說：“現在天氣可能看起來很晴朗，但它可能在瞬間轉變。我們大部分時間都在冰上，所以要注意裂縫。我們需要60公分厚的冰才能走過去，所以要一直跟在我後面，我會用這個來確保安全。”他手持一個螺旋形的鑽孔裝置，一馬當先。"

msgid "You venture out when the sky looks clear, but it only takes an hour for the weather to take a sudden turn for the worse. The heavy snowfall is bad enough, but it's the ice that truly slows you down. Without Claypool to safely guide you, you have to proceed slowly and cautiously to ensure you even make it to the mountains alive."
msgstr "當天空看起來很晴朗的時候，你冒險外出，但只過了一個小時，天氣就突然變壞了。大雪已經夠糟糕的了，但真正讓你慢下來的是冰。沒有克萊普爾的安全指引，你必須緩慢小心地前進以確保你能活著到達山脈。"

"As you set out, you hear Takada singing something under her breath—just quiet enough that you can't tell what it is. One of the others, however, seems to recognize it. \"That song again,\" they say. \"Heard you singing it on the Theodosia on the way over.\"\n"
"Takada sighs. \"It is a song my father taught me. Helps me pass the time,\" she explains.\n"
"You ask if she would like to teach it to you, and she gives you the first smile you've seen from her since the trek began: \"Yes. Yes, I would.\" You spend the remainder of the journey singing and bonding together; whittling the time away."

"當你出發的時候，你聽到高田低聲唱著什麼——聲音小到你聽不出那是什麼。然而，有其他人似乎認出來了。“又是那首歌。”那人說。“來的路上聽到你在菲奥多西亞號上唱的。”\n"
"高田嘆了一口氣。“這是我父親教我的一首歌。它能幫我打發時間。”她解釋道。\n"
"你問她是否願意教你，她回你一個微笑，這是徒步旅行以來你第一次看到她笑。“行。來吧，我來教你。”在剩下的旅途中，你們一起唱歌、聚在一起，消磨時間。"

msgid "The party suffers through the cold in unbearable silence. Each footstep is as lonely as it is harrowing."
msgstr "隊伍在難以忍受的寂靜中忍受著寒冷前進。每一步都是孤獨的，也是痛苦的。"

msgid "<i>If the investigators scouted the mountain pass:</i>"
msgstr "<i>如果調查員對山口進行了偵察：</i>"

msgid "You seek out the safe pass that you and Ellsworth scouted last night, guiding the rest of the team onward. Sheer cliffs flank you as you approach the foothills, blocking the chill wind. The shortcut gives you swift passage as you begin your trek up to the peaks…"
msgstr "你找出昨晚你和埃爾斯沃思偵察時發現的那條安全通道，引導其他隊員過去。當你接近山麓時，陡峭的懸崖擋住了寒風。你開始向山頂攀登，這條捷徑讓你們進展迅速……"

msgid "During setup, when you reveal the starting location, reduce its clue value by half (rounded up)."
msgstr "冒險設置期間，在你揭示起始地點時，使其線索值減半(向上取整)。"

msgid "The frozen tundra leading up to the foothills of the jagged mountains is hard terrain to traverse. Even prepared as you are with snowshoes and warm clothes to fight the cold, the going is slow and rough. The wind fights you at every turn, its gusts strong enough to knock you over. But you continue onward, undeterred."
msgstr "通向鋸齒狀山脈的丘陵凍土帶是很難穿越的地形。即使你已經準備好了雪地鞋和保暖的衣服來禦寒，行路仍然緩慢而艱難。狂風在每一個拐角都與你搏鬥，強到足以把你吹倒。但是你依然繼續前進，毫不動搖。"

msgid ""
"You hike through the ice and snow for many grueling hours. Luckily, you encounter no more of the creatures from the previous two days, leaving you to ponder if it was all some cruel mirage. But as you draw closer to the base of the jagged snow-tipped mountains, you find another manner of creature altogether.\n"
"It lies frozen and half-buried in the snow, like a macabre waymarker guiding you onward. Its body is shaped like a drum, with thick hide and a pair of torn, leathery wings. A starfish-shaped appendage sticks out of the snow from its top half, adorned with five dead eyes and a set of prismatic cilia. Five sets of tentacles lie frozen in the ice. The sight of the thing chills you more than the Antarctic weather possibly could.\n"
"There can be no doubt: this is one of the \"Elder Things\" that Professor Dyer and Danforth encountered the last time they ventured into the heart of Antarctica. But what killed it? Surely it was not just the cold?"
msgstr ""
"你在冰雪中跋涉了好幾個小時。幸運的是，你沒有再遇到前兩天的生物，這讓你思考那是否只是某種殘酷的幻景。但當你走近鋸齒狀雪山的底部時，你發現了另一種完全不同的生物。\n"
"它被凍結著半埋在雪裡，像一個令人毛骨悚然的路標指引著你前進。它的身體形狀像鼓，有厚厚的皮和一對撕裂的皮翼。一個海星形狀的附屬器官從它的上半部分伸出雪中，長有五隻死眼和一組五顏六色的纖毛。五組觸鬚則都凍在冰裡。看到這東西，你感受到的寒意比南極的天氣更冷。\n"
"毫無疑問，這是戴爾教授和丹佛斯上次深入南極中心地帶時遇到的“古老者”之一。但是什麼殺了它呢？肯定不僅僅是因為寒冷吧？"

msgstr "這一切都發生在眨眼之間。在同伴被抓住之前，你只來得及尖叫一聲對方的名字。它千變萬化的身體纏在你同伴身上。你的同伴掙扎著想逃脫，但毫無希望。"

msgstr "如果受害者是詹姆斯·“曲奇”·弗雷德里克斯："

msgid "Then, without a moment of consideration, it shoves its tendrils into its victim's body and yanks them apart like a piece of uncooked meat. A spray of blood stains the snow crimson. It drops what remains of your companion unceremoniously onto the ground and turns its attention to you."
msgstr "然後，它毫不猶豫地把卷鬚插進受害者的身體，把後者就像一塊生肉似的當場撕碎。噴出的血把雪染成了紅色。它毫不客氣地把你同伴的殘骸扔到地上，然後把注意力轉向你。"

"The view from the summit is breathtaking, but you are in no mood to enjoy the spectacle. Sprawled before you, on the other side of these accursed peaks, lies the city described in Dyer's report. Its haunting visage is unmistakable. Dozens of conical and pyramidal buildings of dark slate and sandstone are honeycombed throughout the region like a labyrinth of perfect geometric shapes. Though weathered by the ages, the city still stands, hidden by the jagged peaks and the heavy snow.\n"

"山頂處的景色嘆為觀止，但你無心享受。在你面前，這些被詛咒的山峰彼端，是戴爾報告中描述的城市。它那令人難忘的樣子毋庸置疑。幾十座由黑色石板和砂岩建造的圓錐形和金字塔形建築像蜂巢一樣遍佈整個地區，就像一個完美的幾何形狀的迷宮。儘管歷經歲月的滄桑，這座城市依然屹立不倒，隱藏在鋸齒狀山峰和大雪之中。\n"
"有那麼一會兒，你靜靜地站在那裡，欣賞這奇妙的景象。如果不是因為一路上的諸多艱險，此刻本應是歡慶勝利之時。但在付出了這麼多犧牲之後，勝利嘗起來甚是空洞無味。\n"
"刺骨寒風吹過山峰。空氣太稀薄了，你不能在這裡過多逗留。休息片刻後，你開始長途跋涉，進入陌生的城市。在到達山腳下之前，你必須紮營。運氣好的話，住在那裡的可怕生物不會注意到你……"

"Just as you are beginning to lose hope, you find a dark cave embedded in the mountainside. The wind howls outside the cave entrance, bringing with it a sudden deluge of snow. You're not sure what would be worse—a slow death trapped inside an icy cavern, or an equally slow one failing to reach the summit. But when one of your companions switches on their flashlight, you realize there may be a third option.\n"
"The walls of this narrow tunnel are covered in strange hieroglyphs, the likes of which you've never seen. The ancient writings of an alien language, you presume. Possibly even that of the Elder Things who once called this region home. More importantly, the cavern continues deeper and deeper into the side of the mountain, far beyond the reach of your light.\n"
"You take a vote and decide to press onward, hoping beyond hope that the tunnel might take you to another exit. To your surprise, the journey is smooth, although the ever-present darkness, the frightening echoes of uncanny groans, and the muffled voices of something deep below wear upon your sanity. For hours you continue on, until finally, mercifully, you see light in the distance.\n"
"You emerge once more onto the side of the mountain, this time to a breathtaking vista. Sprawled before you lies the city described in Dyer's report. Its haunting visage is unmistakable. Dozens of conical and pyramidal buildings of dark slate and sandstone are honeycombed throughout the region like a labyrinth of perfect geometric shapes. Though weathered by the ages, the city still stands, hidden by the jagged peaks and the heavy snow.\n"
"For a while, you stand in silence and take in the wondrous sight. Somehow, you have managed to find a way through the mountain. If it weren't for the many trials you faced along the way, it would be a moment of triumph. But after the sacrifices made to get here, the victory rings hollow. After a moment's rest, you begin the long trek down into the alien city. You will have to make camp before you reach the bottom. With any luck, you'll be hidden from the dreadful creatures that dwell there…"

"正當你開始失去希望時，你在半山腰發現一座黑暗的洞穴。洞口外狂風呼嘯，一場大雪突然接踵而至。你不知道哪種情況更糟——被困在冰冷洞穴裡慢慢死去，還是在到達頂峰前同樣緩慢地死去。但當你的一個同伴打開手電筒時，你意識到可能還有第三種選擇。\n"
"這條狹窄隧道的牆壁上佈滿了你從未見過的奇怪的象形文字。你認為這是用異星語言所寫的古代作品。甚至可能就是那些曾經在這片地方安家的古老者寫的。更重要的是，洞穴通向山峰內側越來越深的地方，遠遠超出了你的光線所能照射到的範圍。\n"
"你們投票後決定繼續前進，希望隧道能把你帶到另一個出口。令你驚訝的是，旅程相當順利，除了始終存在著的黑暗，還有可怕呻吟的回聲和下面深處什麼東西那低沉的聲音在不停磨損著你的理智。幾個小時過去了，直到最後，非常幸運，你看到遠處有光。\n"
