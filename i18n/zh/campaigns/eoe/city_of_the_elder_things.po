msgid "Scenario III: City of the Elder Things"
msgstr "冒險III：古老者之城"

msgid "As you read the scenario introduction, check the Campaign Log and read any passage that corresponds to your situation."
msgstr "在閱讀冒險引言時，檢查劇本日誌，閱讀每一段與你處境對應的段落。"

msgid "Even with the knowledge afforded to you by Dyer's report, you find yourself wholly unprepared for the terrible vastness of the blasphemous city at the heart of Antarctica, and its alien inscrutability. Massive towers, temples, bridges, and pyramids dot the broad landscape. In the ineluctable light of dawn, the nameless maze of cyclopean structures and angular blocks extends for miles in every direction, unmistakably real and yet impossible to believe. It is truly a wonder of the world."
msgstr "即使你從戴爾的報告中已經得知，你還是發現自己完全沒有準備好面對南極中心的這座可怕而巨大的褻瀆之城，以及它那屬於異星的種種不可思議。巨大的塔樓、廟宇、橋樑和金字塔點綴著廣闊的風景。在遍及四處的晨光中，這座由巨大結構和稜角分明的石塊組成的無名迷宮向每個方向延伸數英里，無疑是真實的，但卻讓人難以置信。這毫無疑問是世間奇觀。"

msgid "If Dr. Mala Sinha is alive:"
msgstr "如果瑪拉·辛哈醫生活著："

msgid "\"Remember, stay covered at all times. Where we are headed, the wind can flash freeze your skin almost instantly. And stay hydrated,\" Dr. Sinha reminds you. \"The air here is dryer than you think.\" The remainder of the party nods in understanding. None of you have come this far just to catch hypothermia… but it's almost as likely as death by anything else in this damnable place."
msgstr "“記住，要始終保持隱蔽。在我們要去的地方，風幾乎能在瞬間凍結你的皮膚。還有保持水分。”辛哈醫生提醒你，“這裡的空氣比你想像的要乾燥。”團隊中的其餘人都點頭表示理解。你們都不想走了這麼遠卻死於體溫過低……但在這該死的地方，這和死於其他方式幾乎沒有分別。"

msgid "The investigators suffer no ill effects."
msgstr "調查員沒有承受任何不良效果。"

msgid "You were briefed many times on the dangers of the Antarctic environment, but without Dr. Sinha, you're at a disadvantage braving the harsh weather. What she lacked in bedside manner, she made up in expertise. Wishing you could have saved her, you grit your teeth and trudge on, watching your companions for any sign of hypothermia."
msgstr "你聽過很多次南極環境的危險，但沒有辛哈醫生，你在惡劣的天氣中非常不利。她用專業知識彌補了對病人態度的不足。你真希望自己當時能救下她，但現在只能咬緊牙關，繼續艱難前行，觀察著同伴是否有體溫過低的跡象。"

msgid "Each investigator adds a Frostbitten weakness to their deck. It does not count toward that investigator's deck size."
msgstr "每位調查員將一張凍傷弱點加入自己牌組。這張卡牌不計入該調查員的牌組卡牌張數。"

msgid "As you descend the peaks surrounding the city, trespassing furtively over its walls, the slopes give way to gradual, shallower foothills peppered with structures of black, primordial stone. Towers or outposts, perhaps, linking the natural outer walls of the city to its outskirts. \"We should search one of those watchtowers,\" one of the team members suggests, pointing to the closest structure. You nod in agreement. Dyer's report had observed a wealth of information carved into the walls of several structures within the city, after all—perhaps you'll stumble upon a map or diagram of the city to aid in your exploration."
msgstr "當你沿著環繞城市的山峰往下走，偷偷地越過城牆，斜坡被平緩的、較淺的山麓所取代，山麓上點綴著黑色原始的石制建築。這些也許是塔樓或前哨，將城市的自然外牆與市郊連接起來。“我們應該搜查其中一個瞭望塔。”一名隊員指著最近的建築建議道。你點頭贊同。戴爾的報告中提到，他觀察到在這座城市一些建築的牆壁上雕刻了大量的資訊，畢竟——也許你會在探索中偶然發現一幅地圖或城市的示意圖。"

msgid "<i>If the investigators scouted the city outskirts:</i>"
msgstr "<i>如果調查員對城市市郊進行了偵查：</i>"

msgid "Instead of heading to the watchtower, you call out to the others to follow you. Recalling the route you and Ellsworth had scouted out the night before, you lead the group toward the half-buried structure you spotted. It takes a bit longer to get there than the watchtower, but provides an easy shortcut into the city proper."
msgstr "你叫其他人跟著你，而不是前往瞭望塔。回想起你和埃爾斯沃思前一天晚上偵查的路線，你帶著隊伍走向你們發現的半埋的建築。到那兒去比瞭望塔花了更多時間，但是它提供了一條進入城市的捷徑。"

msgid "During setup, after you reveal the starting location, the lead investigator discovers clues from that location equal to half its clue value (rounded up)."
msgstr "冒險設置期間，你揭示起始地點後，調查員隊長發現該地點的線索，數量等於其線索值的一半(向上取整)。"

msgid "If Professor William Dyer is alive:"
msgstr "如果威廉·戴爾教授活著："

msgid ""
"\"Be careful,\" the professor warns. You are keen to heed his wisdom, earned as it is through hard experience. \"The glyphs inscribed here depict much about the history of this place. It is ancient. Far more ancient than anything our species has built.\"\n"
"\"What is your point?\" someone chimes in.\n"
"\"Do you know the old phrase, 'the walls have ears and the doors have eyes?'\" Dyer replies. \"We have no idea what could be hiding within these walls. What dwells under the ice and stone. Be on alert… and do not let any voices but our own rattle in your skull. Do you understand?\"\n"
"You nod in agreement, gulping down a wave of nausea. You cannot help but take the meaning of Dyer's idiom literally."
msgstr ""
"“小心。”教授警告說。你渴望聽從他的智慧，因為這是通過艱苦的經歷得來的。“刻在這裡的象形文字描述了許多這個地方的歷史。它很古老。比我們人類建造的任何東西都要古老得多。”\n"
"“你的意思是？”有人插話。\n"
"“你知道那句老話嗎，‘牆有耳，門有眼’？”戴爾回答，“我們不知道牆後藏著什麼。冰雪和石頭下住著什麼。保持警惕……除了我們的聲音，別讓其他聲音在你的腦袋裡嗡嗡作響。明白了嗎？”\n"
"你點頭贊同，強壓住一陣噁心。你不禁從字面上理解戴爾的習語。"

msgid "As you enter the tower, the cold dwindles, but the sense of unease you felt observing the city from a distance only grows. Without Dyer's wisdom to guide you through this place, you feel completely unprepared. Every drop of water, every shifting pebble, every hushed breath causes your throat to clench and your heart to race. It's not long before you hear whispering in the walls—voices that don't belong to you, or anyone in your party. The more you try to deny it, the stronger the voices become. A choir in your mind. A warning?"
msgstr "當你進入塔内，寒冷逐漸消失，但從遠處觀察這座城市時感受到的不安卻更為強烈。沒有戴爾的智慧引導，你覺得自己毫無準備。每一滴水、每一顆跳動的卵石、每一次屏住的呼吸，都讓你的喉嚨緊繃、心跳加速。過了不久你就聽到牆裡的竊竊私語——這聲音不屬於你，也不屬於你的同伴。你越不想聽，那些聲音就越強烈。在你思想中響起的合唱。是警告嗎？"

msgid "Each investigator adds a Possessed weakness to their deck. It does not count toward that investigator's deck size."
msgstr "每位調查員將一張附身弱點加入自己牌組。這張卡牌不計入該調查員牌組的卡牌張數。"

msgid ""
"The open entrance to the obsidian structure greets you like the maw of a ferocious predator. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, your curiosity gives way to deep, profound dread. The structure's sharp, angular main hall is the site of an absolute massacre. Mangled Elder Thing corpses litter the floor—piles of leathery gray flesh and sticky, misshapen organs, coated in thick, dark-green fluid. You reel at the awful stench of death. These dead are not ancient. This slaughter must have been recent.\n"
"\"What could have done this?\" One of your party breaks the immense silence. Murals on the walls draw your attention, depicting what you have come to know as the race of Elder Things embroiled in battle with some ancient, terrifying foe—no, not one. Many. Your party dares not dwell in this slaughterhouse long. Covering your noses to block the awful stench, you take your leave."
msgstr ""
"這座黑曜石建築那敞開的入口，就像兇猛的食肉動物對你張開了血盆大口。當你的眼睛適應了黑暗時，你的好奇心被深深的恐懼所取代。這座建築那稜角分明的主廳就是個屠殺現場。血肉模糊的古老者屍體散落一地——成堆的灰色皮肉和黏糊糊的畸形器官，上面塗著厚厚的墨綠色液體。屍臭讓你感到無比噁心。這些遺體並不久遠。這次屠殺一定是最近發生的。\n"
"“究竟是什麼東西做了這樣的事？”一名隊員打破了寂靜。牆上的壁畫吸引了你的注意，上面描繪的是你所知道的古老者種族捲入戰爭，對方是某個古老而可怕的敵人——不，不止一種。是許多種。你們不敢在這個屠殺現場待太久。捂住鼻子擋住惡臭，你們趕緊離開。"

msgid "If James \"Cookie\" Fredericks is alive and Dynamite is listed under \"Supplies Recovered:\""
msgstr "如果詹姆斯·“曲奇”·弗雷德里克斯活著，且“已回收的補給品”下記錄著炸藥："

msgid "Unfortunately, as you attempt to leave the structure, you find the passage blocked by ice and rubble. Just as you are considering how to dig your way through, Cookie approaches with a few sticks of dynamite bundled together. \"Oh, fer Chrissake. Move out of the way,\" he grumbles, setting the sticks up and lighting the fuse without another warning.You and the others run around the corner, covering your ears and cursing under your breath. Seconds later, a tremendous explosion shakes the building to its foundations. When the dust settles, Cookie has made an easy exit for the party. \"Sometimes, Cookie, I swear…\" someone remarks."
msgstr "不幸的是，當你試圖離開建築時，你發現通道被冰雪和碎石堵塞了。就在你正在考慮如何挖出一條路的時候，曲奇拿了幾根捆在一起的炸藥走過來。“噢，看在老天份上。閃開。”他一邊抱怨，一邊把炸藥設置好，毫無徵兆地就點燃了導火索。你和其他人連忙跑到拐角處，捂著耳朵低聲咒罵。幾秒鐘後，一場巨大的爆炸震動了整個建築。當一切塵埃落定，曲奇為團隊開了一條捷徑。“有時候，曲奇，我發誓……”有人說。"

msgid "Unfortunately, as you attempt to leave the structure, you find the passage blocked by ice and rubble. It takes much longer than you expected to find another way out, and when you finally escape, you've already been exposed to the elements for some time."

msgstr "在混亂袋裡加入1個[frost]標記。"

msgid "The trail of sickly green blood leads out and dribbles down a smooth path sculpted, as if by an acidic substance, out of the mountainside. In the opposite direction, the mountain ridge continues along the perimeter of the city. In the distance, you can just make out a darkened, half-buried section of the city, the layout of its structures completely unfamiliar to you, even after going through Dyer's notes extensively. Finally, in the heart of the city, a great pyramid and many prominent temples lie scattered, rising to amazing heights despite the weathering of many eons."
msgstr "一條噁心的綠色血跡從山腰延伸出來，沿著一條平滑的小路滴落下來，這條小路仿佛是被一種酸性物質雕刻出來的。在相反的方向，山脊繼續沿著城市的周邊延續。在遠處，你只能辨認出城市黑暗的、半被掩埋的部分，即使在仔細閱讀了戴爾的筆記之後，它的結構佈局對你來說還是完全陌生。最終，在城市的中心，一座巨大的金字塔和許多顯眼的寺廟散佈在各處，儘管歷經千萬年的風化，仍高聳入雲。"

"A quiet, unearthly stillness welcomes you as your party delves into the secret passageway. You expected to be greeted by sound and fury, but this eerie silence is almost worse. Not a word is spoken as you slink deeper and deeper into the secret shaft, making note of the peculiar smoothness of the walls, the bizarre markings along the floor, the muted drip, drip, drip of water in the distance.\n"
"For hours you continue into the deep dark, questioning your judgment with each step. What kind of people walk willingly into the jaws of such horror? You risked your reputation going on this expedition to begin with. Then you risked your life not turning back the moment things turned dire. Now you risk your very sanity unearthing secrets no human was ever meant to find.\n"
"Is this bravery? Or the final mistake of a herd of fools, too stubborn to see that their own deaths lie at the end of this road? It matters not. You've come too far to turn back now. One way or another, you will get the answers you seek. The only question is whether you'll live to tell the world what you found."

"當你的團隊潛入秘密通道時，怪異的寂靜迎接著你。你以為迎接你的是喧囂和憤怒，但這種詭異的寂靜幾乎更糟糕。當你越來越深入這個秘密豎井時，你們全都沉默不語。你注意著光滑的牆壁、地板上奇異的標記，以及遠處柔和的<b>滴答、滴答、滴答</b>的滴水聲。\n"
"你在一片漆黑中持續走了幾個小時，每一步都在質疑自己的判斷。什麼樣的人才會心甘情願地進入這樣恐怖的鬼地方啊？你賭上名譽參加這次探險。然後你賭上性命在情況變糟的時候也不肯回頭。現在你要賭上你全部的理智發現人類不該發現的秘密。\n"
"這是勇敢嗎？還是一群傻子犯下的致命錯誤，太固執以至於看不清這條路的盡頭就是自己的死亡？但這些都不重要了。你已經走了太遠，現在無法回頭了。無論如何，你都會得到你想要的答案。唯一的問題是你能否活下去，來告訴全世界你的發現。"

"Hours pass. You dare not venture outside, but you explore every crevice of your sanctuary, hoping to find something to make this endeavor worthwhile. What you find instead is even harder to believe. In the icy sub-level of the structure, a sacred chamber houses a churning pool of kaleidoscopic miasma. Gray, swirling mist evaporates from its surface Familiar shapes and strange hallucinations materializing and vanishing within.\n"
"As if sensing your approach, the pool stops whirling and rises on its own, almost as if in greeting. Then, it coalesces into a shimmering glob of prismatic color and crawls along the floor, stopping when you stop, continuing along as you follow. It beckons you closer, guiding you. You glance at one another with trepidation. Is it trying to show you something? To take you somewhere? And if so… is it truly wise to follow?\n"
"Eventually, you come to an agreement. There is no use dawdling here, and the weather grows fouler with each passing minute. You decide to follow with caution, hoping perhaps it will lead you to answers. For hours you continue into the deep dark, questioning your judgment with each step. The ancient structure gives way to icy tunnels, walls smooth and slick with dark ichor, floor covered in bizarre markings of unknowable origin. Finally, the glob of miasma seeps back into the walls and disappears, leaving you alone with your doubts, your fears, and the impossibly long shaft breaching through the icy heart of Antarctica and into the depths beyond…"

"幾個小時過去了。你不敢到外面去冒險，但你探索了避難所的每一個縫隙，希望能找到一些值得的東西。然而你的發現反而更讓人難以置信。在這座建築冰冷的底層，有一個神聖的房間，裡面充滿了千變萬化的瘴氣。旋轉的灰霧從表面蒸發，熟悉的形狀和奇怪的幻覺在裡面出現和消失。\n"
"仿佛感覺到了你的到來，那團瘴氣停止了旋轉，自己升了起來，仿佛是在打招呼。然後，它凝聚成閃爍的、五光十色的一團，沿著地板向前爬行，當你停止時它也停止，當你跟隨時它又繼續前進。它招呼你靠近，引導著你。你們驚恐地面面相覷。它是不是想告訴你什麼？想帶你去什麼地方？如果是這樣的話……跟著它真的明智嗎？\n"
"最終，你們達成了統一。在這兒磨蹭是沒有用的，天氣每分鐘都在變得更壞。你決定謹慎地跟隨，希望它能給你帶來答案。你在一片漆黑中持續走了幾個小時，每一步都在質疑自己的判斷。這座古代建築連通著冰冷隧道，牆壁被黑色膿水塗抹得平穩光滑，地板上覆蓋著來歷不明的奇異標記。最後，那一團瘴氣又滲進了牆壁，消失了，只留下你一個人，帶著你的疑惑，帶著你的恐懼，向著那不可思議的長長的豎井走去，穿過南極的冰雪中心，進入深淵彼端……"
