"As you depart the residential area, an old African man dressed in pristine white traditional attire approaches you. You do not know who he is, but you are sure you have seen him before.\n"
"\"I've been watching you since the day you first arrived,\" he states in a calm and confident voice. \"From what I've seen, I understand why our ancestors turned to you. The task ahead of you is of paramount importance. So much depends on you and the choices you will make when you face the Darkness. So I give you this.\"\n"
"The old man hands you a small and finely decorated instrument, carved out of Kudu horn.\n"
"\"When you feel the time is right, use it to call upon our ancestors. May they come to your aid swiftly.\"\n"
"As he talks to you, it is as if you were hypnotized by the artifact. You can feel its power but you don't understand its origin. You look up to question the mysterious benefactor, but the old African man in white has disappeared, as if he were never there. Only the horn in your hand proves you have not been deceived by an illusion."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your visit to the Central Station and your trip up the river have allowed you to learn more about Kurtz. You have come up with several hypotheses as to his deeper motives. Now that he stands before you, you can put your theories into practice and try to decipher the actions of this strange man."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kurtz often mentions his \"promised\" during the discussion, a woman who would be waiting for him back home. You make the connection with the photo you found in Kurtz's belongings at the Central Station, and suddenly you have an epiphany. The young woman's face looks familiar because the \"promised\" in question is in fact the daughter of Mr. Promise. You know that no one, least of all her father, knows that the daughter of your sponsor is having an affair with Kurtz. You decide to take advantage of this information to push Kurtz to leave and join her for good."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kurtz is not so easily taken aback by your knowledge of him. It will take time to find the crack in his psychological defences."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kurtz often refers to his incredible accomplishments, but regrets that he has to use force to achieve them. You take advantage of this contradiction by trying to make him face the consequences of his actions, as well as those of the Black Hand tribe. You present him with the idea that something, perhaps related to what made him sick, is spreading contagious violence."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kurtz does not easily admit his fears and doubts directly. You can tell that he is afraid of what the Company might do to him if he decides to leave their territory. He seems to fear an attack on his person on the journey back, but perhaps he will change his mind if you provide him with safe passage out of the Congo."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kurtz speaks of his respect for the mighty Congo River, and by extension for the passengers on the old steamboats that ply it from one end of the country to the other. You can see how he dreads embarking again on a dangerous journey from which he is not sure he will emerge alive."
msgstr ""

msgid "As time passes, you realise that Kurtz's health is deteriorating. His mind is increasingly foggy, his desire to leave less and less clear. A dark entity, which you can also feel more and more strongly the longer you stay here, tightens its grip on Kurtz's soul."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Harlequin heads towards the Station, crying over the loss of his book. Now that the mad Russian is gone, you can consult the book, annotated in Russian, that was hidden in your belongings. Thanks to the revelations of its former owner, you know how to read it and discover the secrets it contains."

"Your Parley with Kurtz begins like any other civilized exchange, but gradually a sort of animosity sets in. You don't understand how this happened, and despite your efforts you can't immediately find the right thing to say.\n"
"Kurtz, too, seems to be struggling with something that prevents him from opening up to you. It is as if a third party, some malicious entity, is coming between you and wants to prevent you from finding common ground."
msgstr ""

msgid "You are so good at showing off your qualities that Kurtz is impressed. If you continue like this, you may succeed in making him doubt his unrivaled omnipotence."
msgstr ""

msgid "You're not as brilliant as you thought you were, and Kurtz is confirmed in his megalomania. You'll have to find another way to impress him."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kurtz doesn't realize it, but he's actually in far more danger at the Inner Station than he is aboard the Roi des Belges. You know that his days are numbered if you fail to get him back on board the steamer, and this drives you to find the right arguments to convince him."
msgstr ""

msgid "You recount the horrors you encountered on your journey. Kurtz freezes every time you mention the name of Captain Fresleven. He seems particularly disturbed by the story told to you by the tribe responsible for the Swede's death."
msgstr ""

msgid "Kurtz points out that you, too, have a dark side that has followed you since the beginning of your journey in Africa. Perhaps you and he are the playthings of forces beyond both of you. Perhaps you are doing all this in vain."
msgstr ""

msgid "With a captain as competent as Marlow at the helm, the return trip is virtually risk-free. Kurtz is very receptive to this argument, so it won't take much more to reassure him on this matter."

"Night has long since fallen, but you can't sleep. The heat and humidity of your cabin are stifling and you decide to go out on deck to get some fresh air. The moon is full and casts a ghostly light over the riverbanks all around you. As you stroll along the deck, you hear a discussion muffled by the noise of the ship.\n"
"Before the sound was drowned out by a sudden noise from the boiler, you thought you heard the name Kurtz. You wonder who could be talking about Kurtz at this late hour."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You are awakened by a terrifying explosion. You rush out of your cabin and realize with horror that the steamer's old boiler has burst. The tragedy has injured several crew members and inflicted severe damage on the Roi des Belges. Luckily, the hull has enough integrity to keep you afloat.\n"
"You begin the repairs, when a metallic flash on the river catches your eye. You can hardly believe your eyes; a huge white ape is sitting on the opposite bank, quietly watching you while holding a large piece of the boiler that doesn't look too damaged. The strange pale creature meets your gaze and runs to hide in the forest.\n"
"You explain the situation to the Director, who leaves it to you to decide what to do next. If you go in search of this white ape, you may be able to get back the part that would greatly help the boiler repair, but it is at your own risk."

"Your stealthy approach allows you to enter a village in the middle of the night, where you witness an amazing spectacle. Men, women and children of the tribe are taking part in a nightmarish festival. Everyone shouts like beasts and moves like monsters from a forgotten time around a huge bonfire. In the center of the festivities, an altar has been erected, upon which a colonial-style helmet is displayed. After the celebrations, the tribe gathers around. A few hours later, everyone set off towards the east in a huge unholy procession.\n"
"In the early morning, you enter the village in search of clues about these strange beings. You find nothing of interest, except for a leather tag on the altar, which probably fell off the helmet when the tribe took it away. It is marked with the name of its owner: \"Kurtz\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After heavy fighting and several members of the tribe being shot, the survivors hastily retreat eastward, abandoning their belongings. While searching for clues they may have left behind, you happen to notice that one of the corpses is clutching a colonial-style helmet to his chest. The warrior was obviously trying to protect it with his life. You take hold of this unusual object, when the sudden sound of war drums coming from the east resounds. The survivors are coming back with reinforcements!\n"
"Panic-stricken, you flee this cursed place with all haste. After hours running, you are relieved to see that you have lost your pursuers. With a moment to rest, you can inspect the helmet. Inside, a leather tag is marked with the owner's name: \"Kurtz\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have found the remains of Captain Fresleven, the leader of the previous expedition to bring Kurtz back. He has been lying here for several weeks, a traditional warrior's spear stuck in his back. You assume that the station was abandoned by its inhabitants to avoid the Company's reprisals. The question is why the poor man died. You must find the tribe that occupied this station to solve this mystery."

"Against all odds, the tribe whose hideout you found welcomes you peacefully, having taken care to ensure that you mean them no harm. Their version of the events at the station is intriguing.\n"
"It all started with a clash between the chief of the tribe and Captain Fresleven, who wanted to buy some black hens before continuing his journey upriver. This quite ordinary transaction broke down when the captain, usually calm and level-headed, began to hit the old chief, shouting that the terms of the deal were not being respected. Seeing his father in danger, the chief's son rushed to his aid, killing the Swede with a spear in the back. Panic-stricken, the whole tribe fled the station, escaping the reprisals of the dead captain's crew. The chief's son became delirious a few weeks later, talking about a shadow coming to take him. He died of a strange and devastating disease shortly after.\n"
"Realizing that you will not learn any more from them, you return to the Director and tell him of your findings. Although he is unhappy to hear of Captain Fresleven's fate, he now knows what happened. He asks you to continue your journey."

"You realise that this book is not actually encrypted, but written in an almost unreadable Russian, with very unusual words and turns of phrase, as if the author had lost the thread of his reasoning every three words. A madman, most likely. It is the travel diary of a sailor, apparently a deserter from the Russian Navy. He traveled the world and saw many strange things, just as incomprehensible as the rest of the book. But you finally figure it out: it is about Kurtz.\n"

"You interrogate the prisoner for hours without success. He remains silent, but his face betrays his emotions at times. On a hunch, you mention Kurtz, and confess your admiration for what he has become. Then the prisoner starts to speak.\n"
"The discussion takes a very disturbing turn when you realize that your admiration for Kurtz is not completely feigned. Your prisoner confides that he is a warrior in Kurtz's personal guard. He knows the Inner Station and the surrounding area well, and talks to you at length about his home, Kurtz and his dreams of greatness. He finally tells you that his mission was to retrieve some of his living God's belongings, which he says someone is keeping on board the Roi des Belges."

"The Director and his accountant are in deep discussion about Kurtz. Apparently, Kurtz was overshadowing the Director, who used his contacts to send the young pretender to the depths of the Congo. But Kurtz stumbled upon a windfall of fossilized ivory, and so his influence has been growing ever since. So it was with some joy that the Director learned of Kurtz's wayward behaviour, and he is determined not to be double-crossed again. The discussion becomes very interesting just as a new noise from the boiler drowns out their words.\n"
"Shortly afterwards, the two move away from you."

"Your discoveries indicate that you have found the mythical Grey City, the mythical lost city of the Congo. In the heart of the ruins, you find the piece of boiler placed prominently next to a huge hole dug in the ground. Looking over the edge, you see a torn jacket at the bottom.\n"
"Cautiously, you reach down into the crater, which is strangely littered with small pieces of ivory, and search the jacket. You find a map of the area. The location of Kurtz's station, which reads \"Home,\" is in the center. A black cross indicates your location. So Kurtz had come to the Grey City, but why? You notice a small obsidian statuette, half-buried not far from the jacket. This pitch-black object has a strange shape. You would swear that it represents a pharaoh, but with typical sub-Saharan African finery. Did the great white ape lure you here to discover all this? Puzzled, you take everything before leaving."

It is the combination of the two that makes him so attractive and terrifying at the same time. However, the dark side of Kurtz is not always present. You feel that he regularly tries to push it away, with increasing difficulty. You take advantage of one of these brief moments of lucidity to convince him to follow you aboard the Roi des Belges, so that he can see for himself that you are able to ensure his safe return.\n"

You see what looks like the steps of a ritual to cage a large, black-skinned pharaoh-like being surrounded by wisps of dark smoke. You understand that the cage is made of ivory, and that the black pharaoh is an incarnation of the Darkness you are fighting against.\n"
"Paradoxically, the fossilized ivory, which seems to be the source of the Darkness' power, is also the main element of the ritual to trap it.
