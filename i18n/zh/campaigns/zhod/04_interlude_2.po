"You retire to your cabin to get as much rest as possible in preparation for what awaits you tomorrow.\n"
"For a moment, you think that the combination of all the horrors you've experienced on the journey and the apprehension at facing Kurtz in his own territory is going to mean sleep eludes you.\n"
"Nevertheless, you sink into a restless sleep, as if your subconscious fitfully refuses to let your mind gradually sink into an ocean of darkness."

"Shouts and shots from a Winchester gun suddenly ring out in the middle of the night. You rush out to see what's going on and find the steamer up in arms. Pilgrims are trying to illuminate the riverbanks while others empty their magazines into the jungle. You find Mateso beside one of his people. The poor man is lying in a pool of blood, gaping wounds all over his body. You understand what has happened as you realize where you are. The injured man was the guard posted in front of the cabin where you were holding your prisoner.\n"
"The Director arrives on the scene and reproachfully says, \"I knew this would happen! Why would you want to keep that man here and put us all in danger? After what he and his kind did to us? We should have gotten rid of him before... And then how did he manage to... well, he's gone now. Let him go to his master. We'll be there before him anyway.\""

Some Pilgrims run up to you and excitedly tell you that they have shot the escaping prisoner. Just as he was about to go overboard.

"Suddenly, shouts ring out in the middle of the night. You rush out to see what's going on and find the steamer up in arms. Some Pilgrims come running to you and excitedly tell you that they have caught the escaped prisoner just as he was trying to get into a cabin next to yours.\n"
"The Director stands above you on the bridge and addresses all the crew members: \"It's okay, we caught that devil! We had to tie him up tighter, and I have posted two armed men outside his cabin. Everyone go back to your quarters!\""

"You enter your cabin, vaguely hoping to get some more rest before arriving - in just a few hours - at your destination. When you open the door, you see, incredulously, that your cabin has been turned upside down. Your brain struggles to process what you see, but you finally realize the obvious. Who else but the escaped prisoner could have done such a thing? You saw all the other crew members on deck just moments ago. A quick inspection of your belongings tells you that nothing has been taken from you, except for Kurtz's belongings which you found in his hiding place at the Central Station.\n"
"You think for a moment. The prisoner took a lot of risks during his escape. Not only did he not leave the ship immediately, but he also created a diversion in order to come and get a few letters and photos belonging to Kurtz.\n"
"You think back to the nighttime assault that happened a while ago. You had thought that the objective was to kill you, or at least to slow down your progress towards Kurtz. But in reality, there were not that many of them, and your losses were limited. What if their goal all along was to recover Kurtz's belongings? You try to remember what was in the documents, if there was anything worth taking such risks to retrieve, but to no avail. No matter, you are convinced, and you are now a little closer to understanding Kurtz's true intentions when you face him."

"You do not immediately obey the Director and instead go to Mateso's side to examine the body. The old man smiles gently at you, then after checking that no one is watching, he slips an envelope containing documents into your hands.\n"
"\"Here,\" the medicine man whispers to you. \"He had this hidden on him. I thought it best to give it to you, rather than to the Director...\"\n"
"Hiding your surprise, you thank Mateso and hurry to your cabin to see what it is. You are surprised to find that it is Kurtz's belongings that you found in his hiding place at the Central Station. And indeed, the safe in your cabin where they were stored is open. Incredible as it may seem, the prisoner escaped without raising an alarm, broke into your quarters, and stole the documents.\n"
"You think for a moment. The prisoner died for a few letters and photos belonging to Kurtz, when he could have jumped overboard immediately after his escape.\n"

"You quickly scan the documents, looking for something worthy of risking one's life to retrieve. To no avail. No matter, you are convinced, and you are now a little closer to understanding Kurtz's true intentions when you face him."
