"The newspaper headline reads, \"Local scientists win Nobel Prize!\" Below it, two elderly physicists are pictured standing proudly in front of a large telescope. You glance at the newspaper's date, your jaw agape. This issue of the <i>Arkham Advertiser</i> is dated December 5, 1956. But how is this possible?\n"
"Surprised and curious, you eagerly read the entire newspaper and learn of two remarkable scientists and their journey to winning a Nobel Prize in physics.\n"
"Born in 1877 in Arkham to Irish immigrants, Thomas Corrigan's earliest memory is when his crayons, left on an outdoor table, melted together under the hot summer sun. From then on, his curiosity and thirst for knowledge grew more rapidly than his height. His wonder at the world around him, from fierce New England thunderstorms to the canvas of stars in the night sky, fueled his passion for the sciences.\n"
"Thomas' desire to attend Miskatonic University is almost as old as his love for learning, as its acclaimed College of Sciences and close proximity made it a natural choice. After getting degrees in undergraduate physics and graduate astrophysics at Miskatonic, he began working at the University's Warren Observatory researching astronomical objects and phenomena.\n"
"Born in 1877 in Warsaw, Poland, Mary Zielinski is the youngest child of two teachers. She has fond memories as a little girl helping her mother with cooking and baking, using cups and teaspoons to measure a variety of ingredients, then mixing those ingredients together to create something entirely new. Thereafter, she began experimenting on her own, which propelled her down the path of chemistry and physics.\n"
"Impressed with Mary's credentials, Miskatonic University offered her a full scholarship. Quiet and introverted, she spent much of her time in the laboratories of the Science building doing various experiments. Her hard work and dedication earned her an undergraduate chemistry degree, and she stayed on at the University to achieve a graduate degree in physics.\n"
"Having common interests, Thomas and Mary eventually became acquainted and a relationship followed. Their shared passion for the sciences encouraged and motivated each other, and they collaborated on several projects.\n"
"Years later, one of their most intriguing projects took off: the possibility of a whole new paradigm based on general relativity, which connects the curvature of spacetime to gravity. They began testing the theory that spacetime could be warped, resulting in a discontinuity. Such a warping could result in portals that lead to distant places across the universe, or even to their own location in another era—in effect, time travel.\n"
"This type of groundbreaking work drew the attention of colleagues from campus and beyond. One of these associates was the brilliant and eccentric Edwin Bennet. A rapidly rising star in the field of quantum physics, Edwin became a professor at his alma mater, Miskatonic University. Young and unpublished, he was eager to prove his knowledge would be invaluable to their project, but others on campus expressed substantial concerns, labeling him as \"reckless\" and \"unstable.\"\n"
"After hitting multiple barriers and looking for inspiration, Thomas and Mary welcomed Edwin's offer to collaborate, and the team was confident they were on the verge of a breakthrough—but it never came. It's unclear what exactly transpired next, though some sort of disagreement or conflict resulted in Edwin being replaced by an even more eccentric scientist, Ezra Graves. Thomas and Mary acknowledged and thanked Edwin for his role in their research.\n"
"Ezra's boundless creativity was integral to Thomas and Mary's new approach to their problems, and this fresh perspective allowed them to overcome the barriers. While Ezra soon moved on to his own projects, his contributions were invaluable and greatly appreciated.\n"
"Over the years, Thomas and Mary's research progressed with success after success, culminating in the discovery of teleportation. They published their remarkable findings on February 23, 1955, to much acclaim. And now—or rather, thirty years from now—they are being awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n"
"Though suspect, your intuition tells you this mysterious newspaper is real. In awe of the future notoriety two local scientists will eventually receive, you go to Miskatonic University to meet them. However, you're informed they are not affiliated with the University and, tragically, both of them disappeared years ago.\n"
"Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, a momentous change has occurred. Prominent scientists have vanished without a trace. Notable inventions have become un-invented. A historic discovery has suddenly been undiscovered. Humanity may never be the same.\n"
"You believe you know the truth, even if it's stranger than fiction. You're quite familiar with the notion of portals—you've been through them yourself. For unknown reasons, Arkham, Massachusetts is rife with such portals, but traveling through them is dangerous and not for the faint of heart.\n"
"Within these portals lies the realm of Tindalos, where countless suspended paths, angular and curved, above and below, wind away in all directions. Here and there, they intersect with ramps and spirals. Prowling along these paths are malevolent minions: ghastly satyrs and Hounds of Tindalos, among other monstrosities. The beasts are eager to savage their prey, or, perhaps worse, abduct and imprison them in Tindalos.\n"
"There has been a distortion in time, and its effects have rippled across the ensuing years. These scientists are two such unfortunate souls, and you'll have to find them and repair the broken timeline. Just remember: traveling through time may cause unintended consequences, some of which will have severe repercussions."

"報紙頭條：“當地科學家榮獲諾貝爾獎！”頭條下方，畫著兩位年長的物理學家自豪地站在一台巨型望遠鏡前。你瞥了一眼報紙上的日期，你啞然張著嘴。阿卡姆報社出版的時間是1956年12月5日，但這怎麼可能呢？\n"
"你既驚訝又好奇，迫切地讀了整份報紙，知曉了兩位傑出的科學家及他們贏得諾貝爾物理學獎的過程。\n"
"托馬斯·科里根是1877年出生於阿卡姆的愛爾蘭移民。他最早的記憶是留在戶外桌子上的蠟筆，在夏日的高溫下融化成一起。從此以後，他的好奇心和求知欲比他的長高的速度還快。他對世界充滿好奇心，從猛烈的新英格蘭雷暴到如畫布般的星空，點燃了他對科學的熱情。\n"
"托馬斯對於進入米斯卡塔尼克大學的欲望，幾乎和以前他對於學習的熱忱一樣，其備受讚譽的科學學院，位置又接近，可謂天然之選。在拿到米斯卡塔尼克大學的物理學本科學位和天體物理學研究生後，他開始在大學的沃倫天文觀測台工作，研究天體與現象。\n"
"1877年出生於波蘭華沙，瑪麗·傑林斯基也是兩名老師中最小的孩子。她從小就有美好的回憶，作為幫助母親做飯和烘焙的女孩，用杯子和茶匙來測量各種成分，然後將它們混合並創造出全新的東西。此後，她開始自己進行實驗，這成為了她走向化學與物理這條路的推力。\n"
"瑪麗的證書給米斯卡塔尼克大學留下深刻的印象，以至於校方提供她全額獎學金。安靜又内向的她，花了很多時間在科學館的實驗室內進行各種實驗。她的努力和刻苦勤奮為她贏得了本科化學學位，並留在大學取得物理學研究生學位。\n"
"有著共同的興趣，托馬斯與瑪莉終為相識並隨後成為戀人關係。他們在科學上分享熱情並鼓勵、激勵彼此，他們也合作過多個計劃。\n"
"多年後，他們最有趣的項目之一開始了：基於廣義相對論的全新範式的可能性，將時空的曲率與重力相互聯在一起。他們開始測試時空可以扭曲的理論，導致不連續性。這種扭曲可能會導致傳送門跨越到宇宙中遙遠的地方，甚至到他們自己的位置的另一個時代——也就是，時間旅行。\n"
"這種開創性的工作在校園和其他地方引起了同事們的關注。其中一位同事當屬才華洋溢和古怪的艾德溫·貝內特。量子物理學領域內一顆冉冉升起的新星，艾德溫成為母校米斯卡塔尼克大學的教授。年輕而未經亮相，他渴望證明他的知識對這個項目是無價的，但其他人在校園裡表達了極大的擔憂，稱他為“魯莽”與“反覆無常”。\n"
"在克服重重障礙與尋找靈感之後，托馬斯和瑪麗對艾德溫的合作提議表示接受，團隊相信他們即將取得突破——然而這並沒有發生。事件之後的發展鮮為人知，儘管有些分歧或衝突導致艾德溫被一個更古怪的科學家，愛茲拉·格雷弗絲所取代。托馬斯和瑪莉承認並感謝艾德溫在他們的研究中所發揮的角色。\n"
"愛茲拉無止境的創意對想要解決問題的托馬斯和瑪麗來說不可或缺，他全新的觀點也讓他們得以突破重重障礙。等到愛茲拉離開前去進行自己的計劃時，他的貢獻已經成為無價之寶，並深受兩人所感激。\n"
"在這幾年中，托馬斯和瑪麗的研究進展接連成功，最終造就了傳送技術的誕生。他們將這場驚人發現於1955年2月23日發表，廣受讚譽。而現在——或者說，三十年後的現在——他們被授予了諾貝爾物理學獎。\n"
"雖然可疑，但你的直覺還是告訴你這份神秘的報紙是真的。你懷著對這兩名本地科學家在未來注定出名的震驚，前往米斯卡塔尼克大學拜訪他們。然而，你被告知們並不屬於這座大學，更不幸的是，他們數年前失蹤了。\n"
"在世人尚未知道之時，已經發生了一場巨變。傑出科學家就這麼不留痕跡地消失了。重要的科學進展退回原點。歷史大發現突然變得無處可尋。人類或許已無回到正軌的可能。\n"
"你堅信你知道的是真相，即便它比小說還要離奇。你對次元門的概念很熟悉——畢竟你自己以前就穿越過。出於某種未知原因，馬薩諸塞州的阿卡姆到處都是這種次元門，不過穿越它們異常危險，需要過人的勇氣。\n"
"次元門的另一邊，是被稱為廷達洛斯的領域。在那裡有無數懸空的道路，既棱角分明、又蜿蜒曲折，或浮於上方、或位於下方——盤根錯節向四面八方延伸。它們在各處和坡道以及螺旋狀尖塔交纏在一起。潛伏於這些道路上的是兇惡的爪牙們：恐怖的薩蒂爾與廷達洛斯獵犬，還有其他各種各樣的怪物。這些野獸熱衷於虐殺獵物，或者更慘的是，將他們綁架並囚禁在廷達洛斯。\n"
"時間出現了亂流，它產生的蕩漾也影響到了之後的歲月。這兩名科學家如此不幸境遇，而你將要找到他們並修復破碎的時間線。切記，時間穿越可能會導致意料之外的後果，甚至會造成無可挽回的惡果。"
