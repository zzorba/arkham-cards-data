"The dead don’t rest. No matter where you go, you hear them talking, whispering, weeping, screaming. Sometimes to each other, sometimes alone. They ramble on about the people they loved, or their job, or the money they hid under the floorboards before they died. Usually it’s about food or drink. The dead are always hungry. Sometimes when they realize you can hear them, they crowd ’round real close and whisper in your ear. Last wishes and such. You try to help when you can, but usually the folks they want you to take care of are dead, too. You make a lot of empty promises, but at least it keeps them quiet.\n"
"It wasn’t always this way. The dead started talking the day your father died in his shotgun house in the French Quarter. You saw him standing over his own body in the living room when you came home; he vanished before you could say a word. From then on, whenever you played your father’s trumpet, you could hear a cacophany of voices. Some of them were human. But there were others, too. Piercing wails from inhuman lips. Gutteral cries. And a crowd of shimmering, spectral faces peering out from the shadows.\n"
"Jean helped you make sense of it all. He stopped to listen to you busking on a Bourbon Street corner and noticed the long look you gave to the ghost lying at your feet. He saw it too. Jean introduced himself as a medium and told you to meet him at his shop in Broadmoor. He told you all about the dead, and the things beyond the grave, and the price you’d pay if you kept company with ’em for too long.\n"
"It was the dead who led you to Arkham. You eke out a living playing your father’s trumpet. The dead get louder when you play. Sometimes they even compliment your music. Last night, Jean found you busking outside the Clover Club, almost like the first time you met. You could tell something was wrong: his face was haggard, and he looked like he hadn’t slept for days. Jean tells you that your father wants to see you, and that you need to go where the boundary between here and thereafter is thin. You tell him you know just the place. Hangman’s Hill is rife with spirits. Maybe if you do them a few favors, they’ll do you one in return."

"死者並不安息。無論你去到哪裡，你都聽到它們說話、低語、哭泣、尖叫。有時對著彼此，有時則是獨自。它們喃喃不休地談論它們所愛的人、它們的工作，或者它們死前藏在樓板底下的錢。常常與食物或飲料有關，死者總是飢餓的。有時，當它們意識到你能聽見它們的聲音時，它們就會緊緊地圍在你身邊，在你耳邊低語最後的願望等等。你試著盡力提供幫助，但通常它們希望你幫助的對象也已經死了。你做了很多空洞的承諾，至少能讓它們安靜下來。\n"
"好景不常，從你父親死在法蘭西區的獵槍小屋裡的那一天起，死者就開始說話了。你回到家時，在客廳裡看到你父親站在自己的屍體上；你還來不及說話，他就消失了。從那時起，每當你吹奏父親的小號時，你都會聽到不和諧的聲音。一些是人的聲音，也有一些其他的聲音；非人般的嘴唇發出刺耳的哀嚎、喉音的哭喊、還有一群微微發光的幽靈臉孔從陰影中窺探。\n"
"幫助你了解這一切的是尚。當你在波旁街轉角處表演時，他停下來聽並注意到你長長地看了躺在你腳下的鬼魂一眼。他也看得到。尚介紹自己是靈媒，並要你去他位於布羅德莫的商店與他見面。他告訴你所有關於死者以及墳墓彼端的事情，還有如果你與他們相處太久，會付出什麼代價。\n"
"讓你來到阿卡姆的原因也是死者。你靠著演奏父親的小號勉強維持生計。當你演奏時，死者的聲音變得更大聲。有時它們甚至會欣賞你的音樂。昨晚，你在四葉草俱樂部外面街頭表演時遇到尚，就像你們第一次見面一樣。但你發現有些不對勁：他臉色憔悴，樣子看起來像是好幾天沒睡覺。尚告訴你，你的父親想見你，為此你需要去一個現世與彼端之間界線很薄弱的地方。你告訴他你知道這樣的地方：絞刑者山丘上充斥著鬼魂。如果你幫它們一些忙，也許它們也會給你一些回報。"

"Phantasmagoric shapes form and recede in the mist around you. As you take Jean’s hands, the medium falls into a dead faint. In the dark, you glimpse your father’s face: his laugh lines, his kind eyes, his smile. Your father is with you at last.\n"

Despite the knot in your stomach, you feel a sense of relief in knowing that your father was here, however briefly, and that he saw you. As you help Jean to his feet, you hear your father’s voice in your ear, whispering encouragement over the riot of ghosts bickering in your ears. You hope he never goes quiet."
