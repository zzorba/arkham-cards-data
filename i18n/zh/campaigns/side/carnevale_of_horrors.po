"\"Look,\" Sheriff Engel insists, \"I know it sounds crazy, but that's really all there is to it.\" He sighs and sits back down, pouring a cup of joe for you and one for himself. \"A dame in Uptown spotted a cracked egg wearing this mask and holdin' a bloody butcher's cleaver,\" he says, motioning to the black leather mask sitting on his desk. It has a comically long nose and a strange symbol scrawled in yellow on its forehead. \"So, she calls it in. My boys and I picked him up on the corner of Saltonstall & Garrison.\" The sheriff's jaw clenches and his brows furrow as he recounts the story. \"Fella did nothing but laugh as we slapped the bracelets on him. Called himself Zanni. Said nothing except the 'carnival is coming'; whatever the hell that meant. Wasn't until the next day we found the victim's body. Defense wanted him in a straitjacket. We were happy to oblige.\"\n"
"There isn't much time to spare. If your research is right, there is more to this case than meets the eye. This \"Zanni\" wasn't talking about Darke's Carnival, but rather the Carnevale of Venice, which begins just before the next full moon."

"“聽著，”恩格爾警長態度很堅定，“我知道這聽起來很瘋狂，但事情就是這樣的。”他嘆了口氣，坐回椅子上，給你和他各倒上一杯咖啡。“住宅區有一位夫人看見一個怪人戴著這面具，手裡還握著一把淌血的屠刀。”他說著，示意桌面上的黑色皮質面具。這個面具有著滑稽的長鼻子，前額上還潦草地畫著一個怪異的黃色符號。 “所以她報了警。我和我的夥計們在索頓斯托爾街和加里森街的交叉口逮住了那傢伙。”警長在複述事情經過的時候，咬緊牙關，眉頭皺緊。“我們給那個小夥子銬上手銬的時候，他一個勁大笑。他把自己叫做丑角，還一直在說著‘狂歡節要開始了’，天知道他說的是什麼意思。直到第二天我們找到了受害者的屍體，才把這和他說的話聯繫起來。辯方要求他穿上拘束衣。我們也樂於照做。”\n"
"時間所剩不多。如果你的調查無誤，這起事件遠遠沒有表面上那麼簡單。這個“丑角”說的不是達克的狂歡節，而是在下個滿月之前舉辦的威尼斯狂歡節……"

msgid "Choose 1 location at random and remove it from the game. If San Marco Basilica or Canal-side is chosen, randomly choose a different location instead."
msgstr "隨機選擇1個地點並將其移出遊戲。如果所選地點為“聖馬可大教堂”或“運河畔”，改為隨機選擇一個其他地點。"

msgid "Put the other 8 locations into play, in a random circular formation. Each investigator begins play in San Marco Basilica. Put Abbess Allegria Di Biase into play at San Marco Basilica."
msgstr "將其他8個地點放置入場，隨機地排列成圓圈。每位調查員從“聖馬可大教堂”開始遊戲。將“修道院院長阿萊格·迪·拜絲”放置進場，位於“聖馬可大教堂”。"

msgid "Shuffle the 7 Masked Carnevale-Goers and put 1 into play at each location other than San Marco Basilica, Masked Carnevale-Goers side face-up. Do not look at their other sides."
msgstr "將7張“佩戴面具的狂歡節行人”混洗並放置入場，在除“聖馬可大教堂”外的每個地點各放置1張，以“佩戴面具的狂歡節行人”面朝上放置。不要查看這些卡牌的背面。"

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Cnidathqua, Pantalone, Medico Della Peste, Bauta, Gilded Volto."
msgstr "將下列卡牌放在一邊，位於場外：“奈達斯奎”、“潘塔洛內”、“瘟疫醫生”、“包塔面具”、“華飾幽靈面具”。"

msgid "Location Setup"
msgstr "地點設置"

msgid "In this scenario, locations are placed in a circle. Due to the parade during the Carnevale, each location is connected only to the location in the clockwise direction. This means that investigators and monsters can only travel (or count the nearest location) in the clockwise direction unless otherwise noted."
msgstr "在本場冒險中，所有地點排列成圓形。由於狂歡節期間的遊行，每個地點只與自己順時針方向的地點連接。這意味著調查員和怪物只能按順時針方向移動(或計算最近地點)，除非有特殊說明。"

msgid "Counter-clockwise"
msgstr "逆時針方向"

msgid "Some cards instruct the players to find the nearest location in the counter-clockwise direction. This is an exception to the above rule and should be followed as though locations are connected counter-clockwise."
msgstr "一些卡牌會指示玩家找出逆時針方向最近的地點。這是上一條規則的例外情況，遵守這一規則進行計算時，視為所有地點按逆時針方向連接。"

msgid "\"Across from\""
msgstr "“對面”"

msgid "The location \"across from\" another location is the farthest location, equidistant in both the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. For the purpose of this scenario, \"across from your location\" and \"across from you\" have the same meaning."
msgstr "如果一個地點在另一個地點的“對面”，那麼這兩個地點必須相隔最遠，不論按順時針還是逆時針，它們之間的距離都相等。在本場冒險中，“你所在地點‘對面’”和“你‘對面’”的意思相同。"

msgid "many were sacrificed to Cnidathqua during the Carnevale."
msgstr "狂歡節期間許多平民被獻祭給奈達斯奎。"

msgid "In player order, each investigator may choose one of the following [[Mask]] cards to add to their deck: Pantalone, Medico Della Peste, Bauta, Gilded Volto. The chosen card does not count towards that investigator's deck size."
msgstr "按玩家順序，每位調查員可以從以下[[面具]]卡牌中選擇一張，加入其牌組：“潘塔洛內”、“瘟疫醫生”、“包塔面具”或“華飾幽靈面具”。調查員所選卡牌不計入其牌組張數。"

msgid "\"Grazie mille—thank you for all your help.\" Allegria says as you return to the basilica. \"Thanks to you, there were few casualties. I shudder to think what might have happened had you not arrived. Should you ever require assistance, please do not hesitate to ask.\""
msgstr "“非常感謝——謝謝你的援助。”在你回到大教堂時，阿萊格說道。“這次沒有多少人受傷，都是多虧了你。要是你沒來會是一副什麼樣的境況，我想到就害怕。如果你需要幫助，請儘管開口。”"

msgid "Any one investigator may choose to add Abbess Allegria Di Biase to their deck. This card does not count toward that investigator’s deck size."
msgstr "任意一位調查員可以選擇將“修道院院長阿萊格·迪·拜絲”加入其牌組。這張卡牌不計入該調查員的牌組張數。"

msgid "Too many lives were lost during the eclipse to stop the machinations of Cnidathqua's servants. The beast has been fed, its minions empowered. You find yourself hoping you don't live long enough to see the fallout of your failure."
msgstr "日蝕期間喪生的人數過多，以致無法阻止奈達斯奎僕從的陰謀。怪物飽腹之後，將力量賦予自己的爪牙。你發現自己盼望生命快些結束，以免見證自己失敗造成的惡果。"

msgid "Each investigator searches the collection for a random basic [[Madness]], [[Injury]], or [[Monster]] weakness and adds it to their deck for the remainder of the campaign."
msgstr "每位調查員從收藏中找出一張隨機的[[瘋狂]]、[[損傷]]或[[怪物]]基礎弱點，然後將它加入自己的牌組，直到當前劇本結束。"

msgid "You sputter awake as an oar gently taps your shoulder. \"Tutto bene?\" The gondolier holding the oars says with a concerned expression. You nod and drag yourself onto the docks from his gondola, drenched and aching all over. The city is devastated. Most of the boats in the canal are wrecked. The streets are covered not in confetti, but in blood."
msgstr "一隻船槳輕輕地敲了敲你的肩膀，你驟然驚醒。“你還好嗎？”貢多拉船夫握著船槳，一臉關切地用義大利語問道。你點點頭，從他的貢多拉勉強爬回碼頭上，渾身濕透，疼痛不已。整座城市都被毀了。運河上的大多數船隻都已遭破壞，而街道上遍地覆蓋的不是彩紙，而是血液……"

msgid "The city is still recovering from the events during the eclipse. With nearly all evidence of the creature melted away by the hot sun, many attribute the violence during the Carnevale to local crime lord Cascio Di Boerio and his crew. Those that know the truth know better than to speak of the elder creature that lives in Laguna Veneta. With any luck, its name will never be spoken again."
msgstr "這座城市正從日蝕期間的種種事件中逐漸恢復。在灼熱的太陽照耀下，有關那頭怪物的一切證據幾乎都已消失不見，許多人將狂歡節期間發生的兇案歸咎於當地犯罪頭目卡西奧·迪·博里奧和他的手下。而知曉真相的人知道，最好不要提及威尼斯潟湖裡居住著的那隻古代生物。如果運氣好的話，它的名諱再也不會被人說起。"

msgid "The creature recoils as globules of its jelly-like flesh rip and tear from its body, splashing into the lagoon. It makes no sound as its torn body sinks into the depths. The chanting in the city plunges into mournful silence. As you return to the canal-side streets, black feathers fall from the sky where bright confetti once fluttered. You can only wonder how long it will take for the creature to recover."
msgstr "怪物退縮了，它膠狀的肉球從它身體剝落下來，濺入潟湖。它被撕裂的身體無聲地沉入深海。城市裡的吟唱聲嘎然而止，取而代之的是哀傷的沉默。你返回運河旁邊的街道時，曾經飄揚著豔麗彩紙的地方飄落許多黑色羽毛。你只想知道那頭怪物多久之後會再恢復。"

msgid "Choose masks:"
msgstr "選擇面具："
