msgid ""
"You’ve always known there was something…different…about you. From a young age, in your dreams, you saw another realm. Another life. One of magick and majesty, of conquest and persecution. The moment you found that strange, old key—the moment you recognized the filigree along its handle, the pattern of its teeth—you knew those dreams weren’t dreams at all, but memories. Memories of another life. Of a place called “Hyperborea.” And as the memories returned, the magic did, too.\n"
"For months you practiced in secret, delving into your memories and honing your powers. But lately, your dreams have turned dark and grisly. Your former self was not as caring or forviging as you. She was ruthless. Power-hungry. Terrible to behold. You’ve taken it upon yourself to wield these strange powers only to help others, and not to hurt them.\n"
"But you’re not the only one whose memories have started to return. Elspeth Baudin first visited the diner a few weeks ago. In the beginning, she was just a patron like any other. She ordered eggs, bacon and a black coffee, not unlike many of the other customers at Velma’s. But there was something in her eyes— some spark of recognition or curiosity—that made you wary of her.\n"
"Then came the questions.\n"
"First, she asked about the key you wore on a chain around your neck. You gave her your best smile and told her your usual lie—that it was a family heirloom, a harmless trinket with no worth but its sentimental value. But that didn’t deter her. She started prying about your life, about your family…about your dreams.\n"
"Elspeth was no normal patron. She wasn’t making small talk. She was looking for answers, just the same as you. So you did some digging of your own. But there were no records of Elspeth being a resident of Arkham, and the few people you found who knew of her spoke only in hushed, frightened voices, and gave you very little to work with.\n"
"Then came a call from the Curiositie Shoppe in Northside. Elspeth had been searching for more artifacts like your own “hierloom,” even going so far as to utter the name Hyperborea. She is searching for something that can unlock more of her memories, just like you…but she is <i>not</i> like you. That sinister smirk of hers, the way her contacts trembled with fear at the mention of her name—you shudder to think what somebody with foul intentions could do with the sort of powers your memories hold…"

"一直以來，你都知道你與其眾不同。從小時候起，你就在夢中看到了另一個國度；另一種生活。那是一種充滿魔法和威嚴、征服和迫害的生活。在你發現那把奇怪的、古老的鑰匙——當你認出手柄上的雕飾和鑰匙的形式——的那一刻，你就意識到那些夢根本不是夢，而是記憶；前世的記憶。那是一個叫做“希波利爾”的地方。隨著記憶湧現，魔力也恢復了。\n"
"幾個月來，你一直在秘密地練習，深入研究自己的記憶並磨練自己的力量。但最近，你的夢境變得黯淡和陰沉。前世的你沒有現在的你那麼關懷和寬容。她殘酷、渴望力量、難以相處。你已經決定好要妥善運用這些奇異的力量，用來幫助他人，而不是傷害他們。\n"
"但你並不是唯一一個開始找回記憶的人。愛爾佩絲·博丹幾週前第一次來到餐廳。一開始，她就只是一個平凡的顧客。她點了雞蛋、培根和一杯黑咖啡，就像維爾瑪餐館裡的其他顧客一樣。但是她的眼睛裡有些什麼——一種確認或好奇的光芒，讓你心生警惕。\n"
"然後問題就來了。\n"
"起初，她問了你戴在脖子的項鍊上的鑰匙。你擠出一個完美的笑容，並告訴了她你平時準備好的謊言——那是家族的傳家寶，一個無害的小飾品，沒什麼價值，只有紀念意義。但這並沒有阻止她。她開始刺探您的生活、家庭……甚至你的夢境。\n"
"愛爾佩絲不是一般的顧客。她不是在跟你閒聊，她在尋找她想要的答案，就跟你一樣。因此，你自己做了一些調查。沒有任何記錄表明愛爾佩絲住在阿卡姆，而且你發現少數幾個與她有接觸的人，說話的聲音都很微弱，充滿恐懼，幾乎對你沒有任何幫助。\n"
"然後，位於北區的珍品店給你打了一通電話。愛爾佩絲一直在尋找更多的文物，類似你的“傳家寶”，或是名字裡帶有“希波利爾”的東西。她正在尋找可以釋放更多記憶的東西，像你一樣……但是她<i>不</ i>像你。你想起她那陰險的笑容，還有接觸到她的人一聽到她的名字，就因恐懼而顫抖的模樣——一想到如果懷有惡意的人擁有你的記憶裡的那種力量之後，能做出什麼事，你不禁感到不寒而慄……"

msgid "It would be so simple. You could end her right now. Prevent her from menacing others with her powers…But then, would you be any different? You lower your hand, and the magic disperses into the cold air. “Why?” she asks, her voice cracked with pain. You shake your head and tell her that she is wrong. True power is the ability to make peace, not the ability to wage war. “Fool,” she barks, clambering to her feet. “You are a weakling, after all. And you will regret letting me live.” You watch her amble off with only fragments of her former life in her head. Her powers are considerably drained, but she still poses a problem. Perhaps you should have dealt with her, as she said. Still, you breathe a sigh of relief. You don’t want this power to change who you are. You won’t let yourself become like her. No matter what."
msgstr "你可以很簡單地結束她的性命。一勞永逸地阻止她濫用這些力量威脅他人……但是如果這麼做，你又會與她有什麼差別呢？你放下手，魔力消散在冷冽的空氣中。“為什麼？”她問道，她的聲音因疼痛而斷斷續續。你搖搖頭，告訴她她錯了。真正的力量是建立和平的能力，而不是發動戰爭的能力。“蠢蛋，”她叫道，勉強站起來。“最終你還是這麼軟弱。你會後悔讓我活下去的。”你看著她緩慢地離去，她腦海中前世的記憶僅存破碎的片段，力量已幾乎被消耗殆盡。但她仍然是個問題，也許你應該如她所說地對付她。不過，你還是鬆了一口氣。你不希望這股力量改變了你。無論如何，你不會讓自己變得像她一樣。"

msgid "Elspeth has you at her mercy. She raises her hand, her magic threatening to tear you apart. She smirks. You close your eyes and brace yourself…but no killing blow comes. Instead, she yanks you to your feet and wipes dust off your apron. “Come now,” she purrs with a devilish grin. “You are no whimpering animal. Don’t you remember what you truly are? What we truly are?” Then, without any further punishment, she departs, leaving you with only fragments of your former life."
msgstr "愛爾佩絲完全制伏了你。她舉起手，魔力威脅著要把你撕成碎片。她冷笑著，你閉上眼睛，作好了心理準備……但致命一擊沒有到來。取而代之的是，她粗魯地拉你起來，擦去你圍裙上的灰塵。“來，”她帶著壞笑說道。“你可不是哭哭啼啼的小動物。你不記得自己的本性了嗎？我們的本性？”然後，她沒有再對你做什麼就離開了，只留下你，與你僅存的破碎前世記憶。"
