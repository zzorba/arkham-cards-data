"People don’t care about the ones who get left behind. That’s the first thing you learned on the street, after you left the orphanage. You’ve had to fend for yourself, do whatever you can to scrape by. So far, with just your wits and the amulet Mama left you before they took her away, you’ve managed to survive. Occasionally, someone will show some compassion and throw a coin or two into your cup. One glorious morning, a nice lady leaving Velma’s gave you her leftover sausage and eggs. But for the most part, you’ve only had yourself to rely on. The other street rats might be in the same boat as you, but you would hesitate to call any of them friends, save for maybe James, and that is a stretch. No—hunger, loneliness, boredom, and doubt are your best and only friends. And despite all that, it’s still somehow better than the orphanage.\n"
"Then the fateful day arrived. It began like any other, with you and James working your way through Rivertown, “collecting” anything you might be able to sell to Oliver Thomas. The rest would surely go to Marvin’s gang—a bunch of street kids who banded together to bully the rest—but there is one trinket among your earnings that sparks your eye: a photograph. Not just any photograph, but one of your father.\n"
"It is unmistakable. There is no doubt in your mind. In the photo, your father stands in front of a building you don’t recognize. The sign behind him looks to be in a different language, so probably someplace far, far away. There’s no way of telling how recently the photo was taken. It is worn, dirty, and nicked in several places. You turn it over and there, scrawled in familiar handwriting, you read: “Soon the Red Tide rises. Stay safe, my little girl.”\n"
"You beg James to tell you where the photo came from, and he claims a man in a long wool coat and a dark brown derby dropped it in your cup sometime before you ran into Marvin’s gang. You set off at once, asking around to find the man in the derby. Your only lead is that he hopped on a bus near Easttown. The decrepit, unmarked bus that runs to the harbor town of Innsmouth. You scrounge up as many coins as you can and board the only bus to the old, forsaken seaport. If Dad is still out there, you have to find him. You have to!"

"大家都不會在乎那些被遺棄的人。這是你離開孤兒院後，流落街頭時學到的第一件事。你必須自謀生計，盡力而為才能勉強度日。到目前為止，憑藉著你的機智和媽媽被他們帶走之前留給你的護身符，你成功地活了下來。偶爾，有人會展現一點同情心，往你的杯子里扔一兩枚硬幣。某個愉快的早晨，一位離開維爾瑪餐館的善良女士把她剩下的香腸和雞蛋給了你。但大多數情況下，你只能靠自己。其他流浪街頭的小鬼可能和你處境相同，但你猶豫是否要把他們中的任何人當作是朋友，也許詹姆斯可以，但也很勉強。不——飢餓、孤單、無聊和猜疑是你最好，也是唯一的朋友。儘管如此，這還是比待在孤兒院更好。\n"
"然後命運性的一天到來了。一開始就像其他平凡的日子，你和詹姆斯一路穿過河岸城，沿路“收集”任何你可能可以賣給奧利弗·托馬斯的東西。剩下的肯定會被馬爾文的幫派——一群流浪兒聯合起來欺負其他流浪兒——搜括走。但在你的戰利品中，有一個小飾品讓你眼前一亮：一張照片。那不是一張普通的照片，是你爸爸的照片。\n"
"你絕不會弄錯，心中確信無疑。照片裡，你爸爸站在一棟你不認得的建築物前面。他身後的標誌看起來是不同的語言，所以可能是在很遠很遠的某個地方。你沒有辦法知道這張照片是多久拍攝的。照片有好幾個地方都磨損、污漬和缺口了。你把它翻過來，上面熟悉而潦草的字跡寫著：“赤潮很快就會升起。保持安全，我的女兒。”\n"
"你哀求詹姆斯告訴你這張照片是從哪裡來的，他宣稱在你遇到馬爾文的幫派前的某個時候，一個穿著長羊毛外套和深棕色圓頂硬帽的男人把它丟進了你的杯子裡。你立即行動，四處打聽，尋找那個戴著圓頂硬帽的人。你唯一的線索是他在東城區附近跳上了一輛巴士。那輛破舊、無標記的巴士是開往港口城鎮印斯茅斯的。你盡你所能地搜刮硬幣，然後坐上唯一的巴士路線，前往古老、失落的海港。如果爸爸還在那裡，你一定要找到他，一定要！"

"You didn’t find Dad, but you were able to find the next best thing: the man in the brown derby. You approach casually, hoping he’ll ignore you like everyone else tends to do, so you can confront him. You follow him into a dark alley and immediately realize he’s leading you somewhere hidden away from prying eyes. “Didn’t think you’d follow me,” he says once you’re alone.\n"
"The questions come pouring out of you. Does he know your father? Where is he? Why the photo? What is the Red Tide? But he simply holds up a finger to his lips. “Shhh, kid. You’re gonna get me killed.” He sighs, removes his cap, and runs his trembling fingers through oily hair. “Look, all I can tell you is…your Dad, he fell in with some bad people. Some real scary people. But he wanted out. And the only way out…” he grimaces and shakes his head. “You gotta understand. He can’t come home. You’d be in danger. So would he. But…he still wanted you to know that he loves you. So…”\n"
"You wipe a stray tear that threatens to crawl down your cheek. The man looks terrified. He’s either a world-class actor, or he’s telling the truth. You ask him one last question—who are the bad people Dad fell in with?—but the moment you ask, he shakes his head and backs away. “I’ve already said too much!” is the last thing he says before he flees."

"你沒有找到爸爸，但退而求其次，你找到了戴著棕色圓頂硬帽的男人。你假裝隨意地靠近，希望他會像其他人一樣忽視你，這樣你就可以面對他。你跟著他走進一條黑暗的小巷，立即就意識到他正在將你帶離開到不受窺探的地方。“沒想到你會跟著我，”等到你獨自一人時，他說道。\n"
"問題從你身上傾瀉而出。他認識你爸爸嗎？他在哪裡？照片是為什麼？什麼是赤潮？但他只是將一根手指放在嘴邊。“噓，孩子。你會害死我的。”他嘆了口氣，摘下帽子，將顫抖的手指撫過油膩的頭髮。“聽著，我只能告訴你……你爸爸，他結交了一些壞人，一些很可怕的人。他想抽身，但唯一的出路……”他做了個厭惡的表情，搖搖頭。“你得明白，他無法回家。你會有危險，他也會。但是……他還是想讓你知道他愛你。所以……”\n"
"你擦去一滴快要從臉頰上滴落的眼淚。這個男人看起來很害怕。如果他不是超一流的演員，那他說的就是實話。你問他最後一個問題——和爸爸在一起的壞人是誰？——但你的問題一說出口，他立刻搖了搖頭，轉身離開。“我已經說太多了！”這是他逃走前留下的最後一句話。"

msgid "You wait for your pursuers to round the corner before making your way stealthily back to the bus stop and getting on the next bus to Arkham. You crumple the sides of Dad’s photo in anger. A stray teardrop trails down your cheek. You still have no real leads. Who was the man in the derby and the wool coat that morning? What have you gotten yourself mixed up with? But, glancing once more at the photo, one hope still lingers in your mind: Dad is alive. He has to be."
