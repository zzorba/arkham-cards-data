"<i>0312 hours - Impact event just outside of Blackwater. Intercepted police call, agents sent to investigate. Interviewed local farmer, Ron Graham; claims meteor was several feet wide, greenish hue. Crater roughly 100 yards in diameter. Radiation detected in outlying area. Recommend immediate quarantine and further observation by research team. Situation under control.</i>"

"<i>事件報告：8L-08</i>\n"
"<i>1928年7月5日，星期四</i>\n"
"<i>馬薩諸塞州黑水鎮</i>\n"
"\n"
"<i>上午3時12分——黑水鎮外發生隕石撞擊事件。警方接到來電，並派出探員前往調查。當地農夫朗·格雷厄姆接受詢問時，聲稱那是一塊綠色的隕石，足有數英尺寬。隕石坑的直徑為100碼(91.44米)，在其外圍區域探測到輻射。建議立即隔離，並且交由研究團隊進一步觀察。局勢已得到控制。</i>"

msgid ""
"It wasn't under control.\n"
"That was the report the G-men took when they first arrived. For the next few days, the town of Blackwater was on lockdown. The impact was all that was talked about in the papers, but not much was known aside from the enormous crater and the effect it had on the countryside. Nobody was allowed to leave the town, and only those approved by the shadow government agency was allowed to enter. Those unfortunate few included high-ranking government agent, and a team of researchers from the nearby Miskatonic University, who were summoned to investigate the meteor itself. For the rest of the town's inhabitants, it was a strange occurence, nothing more… that is, until the meteor <i>hatched</i>.\n"
"I saw it with my own eyes. When the anomaly emerged, the first thing it did was devour the team of researchers who have been sent to collect and study samples from the meteor. The next thing it did was devour their lab equipment. Then Ron Graham's tractor. Then his house, in its entirety. It continued to grow and spread, devouring everything in its path. I barely escaped with my life.\n"
"When the army arrived, they thought they could kill it with bullets and shells. Everything they threw at the creature was devoured, one round after the next. Then it split into hundreds of smaller pieces of itself, and the army was quickly overwhelmed. While the battle raged on, myself and others back in town saw lights and shapes in the sky above. Something was up there, waiting. Biding time.\n"
"The quarantine still holds, and we're stuck in the middle of it. It won't be long before the anomaly has grown large enough to devour everything in Blackwater. And if that happens, who could possibly stop its rampage?"
msgstr ""
"局勢並沒有得到控制。\n"
"這份報告是最先到達此地的聯邦調查員寫下的。在接下來的幾天裡，黑水鎮處於封鎖狀態。眾多報紙都登載了隕石撞擊一事，但除了巨大的隕石坑和它對村莊造成的影響之外，人們對這件事知道的並不多。任何人都不允許離開這座小鎮，進鎮也必須得到政府秘密機構的批准。有少數人不幸地得到了這一批准，其中包含高級政府特工，為了調查隕石，還找來了附近的米斯卡塔尼克大學的一隊研究員。對這座小鎮其餘的住民來說，這不過是件怪事，別無其他……直到那塊隕石“孵化”。\n"
"我親眼目睹了那一幕。怪物現身時，它先是吞噬了派去收集和研究隕石様本的整隊研究員，緊接著是他們的實驗儀器。再是朗·格雷厄姆的拖拉機，然後將他的房子整個吞入。它繼續生長、擴大，將沿路遇到的一切都吃乾抹淨。我差點沒能活著逃出來。\n"
"軍隊趕到時，他們還以為能用槍子兒和炮彈把這玩意給幹掉。他們一波又一波地發起攻勢，但不論他們用了什麼武器，都會成為那頭怪物的食糧。然後它自己分裂成數百個碎片，轉瞬間湮沒了整支軍隊。戰爭打得激烈，此時我和返回小鎮的其他人一同望向上空，看見無數光芒與形狀在變換。天上有什麼東西等待著，等待著時機到來。\n"
"小鎮仍被隔離，我們被困在鎮上了。那頭怪物越長越大，要不了多久，整座黑水鎮都會被它吞噬。到那個時候，誰還能阻止它肆虐呢？"
