"Red tape is stifling. Ever since you arrived in Arkham, your cases have gotten harder and harder to navigate. You thought you would be tracking down smugglers and mobsters, not imaginary monsters. But the longer your absurd cases remain open, the more you begin to think maybe they aren’t so absurd, after all. And perhaps that means the monsters aren’t imaginary, either.\n"
"The Bureau has countless guidelines for handling cases of all sorts, but it is eerily silent on the matter of human sacrifices. So when you were told about the bodies found inside the Black Cave, you weren’t sure where to begin. Questioning the locals and loved ones of the deceased yielded nothing of value. The evidence left behind in the cave was unhelpful, to say the least—offerings and writings proclaiming the sacrifices to be gifts, along with depictions of a monstrous tree. So you did what you do best: you put your nose to the ground and found the thread connecting all of the deaths.\n"
"One man lies at the center of all of the victims: Mr. Damien Grey. The congressman is not from Arkham, has no relatives or loved ones in the area, and is on no committee that would require his presence in town. And yet, he’s been staying in Arkham for the past few months, his purpose unknown. And he is connected to each of the victims through no more than two degrees of separation, which smells fishy to you. Fishier still is the police escort that follows Mr. Grey through town 24/7, despite the fact that there have been no threats on the congressman’s well-being.\n"
"You have to get to the bottom of this mystery, and soon. Now you see that damned tree everywhere. More people go missing by the day, and some have even claimed to see goatlike monsters prowling the alleyways. But if Mr. Grey is indeed behind this, you’ll have to be careful. Falsely accusing a politician would certainly spell the end of your career. Time to do what you came to do: dig up the proof, discover the truth, and bring the culprits in for questioning. Every “i” dotted, every “t” crossed."

"繁文縟節簡直令人窒息。自從你來到阿卡姆後，你的案件變得越來越難處理。你以為你會對付走私者和暴徒，而不是虛構的怪物。但是，隨著這些荒謬案件懸而未決的時間拖得越長，你漸漸開始覺得這些案件沒這麼荒謬了。也許這意味著怪物不是憑空想像出來的。\n"
"當局有無數的指導方針，能夠處理各種案件，但是出奇地缺了獻祭人類的方面。所以，當你被通知在黑暗洞窟裡發現了屍體時，你不太確定該怎麼開始。詢問當地人和死者的親人沒有什麼結果。洞穴中留下的證據也沒甚麼價值——供品和文字宣稱說這場獻祭是贈禮，還描繪了一棵怪物般的樹。所以你只能盡你所擅長的事情：嗅出線索，尋找連接所有死亡事件的共通點。\n"
"所有受害者的交集是一名男子：國會議員戴米恩·格雷先生。他不是阿卡姆本地人，在本地沒有親戚或家人，鎮上也沒有需要他出席的會議。然而，過去幾個月他一直待在阿卡姆，目的不明。而且他與每個受害者相連的分隔度都不超過兩度，這對你來說相當蹊蹺。儘管國會議員沒有受到任何威脅，但仍然有位警察——費希爾——全天候貼身護送格雷先生在鎮上的行動。\n"
"你得盡快解開這個謎團的真相。現在你到處都看到那棵該死的樹。每天都有更多的人失蹤，甚至有人聲稱看到了像山羊一樣的怪物在小巷裡徘徊。但如果格雷先生真的是這件事的幕後黑手，你就得十分小心。要是錯誤地指控一個政客，你的職業生涯肯定就完了。該是時候盡你的職責了：挖掘證據、找出真相，把罪魁禍首帶回來審問。每個細節都必須一絲不苟。"
