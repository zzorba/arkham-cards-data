msgid "Your cell has been given the name of a contact at Défis de la Roulette: Isamara Ordoñez. Isamara is not just an employee there, she is the \"Flor de Nicaragua,\" a singer whose performances have become a major draw for the casino. She has reputedly reached out to various parties for help over the course of the past month, concerned with some of the events she has witnessed behind the scenes. The Foundation has reason to believe a Key may be involved in these strange events. You find a table in the casino lounge, and wait for an opportune moment to attract her attention. Only a few minutes later, a woman in a striking red dress takes the stage. Her performance is so captivating that she is already leaving the stage before you remember why you are here. There is no doubt that she is the one you are looking for. As she glances at the crowd, you give a small wave. At first, she appears to take little notice, but then her eyes fall to the flower that you were told to wear. She approaches your table and sits down. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"If you were sent by Them, its not safe to talk here. Meet me in an hour.\" She hands you a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance!\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. Hope to see you again soon!\""
msgstr "你取得了一個名字：伊薩瑪拉·奧多涅斯，她是你在輪盤挑戰中的聯絡人。伊薩瑪拉不是普通員工，她是被稱為“尼加拉瓜之花”的歌手，她的表演是賭場的主要賣點。據說她在過去幾個月秘密幫助了幾個想調查這些奇異事件的組織，她對於自己在幕後目擊到的一些事件非常擔憂。根據目前掌握的情報，基石相信這些超自然事件背後有密鑰的力量作祟。你在賭場交誼廳的一張空桌坐下，等待引起她注意的時機。幾分鐘後，一名女子身穿一襲令人驚豔的紅色禮服走上舞台，她的表演攝人心魄，一直到她走下舞台，你才重新想起自己前來的原因。毫無疑問，她就是你要找的人。當她掃視人群時，你向她低調的揮手。一開始她似乎並沒有注意，但接著她看見了你配戴的花，這是你們約定好的暗號。她走到你的桌子旁坐下，臉上掛著輕鬆的微笑，但話語卻緊繃而尖銳：“這裡不安全，一個小時後跟我碰面。”她將一張卡片塞進你手中，上面寫著附近一間咖啡廳的地址。她隨即起身，撫平禮服上的皺褶。“謝謝各位的讚美！”她向所有觀眾說，“希望很快能再相見！”"
