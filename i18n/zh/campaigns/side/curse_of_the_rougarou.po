"Minnie Klein, your contact at the Arkham Advertiser, had slipped you a draft of the article over a cup of coffee at Velma's Diner. It would have gone to print had Doyle Jeffries, the lead editor, not scoffed at the concept. \"I believe his exact words were, 'I ain't printing it off as news,'\" she explained. From the sly grin spreading across her face, you could tell she smelled a story.\n"
"The headline was sensaltionalist. Three killings in nine days was enough to spook a town, sure. But you doubt all of New Orleans is gripped by terror, or even knows about the killings. Still, something piqued your interest. \"Lady Esprit,\" the Voodoo priestess from the article, claimed that a malign curse had taken root in the bayou.\n"
"\"There's something to this, isn't there? I know that look,\" Minnie said. You weren't sure. If Lady Esprit was right, this \"roux-ga-roux\" wouldn't stop killing at three, that's for sure. But curses? Wolf-people? How could such things be real? Only one way to find out. You put on your coat and head for the Northside Station."

"在維爾瑪小餐館，你和你阿卡姆報社的聯絡人明妮·克萊因見面，她從桌子對面遞給你一篇文章手稿。要不是因為主編道爾·傑弗里斯的嘲弄，它早就該登報了。“我記得他的原話是：‘我是不會把某個巫毒教瘋子的胡話印出來當作新聞的。’”她解釋道。從她臉上狡詰的微笑，你知道她嗅到了新聞的氣味。\n"
"頭條駭人聽聞。在九天裡發生了三起殺人事件，這無疑會震驚全城。但你並不覺得這件事會嚇壞整個新奧爾良，你懷疑甚至有些人都不知道這些殺人事件。然而，一個人名勾起了你的興趣。報紙上稱“埃斯普利女士”是巫毒教女祭司，她聲稱有一道邪惡詛咒已在河口扎根。\n"
"“她說的有點道裡，不是嗎？至少看起來是這樣。”明妮說道。你並不敢肯定。如果埃斯普利女士所言非虛，你敢斷言，所謂“狼人詛咒”不會只取三人性命。但詛咒是什麼？狼人？這種事怎麼可能是真的？只有一種辦法能夠找出真相。你披上外衣，前往北區火車站……"

msgid "Set the Curse of the Rougarou encounter set aside, out of play."
msgstr "將<i>狼人詛咒</i>遭遇組放在一邊，位於場外。"

msgid "Sort each of the locations into 4 piles, by trait ([[New Orleans]], [[Riverside]], [[Wilderness]], and [[Unhallowed]]). Randomly choose 1 of these pile s and remove those locations from the game. Randomly chooseanother 1 of these piles and put those locations into play. Set each location in the other 2 piles aside, out of play. Each investigator begins play at a [[Bayou]] location in play."
msgstr "將所有地點根據屬性([[新奧爾良]]、[[河畔]]、[[荒地]]、[[不潔]])分作四堆。隨機選擇其中一堆，並將該堆地點移出遊戲。隨機選擇其中另一堆，並將該堆地點放置入場。將其餘2堆地點的所有地點卡牌放在一邊，位於場外。每位調查員從場上一個[[河口]]地點開始遊戲。"

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Lady Esprit, Bear Trap, and Fishing Net."
msgstr "將下列卡牌放在一邊，位於場外：“埃斯普利女士”、“捕熊陷阱”、“漁網”。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>the Rougarou is destroyed, and the curse is lifted</i>. Remove the Curse of the Rougarou weakness from it's bearers deck. Any one investigator may choose to add Lady Esprit to their deck. This card does not count toward that investigator’s deck size."
msgstr "在冒險日誌中，記錄下“<i>狼人被摧毀且詛咒被移除</i>”。將“狼人詛咒”弱點從承受者的牌堆移除。任意一位調查員可以選擇將“埃斯普利女士”加入其牌組。這張卡牌不計入該調查員的牌組張數。"

msgid "the Rougarou is destroyed, and the curse is lifted."
msgstr "狼人被摧毀且詛咒被移除。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>the Rougarou escaped, and you embraced the curse</i>. The bearer of the Curse of the Rougarou weakness must add Monstrous Transformation to their deck. This card does not count toward that investigator’s deck size."
msgstr "在冒險日誌中，記錄下“<i>狼人逃離且你身負詛咒</i>”。“狼人詛咒”的弱點承受者必須將“獸性變化”加入自己的牌組。這張卡牌不計入該調查員的牌組張數。"

msgid "the Rougarou escaped, and you embraced the curse."
msgstr "狼人逃離且你身負詛咒。"

msgid "the Rougarou continues to haunt the bayou."
msgstr "狼人繼續在河口出沒。"

msgid "Somehow, you manage to make it back to safety before daybreak, resting until late in the afternoon. It isn't until you seek out Lady Esprit the next day that you realize who last night's victim was. With a heavy heart and an unshakable dread, you choose to bury her body instead of contacting the authorities—the less people who delve this deep into the bayou, the better."
msgstr "然而，你成功在天亮之前回到了安全的地方，一直休息到下午。直到你第二天去找埃斯普利女士，你才意識到昨晚的受害者是誰。懷著沉重的心情和揮之不去的恐懼，你沒有聯繫當局，而是自己埋葬了她的屍體——越少人踏入河口深處越好。"

msgid "The creature givs a pitiful wail as dark miry blood oozes from its wounds. By the time its body collapses into the mud, it has transformed back into its original form—the form of a young dark-skinned man, his expression twisted in agony. You bring his body back to Lady Esprit and she works her strange magic, removing the stain of the curse from the land. \"Call on me should you ever need my help,\" the mysterious woman tells you."
msgstr "當黑色的污血從那隻生物的傷口滲出，它發出一聲可憐的哀嚎。它的身體倒在淤泥的時候，它變回了原來的型態——這是個年輕的黑人，表情因痛苦而扭曲。你將他的屍體帶回到埃斯普利女士那兒去，她運用自己神奇的魔力，從這片土地上清除詛咒的污痕。“如果你需要我的幫助，就來找我。”這位神秘女子對你說道。"

msgid "Somehow you have managed to quell the rage and bloodlust of the curse within the creature, and in moments the shape of a young, dark-skinned man stands before you, panting and sweating. He seems to only just now understand everything he's done, and agrees to flee to a secluded corner of the earth where he can harm no one. However, the curse lives on. He sees it in your eyes and grips your arm tightly. \"Don't let it take control,\" he warns. \"I was weak, but you—I can tell you are strong. Control the curse as I could not.\""
msgstr "不知怎麼，你成功地平息了詛咒給這隻生物帶來的憤怒和嗜血慾望，片刻後你面前出現了一個年輕的黑人，氣喘吁吁，汗流浹背。他似乎剛剛才知道自己所作的一切，並且答應逃到地球上與世隔絕的地方去，確保自己不會再傷害任何人。但是，詛咒仍然存在。他從你的眼中發現了詛咒，然後緊緊抓住你的手臂。“別讓詛咒控制住你。”他警告說，“我是個弱者，但你——我看得出你很強。我沒法控制詛咒，但你可以。”"
