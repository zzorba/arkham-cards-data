"Some abilities in <i>Guardians of the Abyss</i> are identified with an <b>Explore</b> action designator. Such abilities are generally used to find new locations to put into play, and are initiated using the “activate” action.\n"
"<b>Explore</b> abilities instruct you to draw the top card of the “exploration deck,” which is a separate deck that will be constructed during this scenario. This deck consists of several single-sided locations and treachery cards."
msgstr ""
"<i>深淵守衛</i>中的某些能力帶有<b>探索</b>行動標識。此類能力通常會通過“啟動”行動發動，用於找出新的地點並將這一地點放置入場。\n"
"<b>探索</b>能力會指示你抽取“探索牌堆”頂上的1張卡牌。探索牌堆是一個獨立的牌堆，在某些冒險的設置階段構成該牌堆，包含多張單面地點卡和詭計卡。"

msgid "Each <b>Explore</b> ability indicates a particular type of location that you are seeking to draw. <b>If a location of that type is drawn, it is put into play, and you move to that location.</b> This is considered a “successful” exploration."
msgstr "每個<b>探索</b>能力會聲明你正在尋找並要抽出的一類地點。<b>抽出一個該類地點後，將其放置入場，然後你移動到該地點。</b>這視為一次“成功”的探索。"

msgid "If any other location is drawn, place it next to the exploration deck, and draw the next card from the exploration deck. Repeat this process until a location of the indicated type is drawn, or a treachery is drawn. After this action has ended, shuffle each location next to the exploration deck back into the exploration deck."
msgstr "如果抽出了其他任何地點，將其放在探索牌堆旁邊，然後抽取探索牌堆的下一張卡牌。重複此流程，直到抽出指定類型的地點，或抽出詭計卡。在此行動結束後，將探索牌堆旁的所有地點混洗並放回探索牌堆。"

msgstr "如果探索牌堆抽完時沒有抽到詭計卡或是探索能力聲明的一類地點，探索結束。這種情況不視為成功或失敗的探索。將探索牌堆旁的所有地點混洗並放回探索牌堆，然後調查員的行動結束。"

msgid "<i>Example: Act 1a—“Search for the Gate” has the following ability: “[action]: <b>Explore</b>. Draw the top card of the exploration deck. If it is a connecting location, put it into play and move to it.” Ursula Downs is at the Expedition Camp and wishes to find a new location to travel to. She spends her first action to explore, drawing the top card of the exploration deck. The card she draws is Desert Oasis. Because Desert Oasis is a location that is not connected to the Expedition Camp, it is placed next to the exploration deck, and Ursula draws the next card in the exploration deck. This time, she draws the Sandstorm treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Desert Oasis that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action. This time, she draws Nile River, which is connected to the Expedition Camp. Her exploration is successful. Nile River is put into play with clues on it equal to its clue value, and Ursula immediately moves from the Expedition Camp to the Nile River.</i>"
msgstr "<i>示例：場景1a—“搜尋入口”有著以下能力：“[action]：<b>探索</b>。抽取探索牌堆頂上的1張卡牌。如果該卡牌是一個連接地點，將它放置入場，並移動到該地點。”厄休拉·唐斯位於探險營地，希望找到並前往一個新的地點。她用自己的第一個行動來探索，抽取探索牌堆頂上的1張卡牌，抽出的卡牌是沙漠綠洲。因為沙漠綠洲不與探險營地連接，將其放在探索牌堆旁邊，然後厄休拉從探索牌堆抽取下一張卡牌。這次她抽出了沙塵暴詭計卡，如常結算並將該卡牌放到遭遇棄牌堆。她的探索失敗了，必須將先前抽出的沙漠綠洲洗回探索牌堆。厄休拉決定用第二個行動來再次探索。這次她抽出了尼羅河，這個地點與探險營地是連接的，探索成功。將尼羅河放置入場，在該卡牌上方放置線索，數量等於其線索值，然後厄休拉立即從探險營地移動到尼羅河。</i>"

"Story cards are a new cardtype in this scenario. These cards serve as an avenue for additional narrative and typically appear as the reverse side of another scenario card. When you are instructed to resolve a story card, simply read its story text and resolve its game text, if any.\n"

msgid "Strength of the Abyss"
msgstr "深淵之力"

msgid "During this scenario, resources on the scenario reference card represent the current strength of the abyss. When you are instructed to add strength to the abyss or remove strength from the abyss, adjust the number of resource tokens on the scenario reference card accordingly. The strength of the abyss has no inherent game effect on its own, though certain encounter card effects may grow stronger or change depending on the current strength of the abyss. Beware—as the abyss grows in strength, so too will the forces set against you. Should it grow too powerful, you will surely fail as Guardians of the Abyss."
msgstr "在本場冒險中，冒險輔助卡上的資源數量表示當前深淵之力的強度。當你受到指示，要增強或減弱深淵之力時，相應地調整冒險輔助卡上的資源標記數目。深淵之力本身沒有效果；但是，某些遭遇卡的效果根據當前的深淵之力，可能會改變或變得更強。要當心——深淵之力越是強大，你要面臨的阻力也會越大。要是它變得過於強大，你就會敗在深淵守衛的手上。"

msgid "“Taken by the Abyss”"
msgstr "“墜入深淵”"

msgid "If an effect states that a defeated investigator or [[Ally]] asset has been <i>“taken by the abyss,”</i> that character has been afflicted by a curse which puts them in a comatose state. When an investigator or [[Ally]] asset is <i>taken by the abyss</i>, first add 1 strength to the abyss. Then, if that card was unique, record in the campaign log that <i>“(card name) was taken by the abyss.”</i> An investigator who has been <i>taken by the abyss</i> is treated as if he or she was killed or driven <b>insane</b>. Additionally, for the remainder of the campaign, players cannot play copies of any unique [[Ally]] asset who has been <i>taken by the abyss.</i>"

I thought nothing of it at first; just a medical curiosity, a mystery the doctors would solve in due time. But then it happened again. And again. More and more, people all across the city started falling into comas. Now it's happening every night. . . And as I write to you, they are taking my husband John to the hospital.</fancy>\n"
