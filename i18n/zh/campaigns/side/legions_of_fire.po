"It’s been several tiring weeks since you have arrived in Rome to commence this disastrous investigation. Tonight, as with every night you can remember, the streets are muted and tense. Residents go about their business quickly, doors locked long before dusk approaches. When questioned, most of the locals give you a cold shoulder and ignore your questions about the series of mass murders that have taken place over the last few months, finding any excuse to avoid the grim topic. You are no closer to finding a motive that would drive a person to sacrificially burn their victims alive.\n"
"Devoid of answers, you have been waiting on this tenuous lead for over an hour now. Nearby rises the colossal edifice of St. Peter’s Basilica, towering over the vast open courtyard of Piazza San Pietro. As you wait, four long chimes ring out from the ancient bells within. You shiver and a feeling of dread runs down your spine. Each tone resonates deeply, as if tearing away shreds of your soul.\n"
"Desperate for a distraction, you recount the details of the letter that has brought you here. An extremist cult. A malevolent god. An appalling ritual. It would seem completely unbelievable to many, but you have seen the cruel underbelly of the universe before. There is truth in these words.\n"
"You are deep in thought when a hand grabs your shoulder. Instinctively, you jump.\n"
"The mysterious figure backs away, then motions for you to follow, marching briskly towards the entrance of St. Peter’s Basilica without turning back.\n"
"Inside, the church is deserted, save for an ocean of candles and scattered photographs of those whose deaths you have failed to prevent. You walk a little faster, your footsteps resonating raucously, your heartbeat pounding in your ears. With the pictures finally out of sight, you follow the figure in front of you through a small clerical side door.\n"
"The room you enter is cramped and overflowing with parchment. The figure offers you a seat, then pulls back his hood to reveal a shaved head and a pale, almost sickly face. He sits slowly and quietly, never losing sight of the exit behind you. You make as if to ask a question, but he quickly silences you. “I have little time for questions. I hold the answers you seek, but I have paid a heavy price for them”. He winces and you notice for the first time the dried specks of blood around his mouth.\n"
"“The homicides that you have been investigating were carried out by former priests and bishops who have been corrupted by a promise of rapture. This promise is a lie… Something worse is coming.” His voice is less than a whisper as he recounts a tale of similar mass killings unfolding in ancient Rome during the sickening days of Emperor Nero’s reign. He tells you of how those rituals brought forth malicious flames controlled by an immortal being that sought to turn the world into an ashen wasteland. “Once it has risen, Ignis will be the harbinger of humanity’s destruction.” As you listen to the story being woven, you hear a distant set of footsteps.\n"
"“Somehow, the early church managed to quell the infernal blaze before the ritual was completed, safeguarding humanity from utter annihilation. I sought the knowledge to do the same, but my own quest has been cut short, and there is no antidote for what now afflicts me.” He sighs deeply, and you can hear the death rattle as he breathes.\n"
"You ponder the man’s words, digesting them as one would an ill-prepared meal. The figure before you appears barely conscious. How much can you trust the words of a man in such a state? The figure breaks the stalemate again. “The records that remain will be in the Vatican Archives. You should search there first. Go. Now. Before they realise what I’ve told you.” His life force spent, the man gently sinks onto the desk, his breathing faint and laboured. You reach over to try and lift him, but he uses the last of his strength to push you away. “Leave… you must… quickly.” Slowly, a dribble of blood pools in the crook of his nose. “Search out Dr… Gentile.”\n"
"Outside, a great army of footsteps echoes louder and louder. You turn to face the door. Suddenly, the four dreadful chimes ring out again, playing a discordant symphony. You can feel terror scurrying to the surface of your mind. Your throat constricts. Looking back, you realise the man in front of you is lifeless, a fate you plan to avoid. If you are going to act, you must do it now. You try to swallow your fear and make your way back into the basilica."

Gently, you try to move your leg but a feeling akin to someone running glass shards along your skin quickly changes your mind. Somewhere nearby, the four long discordant chimes start once again.

As you stand before the wreckage, you consider what you have lost. After a great sigh, you turn and commence the long walk back towards the train station."
