"You’ve spent your entire life reading. As a child, it was but a simple interest in harmless stories. Grisly stories, to be sure, but harmless nonetheless. Your fascination with horror and the macabre earned you the nickname “Spooks” among your friends and classmates. But as you grew, so too did this fascination, until it bordered on obsession. Your appetite for horror evolved from mystery and make-believe to something more. Something <i>real</i>.\n"
"When you discovered John Dee’s translation of The Necronomicon, you knew you’d finally found the true horror you had been secretly yearning for. If only you’d known what would be in store for you once you’d read that dreadful tome. You would have locked it back up in Henry Armitage’s restricted collection in the Orne Library and never opened it again.\n"
"Or so you like to think. But even you cannot doubt the allure of the <i>Kitab al-Azif</i>. The Book of the Dead. That is why, when Dr. Armitage summoned you to the Orne Library, the dread in your bones predicted precisely what had occurred.\n"
"“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” Dr. Armitage says as he surveys the destruction. The entire restricted collection is in tattered disarray. The Necronomicon lies open on a nearby table, its metal clasps broken apart. You run your fingers along its leathery, skin-like pages. Your eyes flit along the words in a familiar dance:\n"
"<center><i>“They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness.”</i></center>\n"
"Your throat tightens as you realize what must have occurred. Something has been unleashed, and you are the only one who can figure out how to stop it…"

"你一輩子都在讀書。小時候，只是簡單地沉浸在無害的故事之中。確切地說，儘管故事很嚇人，卻是無害的。你對恐怖和驚悚的迷戀使你在朋友和同學中贏得了“嚇人精”的綽號。但是隨著你的年齡增長，這種迷戀也跟著成長，漸漸地變成了一種痴迷。神秘和虛構開始無法滿足你對恐怖的胃口，你渴望更<i>真實</i>的東西。\n"
"當你發現約翰·迪伊的《死靈之書》譯本時，你知道自己終於找到了一直暗暗渴望的真正恐怖。只要你讀完這本可怕的書，你就會知道有什麼正在等待著你。然後你就會將它深鎖在奧恩圖書館的亨利·阿米蒂奇的禁忌藏書區，永遠不再打開。\n"
"也許，這只是你喜歡的幻想。然而你也無法抗拒《死靈之書》—亡者的典籍—的魅力。這就是為什麼當阿米蒂奇博士召喚你到奧恩圖書館時，你所感到的刺骨恐懼精確地預測了發生了什麼事。\n"
"「我不知道怎麼會發生這種事，」阿米蒂奇博士在調查破壞時說道。整個禁忌收藏都變得亂七八糟。《死靈之書》躺在附近的桌子上，書上的金屬扣環斷裂。你的手指滑過皮革般、有著皮膚觸感的書頁。你的眼睛隨著每個字跳動，像是跳著一支熟悉的舞蹈：\n"
"<center><i>“他們走在偏僻的地方，看不見且汙穢，聖言在這裡被道出，儀式在他們的季節裡喧囂。狂風鼓譟著他們的聲音，大地低語著他們的意識。”</i></center>\n"
"當你意識到將要需發生的事情時，你的喉嚨一緊。有什麼東西已經被釋放了，而你是唯一知道該如何阻止它的人……"
