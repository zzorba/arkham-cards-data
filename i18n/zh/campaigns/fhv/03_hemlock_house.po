"“Oh, please, it’s not haunted.” Theo smiles nonchalantly as he pulls his truck to a stop in front of the towering, shingle style manor. “Old Gideon says a lot of things about this place. But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people,” he laughs. “I’m sure there’s something to it. Rumor is, there’s some kinda infestation in there. Rats, probably. Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. It’s an old house, y’know? Lots of nooks in the walls, places for them to hide. Brother William asked Ms. Park to find and repair ‘em, clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls, but she hasn’t gotten around to it yet. I still got all those supplies in my truck, if you feel like helping out.”\n"
"You unload several planks of wood, a box of tools, and a bucket of some foul- smelling chemical mixture from the back of Theo’s truck. As he drives off, you stare up at the crumbling manor. There is something crooked and unsettling in the arrangement of its windows, the slant of its gambrel roofs. The house’s previous grandeur has not set right with the landscape, perhaps by some crack in its foundation—or, if the rumors are right, whatever lives within its walls."

"“喔拜託，這裡沒有鬧鬼啦。”西奧漫不經心地微笑，他將卡車停在一棟高聳的瓦格式大宅外。“老吉迪恩總是說這裡有問題，但你們要知道，他也相信有個海底王國，裡面還住滿了魚人！”西奧大笑著說。“不過我確定裡面的確有什麼東西，傳聞說裡面有些動靜，八成是老鼠，也有可能是森林裡的野生動物把這裡當作避難所。你們懂的，這裡很老舊了，牆壁裡都是洞，牠們有很多地方躲。威廉弟兄有請朴小姐來修理，順便把住在牆壁裡的東西趕走，但她還沒有時間來處理。我把修理的材料帶上了，你們應該用得著。”\n"
"你們從西奧的卡車上卸下幾塊長木板、一箱工具，還有一桶刺鼻的化學混合物。他駕車離開，你們轉身看著這座搖搖欲墜的大宅，窗戶的排列方式、層疊式屋頂的傾斜角度，整棟房子的格局散發出一種令人不適的躁動感。這棟曾經宏偉的大宅與周遭的地形有點格格不入，也許是地基出現了裂痕，又或許，如果傳言屬實，是由於住在牆壁中的生物，不管牠們到底是什麼。"

"The rear wheels of Theo’s truck spit up mud as it putters toward the cape, where the shingle style manor towers atop a ruinous hill. “There it is,” Theo says, pointing at the silhouette of the manor, barely visible through the torrent of rain beating down on the windshield. “Old Gideon says a lot of things about this place. But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people,” He laughs. “I’m sure there’s something to it. Rumor is, there’s some kinda infestation in there. Rats, probably. Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. It’s an old house, y’know? Lots of nooks in the walls, places for them to hide. Gotta be even worse with all this rain.”\n"
"Having seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle, you know better than to assume the house’s other inhabitants to be mere rats or raccoons. You ask Theo what Mr. Hemlock wants done to the place, which elicits a brief chuckle. “He asked Ms. Park to repair the place and clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls. They’re both there right now, I think, if you wanna help out or chat with them. Can’t believe he still thinks the place is salvageable, but hey, who am I to judge?”\n"
"Theo drops you off in front of the crumbling manor so you don’t have to plod through mud and rain. You shudder as you glance up at its crooked frame. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its gambrel roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls."

"西奧的卡車濺起一陣泥巴，你們正開往海峽，有座瓦格式大宅聳立在前方荒廢的山丘上。“就是那裡。”西奧指著前方說，滂沱大雨擊打在擋風玻璃上，你們很勉強才看見宅邸的輪廓。“老吉迪恩總是說這裡有問題，但你們要知道，他也相信有個海底王國，裡面還住滿了魚人！”西奧大笑著說。“不過我確定裡面的確有什麼東西，傳聞說裡面有些動靜，八成是老鼠，也有可能是森林裡的野生動物把這裡當作避難所。你們懂的，這裡很老舊了，牆壁裡都是洞，牠們有很多地方躲。這麼大的雨可能會讓情況更糟。”\n"
"與赫姆拉克島上潛藏的恐怖正面衝突過，你們合理推斷棲息在大宅中的，絕對不是老鼠或浣熊這麼簡單。你們問西奧，赫姆拉克先生是想要怎麼處理這棟宅邸，他輕笑著說：“他請朴小姐幫忙修理，順便把藏在牆壁裡的東西趕出來。如果你們想幫忙或跟他們聊聊，我想他們兩個現在應該都在那了。我不敢相信他居然還覺得這裡能修好，不過，嘿，我算哪根蔥啊。”\n"
"西奧將你們放在搖搖欲墜的大宅門口，你們才不必在大雨中走過泥濘的道路。大宅令人不適的外觀讓你們打了一個冷顫，窗戶的排列方式、層疊式屋頂的傾斜角度，整棟房子的格局散發出一種深沉的躁動感。不管這裡曾經有多氣派輝煌，都已經是很久以前的事了。它現在只剩一具空殼，而你們懷疑造成這一切的原因仍棲息在斷垣殘壁中。"

"“Considering what Brother William was prattling on about last night at the dance? Yeah, maybe it is haunted. I dunno.” Theo sighs as his truck pulls to a stop in front of the towering, shingle style manor. Dark clouds loom over its gambrel roofs, its frame crooked and misshapen. Its attic truss is burnt almost to the frame, its outer wall exposed to the elements by extensive fire damage. “Old Gideon says a lot of things about this place. But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people. Still...” Theo sighs, shaking his head. “Maybe there is something to it all. I thought if there was an infestation, it was probably rats, y’know? Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. But Brother William looked downright terrified when he came back into town yesterday. Who knows?”\n"
"You ask Theo what Mr. Hemlock was doing here—perhaps you can help figure out what’s wrong with the place. “Last I checked, he asked Ms. Park to repair the place and clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls. That was a couple days ago. Ms. Park’s still here, but after yesterday I don’t think Brother William’s gonna be venturing anywhere near this place until it’s cleaned up.”\n"
" You point the fire damage out to Theo, who gives a whistle in response. “Yeah, that’s new. I did hear some pretty close thunder during that storm last night. Wouldn’t be surprised if that was from lightning. Lucky the rain must’ve put the fire out.” You wonder if it was in fact fortune that kept the old manor standing, or something else entirely. As if in response to your ruminations, something slithers just out of view from the exposed floor of the attic. You ask Theo if he saw it, but he only shrugs. “Saw what? You don’t plan on heading up there, do you? Be careful. This place was decrepit even before the storm.” He turns the ignition off and gets out of the truck, joining you under the awning of the manor’s front porch. “I’ll come with, ok? I won’t go all the way up there, but just in case something happens, I’ll be here.”\n"
"You nod. Having seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle, you know better than to assume the house’s other inhabitants to be mere rats or raccoons. It might be nice having Theo and his truck on hand for a swift exit. Taking in a deep breath, you glance once more at the manor’s crooked frame. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls.\n"
"Upon entering the house, you immediately climb its inner staircase up to the attic, leaving Theo downstairs. Scarred by fire damage and partially exposed to the wind, the decrepit bedroom bears no trace of whatever creature you saw from below. With each of your steps, the old building groans precariously. You cannot help but wonder if it is in fact the rumbling of an empty stomach..."

"“昨晚舞會的時候，威廉弟兄一直在喃喃自語這裡的事，也許這裡真的鬧鬼了，我不確定。”西奧嘆了口氣，在一棟高聳的瓦格式大宅前停下卡車。黑雲籠罩在層疊式屋頂上，宅邸外型扭曲且令人感到不適，閣樓突出的部分燒到只剩骨架，外牆處處都有大片燒焦的痕跡。“老吉迪恩總是說這裡有問題，但你們要知道，他也相信有個海底王國，裡面還住滿了魚人。可是……”西奧嘆氣，搖著頭繼續說：“也許真的有什麼東西，我之前以為裡面的動靜八成是因為老鼠，你們懂的，也有可能是森林裡的野生動物把這裡當作避難所。但在威廉弟兄昨天從這裡回到鎮上後，他看起來徹底嚇壞了。誰知道呢？”\n"
"你們詢問赫姆拉克先生在這裡做什麼，也許你們可以幫忙找出這裡發生了什麼事。“據我所知，他請朴小姐修理這裡，同時趕走躲在牆壁裡的東西，不管牠們是什麼。那是幾天前的事了。朴小姐還在這裡，但我想經過昨天的事後，在這裡被清理乾淨前，威廉弟兄都不會再靠近這了。”\n"
"你們指著火燒的痕跡給西奧看，他吹了個口哨說：“嗯，真新奇。我聽說昨晚的暴風雨中有幾道雷打得很近，如果是雷電造成的我也不意外，還好大雨順便把火撲滅了。”你們懷疑到底是運氣保住了大宅，還是完全無關的其他東西。就像在回應你們的猜測，一道影子從閣樓凸出的地板上一閃即逝，你們問西奧有沒有看見，但他只是聳聳肩：“看到什麼？你們不是真的要上去對吧？小心點，這地方在暴風雨來前就已經很脆弱了。”他將卡車熄火，跳下車，走到宅邸的前廊下與你們會合。“我一起去，可以吧？我不會陪你們上去，但萬一出了什麼事，我會在這。”\n"
"與赫姆拉克島上潛藏的恐怖正面衝突過，你們合理推斷棲息在大宅中的，絕對不是老鼠或浣熊這麼簡單。有個退路總是好的，有西奧跟他的卡車，你們可以快速撤離這裡，你們深吸一口氣，看了大宅令人不適的外觀最後一眼，窗戶的排列方式、層疊式屋頂的傾斜角度，整棟房子的格局散發出一種深沉的躁動感。不管這裡曾經有多氣派輝煌，都已經是很久以前的事了。它現在只剩一具空殼，而你們懷疑造成這一切的原因仍棲息在斷垣殘壁中。\n"
"進入屋內，你們逕直爬上樓梯前往閣樓，將西奧留在樓下。破碎的臥房有火焰灼燒的痕跡，部分還暴露在風雨中，但沒有其他生物的蹤跡。隨著你們的腳步，老舊的建築發出隨時會崩塌的呻吟，但你們懷疑其實聲音也許是從你們翻攪的空腹中傳出的……。"

"Theo’s truck slows to a halt as you pull up in front of the towering, shingle style manor. From what you’ve been told, the old Hemlock House is infested with something or other—what exactly is a matter of some debate. Before lending you his truck for the night, Theo made mention of rats in the walls, or potentially wild animals taking refuge from the woods, not to mention the storm brewing on the horizon. But you’re not so sure. After all, you’ve already seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle—you know better than to assume mere rats or raccoons to be the issue.\n"
"Approaching the crumbling manor, you find a stockpile of supplies tucked away near its entrance: several planks of wood, a box of tools, and a bucket of some foul-smelling chemical mixture. According to Theo, Mr. Hemlock had asked Judith to try to fix the place up and clear out whatever was infesting its walls. Seems like she hasn’t gotten very far yet. You look up at the house’s crooked frame, set against a backdrop of dark stormclouds. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its gambrel roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls."

msgid "William paces back and forth, wincing at every creak of the old house. You ask him if everything is ok, eliciting a deep sigh from the melancholy heir. “Oh, yes, everything is jake. Judith has run off and left me here alone, I can’t find my mother’s doll anywhere, and my childhood home is crumbling before my very eyes,” he says bitterly. “Help me find Judith, won’t you? That bearcat is supposed to be protecting me and helping me clean this place up.” He follows you close behind, eyes darting from shadow to shadow as the house growls angrily."
msgstr "威廉來回踱步，看似對老房子的每道裂痕都十分懼怕。你詢問他是否一切安好，引起這位悶悶不樂的赫姆拉克末裔一陣嘆息：“喔，一切再好不過了。茱蒂絲跑了，留我一個人；我找不到母親的娃娃；還有我兒時的家無時無刻都在崩壞。除此之外再好不過了。”他語帶苦澀說著。“幫我找到茱蒂絲，好嗎？那個勇敢的小姐應該要保護我，幫我把這裡清理乾淨的。”他緊緊跟著你，在屋子忿恨的嚎叫聲中，他的視線在每道陰影之間來回游移。"

msgid "“Finally,” William says as you enter the room where Judith stands, arms crossed. “Where have you been? I hired you because I needed your help, not to stomp around my childhood home brooding.” The two square off, tension thick in the air..."
msgstr "“終於。”當你們走進房間時，威廉雙手抱胸對茱蒂絲說到。“妳跑去哪了？我雇用妳是來幫忙的，不是叫妳無所事事在我的老家裡四處遊蕩的。”兩個人劍拔弩張的看著對方，氣氛有點緊繃……。"

msgid "You pull an old, yellowed map from a book and hold it up to Gideon. “Yes!” He exclaims, taking it from your hands and looking it over. “This is exactly what I was looking for. Thankee kindly!”"
msgstr "你從書中拿出一張老舊泛黃的地圖，遞給吉迪恩。“沒錯！”他大喊，從你手中將地圖抽走並檢視起來。“這就是我在找的，謝啦！”"

msgid "Gideon barely looks up from a musty book as you approach. “I don’t suppose ye’ve ever heard the story of the Delilah?” You tell him no, but you think you’re about to. He laughs. “The Delilah was a fishing vessel that mapped this island years ago.” He grabs another book as he rambles on about not only the Delilah, but also three other tangential stories. At length, you glean that the old man is looking for a map somewhere in the parlor."
msgstr "吉迪恩盯著一本發霉的書本，即使你靠近也幾乎沒抬頭看你。“我想你應該沒聽過狄萊拉號的故事吧？”你回答沒有，但心想他應該馬上就會開始講了。他大笑著說：“狄萊拉號是一條漁船，好幾年前它繪製了這座島的地圖。”他邊拿起另一本書，邊喋喋不休地說著關於狄萊拉號，還有另外三個能跟這艘船扯上一些關係的故事。在冗長的故事中，你終於聽出老人要找的是一張地圖，就在這個客廳裡。"

msgid "You may cancel the next predation that would take place. Remember “you are helping Gideon.” An investigator may trigger this codex again."
msgstr "你可以取消下次掠食。請記住“你正在幫助吉迪恩”。任意一位調查員可以再次觸發此聖典。"

msgid "“Rats. ‘Rats,’ he said!” Judith scoffs. “Rats, my ass...” she trails off into grumbles, then faces you with a stern expression. “This place is a cesspool. There’s something in the walls that I swear is following me.” Any fear within her seems to have settled into anger. “It’s no wonder he didn’t want to come back with me today. There’s no ‘legacy’ here. Just a bunch of ugly furniture, and whatever creature has taken up residence.” You ask what she thinks should be done. “It’s too dangerous to be left alone as it is.” She may be right—it would surely upset William, but left as is, this house is a danger to him and the rest of Hemlock Isle."
msgstr "“老鼠，他說只是老鼠！”茱蒂絲歇斯底里的叫喊著，“老鼠個鬼……。”當她終於停止抱怨，她帶著嚴肅的表情面向你說：“這地方根本是邪惡的巢穴，我發誓牆壁裡有什麼東西在跟著我。”她恐懼的情緒似乎全都轉換成了怒氣。“難怪今天他不願意跟我過來。這裡根本沒有什麼‘遺產’，只有醜不啦嘰的家具，還有佔據這棟房子的生物，不管牠們是什麼鬼東西。”你問她現在應該怎麼做。“不能放任它繼續存在，太危險了。”茱蒂絲也許是對的，雖然威廉一定會生氣，但放任這棟屋子不管，無論對他還是鐵杉谷的居民們都是一個威脅。"

msgid "Take control of Judith Park. Remember that “Judith is remodeling.”"
msgstr "控制茱蒂絲．朴。請記住“茱蒂絲正在拆毀房屋。”"

msgid "“There you are,” Judith struts to where William stands daydreaming. He snaps out of his reverie as she approaches, finger pointed at his chest. “You said this place had a rat problem, not...not this,” she says, gesturing vaguely. The two square off, tension thick in the air..."
msgstr "“找到你了。”茱蒂絲氣沖沖地走向正在神遊的威廉，用手指著他的胸膛，這時候他才終於清醒過來。茱蒂絲歇斯底里地指著周遭說：“你說這個地方有鼠患，但這個……這個根本不是老鼠的問題！”兩個人劍拔弩張的看著對方，氣氛有點緊繃……。"

msgid "Judith rolls her eyes as you ask her what she’s doing here. “William was here yesterday, but he got creeped out, so he asked me to come with him today to babysit him. Then he ran upstairs to ‘ponder his legacy’ and ‘ruminate upon his forebears’ or whatever nonsense.” She shakes her head. “Look, between you and me, this place is a wreck. Let’s find William, I’ll talk to him, and leave this place to rot. You with me?”"
msgstr "當你問茱蒂絲在做什麼時，她翻了個白眼後說：“威廉昨天來過，然後嚇得跑走了，所以他今天叫我一起來，當他的褓母。然後他就跑上樓，說要去‘思考他留下的遺產’和‘追尋他的先輩’，之類莫名其妙的事。”她無奈的搖頭。“跟你說，別告訴別人，這地方根本就是一片廢墟。我們去找威廉，我會說服他，然後我們就離開，讓這裡自生自滅。你覺得怎麼樣？”"

Protect you,” he puts on a fake swagger as he helps you to your feet."
msgstr "“不不不不不！”在西奧從走廊上跑來前，你就已經聽見他的叫聲。他衝向你，差點把你給撞倒。“呼，我還以為你……”他轉頭望向後方，走廊一片死寂。“看起來你需要一點保護。別擔心，我可以，呃，保護你。”他邊虛張聲勢，邊扶著你站穩腳步。"
