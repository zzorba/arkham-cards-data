msgid "Scenario: The Silent Heath"
msgstr "冒險：靜寂荒原"

msgid "You step out of Theo’s truck accompanied by Leah Atwood and look up at Hemlock Isle’s highest point. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill with the Vale’s cook. “There’s a reason folks don’t live here anymore. Watch yourself up here. I don’t know what lives in the caves, and I don’t intend to find out,” she says. As if in response, a strong wind blows up clouds of white ash."
msgstr "你們從西奧的卡車上下來，與你們同行的還有莉亞．阿特伍德。你們看向赫姆拉克島的最高點，狹窄的小徑一路蜿蜒而上，沒入一片被柔軟白沙般的灰燼所覆蓋的原野。黑色的岩石錯落在山丘頂端，像一排參差不齊的牙齒，你們與這位谷地的廚師一起走上山坡時，周遭瀰漫著滲人的寂靜。莉亞開口說：“人們不再生活在這裡是有原因的，小心一點，我不知道那些山洞裡住著什麼東西，也沒興趣知道。”就像是要回應他的話一般，一陣強風颳來，帶起了一縷白色的煙塵。"

"You step out of Theo’s truck into the pouring rain, accompanied by Dr. Marquez. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill with the professor, who wears a bright yellow and blue poncho. “If the locals are to be believed, we want to head this way,” she points up the hillside to a glimmering orchard. After hiking the steep incline, the professor lets out a gasp.\n"
"Rows of crystalline trees shimmer in the light. A crack of lightning from the southern clouds refracts a band of gorgeous, prismatic radiance through hanging apples and knotted glass trunks. Although beautiful, you can’t help but feel an anxious pang: the trees are wondrous, but they are long dead, frozen in time. Dr. Marquez begins chipping away at a young sapling with a hammer and chisel. “Fan out and explore the ruins. Leah warned me to keep clear of the ants, whatever that means. Don’t kick any anthills, I guess.” she says, already engrossed in her work."

"你們從西奧的卡車上下來，踏入滂沱的大雨中，馬爾克斯博士也加入了你們的行列。你們看向赫姆拉克島的最高點，狹窄的小徑一路蜿蜒而上，沒入一片被柔軟白沙般的灰燼所覆蓋的原野。黑色的岩石錯落在山丘頂端，像一排參差不齊的牙齒，你們與教授一起走上山坡時，周遭瀰漫著滲人的寂靜，身著亮黃色與藍色雨衣的教授開口說：“如果當地人的話可信，我們應該走這邊。”她指向山丘邊一座正在發光的果園。在攀登越過陡峭的山坡後，教授喘了一大口氣。\n"
"數排水晶化的樹木發出閃爍的微光，南方的雨雲打出一道閃電，光芒反射在高掛樹梢的果實與樹幹的木瘤上，散發出璀璨絢麗的稜光。即使眼前的景象光彩奪目，你們還是不免感到一絲焦躁的疑慮：這些樹木的確是一大奇觀，但它們已經死亡很久了，被凍結了時間。\n"
"馬爾克斯博士拿出槌子跟鑿子，開始在一棵小樹苗上採取樣本。“分頭行動，探索這片遺跡。莉亞警告我要離螞蟻遠一點，不知道她是什麼意思，不要踩到到蟻窩吧，我猜。”她說完後就埋頭專注在她手邊的工作。"

msgid "You step out of Theo’s truck and look up at Hemlock Isle’s highest point. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill and spot a robed figure standing on a jutting rock, staring down at Hemlock Isle. You recognize the figure as Mother Rachel as you draw closer. She nods as if to acknowledge your presence, then spreads her arms in an exultant pose. The sky overhead shimmers with a band of strange colors."

msgid "You reach the old Pearl Estate and stop yourself from walking into the yawning dark chasm in front of the dilapidated house. A shattered rooftop at the northern end of the estate tells a story of some violent impact: judging by the scattered boards, something shot out of the interior with the force of a cannonball. As you survey the ruins, you wonder what awful catastrophe befell the Pearl family. A skittering black shadow flits at the edge of your vision. When you turn to look, it has gone."
msgstr "你們來到珍珠莊園，在破舊宅邸如血盆大口般黑暗的裂縫前停下腳步。宅邸北邊的屋頂碎裂，顯示這裡曾經受到劇烈的衝擊。從四散的碎片來看，有東西從建物內部炸了出來，力道堪比加農砲的砲彈。你們邊探查廢墟，邊疑惑到底降臨到帕洛一家頭上的是多大的一場災難。突然有道黑影從你們的視野邊緣一閃而過，但回頭時它早已消失了。"

Perhaps the local creatures use the salt in this chamber as a natural preservative. A pantry, of sorts."

At midnight, I awoke to the uncanny feeling of being watched, and when I opened my eyes, I saw a pale sphere of watery light in the corner of my room, dancing like something in a faery story. As soon as I laid eyes on it, the thing flew out the window, and I followed it out into the orchard. What I saw is something I can only describe as a miracle: A hundred more faery lights danced in the orchard. As I watched the lights, they grew brighter, and I felt almost as though I was flying. A heady bliss took over my mind, and I felt different, somehow. As if there were another me—five other me’s—beating within my chest. And as I looked out at the trees, I saw myself in them, too. In all of this. Strong and thick with knotted skin and branches for arms. I saw myself, my place, in all of creation. And all of my fears—for Ezra, for the mine, for our health—melted away. I knew only joy. Such joy!\n"
