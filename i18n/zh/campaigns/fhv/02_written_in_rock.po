"The path to North Point Mine runs through a narrow ravine in the heart of Pearl Ridge. With little to go on, you asked around the Vale for more information about the mine, but all you could gather were several conflicting accounts. People have gone missing in the mines recently, although the mining operation is purportedly shut down. The lichens and moss are supposedly nutritious, but some are lethal? Nobody explained why the mine shut down in the first place, either.\n"
"The path ends at the mouth of a yawning cave. Following an old rail track in, you find heaps of abandoned equipment overgrown with bright yellow fungi. The fungus looks far from edible, and emits a putrescent stench. Eventually, the tunnel opens into a massive cavern filled with luminescent mushrooms and towering crystal formations. The ground shifts with a slight tremor, followed by an echoing cry from deeper in the mine. Steeling yourself, you trek deeper into the cave. At the very least, Dr. Marquez will want samples of the strange overgrowth on the rusted equipment."

"你們知道前往北角礦坑的路要穿越珍珠山脈中央的一道狹窄的山溝，但除此之外沒有其他線索。你們只好在谷地中四處詢問更多關於礦坑的消息，但蒐集到的訊息似乎相互矛盾。據傳這座礦坑已經關閉，但最近又傳出有人在其中失蹤；有些消息說裡面的地衣跟苔癬具有營養價值，但也有人說它們含有劇毒？最奇怪的是關於那座礦坑關閉的原因，沒有人知道，或只是不願提起。\n"
"你們朝著礦坑方向前進，最後來到一個巨口般的山洞前。你們沿著老舊的鐵道進入洞口，周圍四散著廢棄的裝備，亮黃色的菌菇生長其上，將其完全覆蓋。這些菌菇看起來不適合食用，同時散發出腐臭的氣息。終於狹窄的隧道引領你們來到一座寬廣的洞穴，四處長滿了發光的蘑菇以及高聳的水晶結構體。地面發出微微的震動，隨之一陣哭聲從礦洞深處迴盪而來，你們安撫住自己的不安，向更深處前進。至少，對於那些在生鏽工具上不自然生長的蕈菇，馬爾克斯博士一定會想要一些樣本。"
