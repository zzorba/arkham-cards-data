"“I should have known better than to let that little twit go off on his own. I swear on his precious little grave, if I find that boy plucking violets and reciting poetry, I will have him expelled,” Dr. Marquez almost spits the words as she leads you to one of the Vale’s supply sheds. Searching the village yielded no results: Just a pile of books and Bertie’s leather satchel in his room at the boarding house. Nobody seems to have seen him since the morning.\n"
"The professor opens the rickety shed and grabs an old barn lantern from an iron hook. “Look for oil,” she says gruffly. You mention the locals’ warning against going out at night, and the professor raps her cane on an empty oilcan. “All the more reason to find Bertie.”\n"
"A long shadow falls across you both, and you turn to see Mother Rachel silhouetted against the sunset. “You all left so quickly after dinner. Is there something I can help you find?”"

"“我早該知道不能讓那個臭小子自己行動，我對天發誓，如果被我抓到他是跑去哪裡摘花或吟詩，我一定會開除他。”馬爾克斯博士憤恨的說著，一邊帶著你走向村莊存放物資的棚屋。你們在村莊中的搜尋一無所獲，只在旅店中找到柏蒂留下的一堆書籍跟他的皮製側背包。從早上開始就沒有人再見過柏蒂。\n"
"教授打開破舊的棚屋，從牆上的鐵鉤拿下一盞舊提燈，氣沖沖地說：“找燈油。”你提起當地人的警告，最好不要在晚上出去，教授一邊用拐杖敲打著空的燈油罐一邊說：“那我們更應該把柏蒂找回來。”\n"

"As you share the dire situation, the elderly woman nods gravely. “As I said when you arrived in the Vale, we do not venture out at night. However, your friend will likely not survive the night if left alone.” She eyes Dr. Marquez’s old lantern. “Please, take my lantern. Stay in the light, and you will find the way much safer.” She leads you to the edge of the forest as the sun sets. The forest air is unnaturally thick, and you find it hard to breathe, but you follow the matron nonetheless. Eventually, Mother Rachel leads you to a broad, open field and gestures to the tenebrous shadows. “From here, you take your lives into your own hands. The people of the Vale will pray for your safe return.”\n"
"Hazy lights dance above the meadow’s yarrow and asters. Mother Rachel points into the murky abyss. “If all else fails, return to the fireflies.”"

"你向她解釋目前嚴峻的狀況，年長的女士面色凝重的點了點頭：“你們抵達谷地時我就說過，我們不會在晚上出去冒險。不過，如果真的放任你們的朋友不管的話，他很可能沒辦法活下來。”她看向馬爾克斯博士手上的舊提燈。“帶著我的提燈去吧，待在光明之中會安全的多。”她引領你們來到森林的邊緣，身後的夕陽正在逐漸消失。森林中的空氣異常凝重，儘管你感到呼吸困難，但仍緊緊跟著這位修女長。最後，她帶領你們來到一片廣闊的林間空地，然後指向前方黑暗的陰影：“從這裡開始，你們的命運就掌握在自己手中了，谷地的人民會為你們祈禱，希望你們能安全歸來。”\n"

"Mother Rachel nods along to your paper-thin story. “I see. Understand that the Vale is here to help. I wish you the best on your survey.” After more polite conversation, the matron leaves you and Dr. Marquez to scour the shed. Finally, you find a chipped mason jar with just a fifth of oil. “We can make it if we portion every bit,” the professor says. You follow the dim lantern light into the maw of gnarled trees toward a quiet stream, then further up and further into the dark.\n"
"Eventually, you reach a collapsed bridge and overgrown cobblestones in the ruins of an old village. The trees overhead rustle. “Something’s there,” Dr. Marquez raises her lantern. A pair of beady eyes reflect the light, but quickly vanish in the murk.\n"
"“Watch yourself and keep close. There’s no telling what’s out here.”"

"瑞秋主母聽著你漏洞百出的說詞，點著頭說：“我懂了，請明白谷地隨時都願意伸出援手，祝你們調查順利。”她禮貌地寒暄了幾句後就離開了。你們繼續搜索棚屋，終於找到一個缺口的石罐，裡面還剩少量的燈油。“如果謹慎分配的話應該夠用了。”教授開口說。你們跟著提燈昏暗的光線走進粗獷森林的巨口中，找到了一條安靜的小溪，接著順流而上，深入黑暗中。\n"
"最終你們抵了一座坍塌的橋梁和一座廢棄的村莊遺址，作為建材的鵝卵石四散一地。你們頭頂上的樹葉發出沙沙的聲響，馬爾克斯博士舉起提燈說：“有東西在這裡。”突然，提燈的光芒反射在一雙晶亮的眼睛上，接著瞬間又消失在黑暗中。\n"

"Long, spindly branches stretch like grasping hands from the thick canopy overhead. You feel light-headed as strange whispers resound from deep in the surrounding dark. Summoning all your strength, you stagger to the edge of a black lake. The waxing moon is perfectly reflected on the surface of the water, distorted by oily, iridescent whisps of a strange color. Across the lake, a figure stands outlined in the mist. You call out to it, and it moves slowly toward you, over the water. As it approaches, all you can see of its face is a wide, rictus grin.\n"

The sight of the brilliant carpet of blue and white nearly takes your breath away after the oppressive darkness. Perhaps it is just your tired mind, but the heather and flowers seem to pulse. “Look,” Bertie points with a trembling hand. A dozen luminous stalks rise like floating lamps over the meadow, glimmering in the moonlight. “I feel almost as though we are walking amidst the cosmos. That each of us is a little god.” He plucks a glowing bud from its stalk. “And each of these, an even smaller star.”\n"

I’m so sorry I caused you so much trouble. Say a word for me back in the Vale, will you?” Before you can intervene, Bertie snatches the lantern out of your hands and shouts into the darkness: “Come on, you ugly git!”\n"
"The bear roars in response. Glowing blue spores scatter in the darkness around it, wreathing the creature in pale blue light. Bertie lets out a brave yell in response and barrels toward it. Realizing the young man’s sacrifice, you take advantage of the distraction to slip away and get to safety."

"濃密的樹冠彷彿正在逼近，充滿無數的眼睛還有昆蟲振翅的嗡嗡聲。你們走進一個被月光照亮的小空地，隨即聽見一聲熟悉的劇烈咳嗽：熊怪從身後的黑暗中出現了，一邊咆哮，一邊逼近。柏蒂睜大眼睛看著你，眼神清澈：“都是我的錯，我很抱歉對你造成這麼多麻煩。等你回到谷地，幫我說些好話，好嗎？”在你來得及阻止前，他一把奪過你手上的提燈，衝入黑暗中大喊著：“來啊，你這個醜陋的混蛋！”\n"
"熊怪用怒吼回應他，發光的藍色孢子散落在他四周，將牠包裹在純藍色的光芒中。柏蒂發出一聲勇敢的吆喝，朝牠衝過去。你意識到這個年輕人準備犧牲自己，你抓緊怪物分心的機會，逃出生天。"

Local flora and fauna have evolved highly specialized behavior patterns after dark, likely dictated by extreme circadian rhythms and aggressive predation. A highly toxic environment. Identified a hitherto unknown symbiosis with a new strain of parasitic fungus. Further observation necessary.”"
