"Head spinning, you stand up in an iridescent cavern. Smooth polished walls flicker with cool blue light, reflecting nightmarish images. Twisted stalagmites furl and unfurl into spirals, reaching up toward the ceiling like the stalks of some antediluvian flora. Screams fill the air: the cavern floor is covered in revelers clutching their limbs or heads. Cracks of shining light form on their skin and grow in intensity. Everything in the shining chamber is distorted by a gelid phosphorescence. You feel as though you are breathing heavy smoke in the thick warm air.\n"
"Ephemeral forms whorl around an empyrean brilliance at the center of the chamber. Silhouetted in front of the core of pure white light is Mother Rachel, her hair unbound and floating as if in deep water. Your head pounds as you stare into the brilliance, and you look down at the cavern floor. The injured revelers have stopped moving, and have gone gray and powdery. A few are clear as glass, refracting the clear light of the abyss into prismatic arrays. Others stand, petrified, holding their arms out toward the brilliance, each face frozen in a ghoulish smile.\n"
"The sound of Mother Rachel’s laughter echoes through the chamber as the matron stares into the abyss, holding her arms up overhead. Smoke gathers around her as her body dissolves into gas. Unsure of what is happening, you run up a hill of petrified human forms toward Mother Rachel and the abyss. Bones and dessicated corpses crack underfoot as you clamber to the top. Mother Rachel looks at you, exultant, before her body sublimates into pale fire.\n"
"An all-too-familiar euphoria floods your senses as the alien light pulses and bends the chamber around it. You feel an invisible hand on your shoulder; you brush it away. Something feels different. You hold up one hand to see a small, spidery crack of light form on your palm. The fissure lengthens to creep up your wrist, then your arm. The accompanying pain sends you into a dead faint.\n"

"你頭暈目眩的起身，發現自己身處一個虹彩燦爛的洞穴裡。光滑的牆壁閃爍著藍色冷光，反射出夢魘般的影像。扭曲的鐘乳石形成螺旋狀，向著天花板伸展，猶如某種上古植物的莖。尖叫聲充斥在空氣中：洞穴地板上滿是抓撓著四肢或頭部的狂歡者，他們的皮膚上出現閃亮的裂縫，光芒並越來越強烈。整個燦爛的洞室被一種冰冷的磷光扭曲，你感覺就像在濃厚的暖空氣中呼吸著濃煙。\n"
"在洞穴中心，轉瞬即逝的形體環繞著一個火焰狀的光輝。在純白色光芒的核心前，映照出瑞秋主母的輪廓，她的頭髮披散開來，仿佛在深水中飄動。當凝視著這光輝時，你的頭劇烈陣痛，於是垂頭看向洞穴地板。受傷的狂歡者停止了活動，皮膚變得灰色而粉末狀，有些人甚至像玻璃一樣透明，將深空的明亮光線折射成一個個虹色的陣列。其他人則僵硬地站著，將手臂伸向光輝，每一張臉都被凝固在一幅悚異的笑容中。\n"
"瑞秋主母的笑聲在洞穴中迴盪，她凝視著深空，雙臂高舉過頭。煙霧圍繞著她，將她的身體溶解成氣體。你對現在發生的事感到疑惑，沿著一個由石化的人形構成的山丘向瑞秋主母和深空跑去。無數骸骨和乾枯的屍體在腳下碎裂，你終於攀爬到山頂。瑞秋主母看著你，滿臉狂喜，然後她的身體昇華成蒼白的火焰。\n"
"一股過於熟悉的喜樂湧上你的感官，異異樣的光芒跳躍並扭曲著四周的洞穴。你感覺到一隻看不見的手放在你的肩膀上，你將它撥開，卻感覺手上有異樣，你舉起一隻手，看見手掌上出現一道小小的網狀裂縫，裂縫逐漸延伸，蔓延到腕部，然後是手臂。隨之而來的劇痛使你昏厥了過去。\n"
"你醒來，發現自己正站在一道寬闊的裂縫前，向下俯視。你看見自己不斷變扌 奐， 一隹又黑 貓、一亻立女 王、一件氵票 流 白 勺東 西、一隹又在 氵軍沌 與黑日 音 中爪巴 行白 勺生牛 物。 你是言隹 ？你為亻十 麼在辶言 裡？"

"“I understand what it is,” Dr. Marquez says. “It’s a living being. Some primal species, or something not of this world. It was brought here— perhaps by Captain Hemlock—and burrowed deep underground, where it permeated water, soil, crops. Everything. It is inherently poisonous to everything around it. Sort of a living miasma. A barely sentient numbing sickness. It emerged from Pearl Ridge 20 years ago, but it wasn’t ready to...to leave.” The professor pulls out a phosphorescent shard. “I think it came from this. One of the original shards that brought it to the island. The being drains its host like a parasite and leaves a crystallized husk behind. Freezes it in time. And then the parasite hatches as a gas from the ‘shell,’ joining...It.”\n"

The survivors gather around you. “Please, if you can find it in your heart, forgive us,” one says. Another sheds their mask and tattered cloak.
