Where people won’t find them. Then, on the night of the Feast, we’ll meet behind the schoolhouse.” When you ask him why he won’t place the fireworks himself, he smirks. “I’ve gotta get more gunpowder from my secret underground lair.

The old man’s face lights up at the question, and he gives a grim account detailing how the crew of his ship—the Annabelle Lee— grew gravely ill following their visit to the shipwreck. As he tells the story, you are joined by Dr. Marquez, who listens intently. You can sense an old fear in the grizzled sailor’s tone, but don’t press it further."

msgid "Dr. Marquez emerges from upstairs with a stony look on her face. Bertie follows, nursing a bandaged arm. His face is ashen as he recounts his experience: “I was walking at the edge of the woods—I think at midday—when I felt the most delicious, erm.” He struggles to put it into words. “An absolute joy. And then I suppose I lost myself. When I came to, it was night and I was quite lost. And now that I’ve returned, I can’t help but reflect on that breathless feeling. ‘Emotion recollected in tranquility,’ eh?” The professor rolls her eyes but doesn’t comment."
msgstr "馬爾克斯博士從樓上出現，面色陰沉，柏蒂跟在她身後，小心地護著裹著繃帶的手。回想起昨晚的經歷，他的臉色依然蒼白：“我在森林邊緣散步，應該是正午的時候，突然我感覺一切都絕頂美味，呃。”他努力找到適當的話來表達，“一種無上的喜悅，然後我想我就迷失自己了。我回過神來時已經是晚上，而且我迷路了。現在我回來了，但還是忍不住會想起那種窒息般的感覺，就像詩人們說的‘情緒總在寧靜後湧現’不是嗎？”教授翻了翻白眼，但沒有多做評論。"

msgid "Dr. Marquez slams the screen door as she enters. “Mother Rachel told me she found Bertie wandering around this morning. I saw him recovering at the Atwood House, and he looks just fine. Babbling nonsense and reading some of the local poetry.”"
msgstr "馬爾克斯博士甩上紗門，進入旅店。“瑞秋主母告訴我，她今早找到柏蒂了，他四處在遊蕩。他在阿特伍德大宅休養，我去看過他了，看起來沒事。只是一直胡言亂語，還不斷讀著當地的詩集。”"

msgid "Dr. Marquez pours herself a strong cup of coffee. “I’m going to take advantage of the cooling rain and head up to Pearl Ridge. Join me if you like,” she takes a bite of her eggs and wrinkles her nose. “Is that a metal taste?” She discretely spits the eggs into a handkerchief as Ms. Olmstead emerges from the kitchen with a stack of flapjacks and serves several hungry guests."
msgstr "馬爾克斯博士幫自己倒了一大杯咖啡。“我要趁著這陣清涼的雨去珍珠山脈調查，想要的話你可以一起來。”她咬了一口雞蛋，然後皺起眉頭，“這是金屬的味道嗎？”她小心地把口中的蛋吐到手帕上。奧姆斯德太太從廚房裡出現，拿著一堆燕麥餅，為幾個飢餓的客人上菜。"
