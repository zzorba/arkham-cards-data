msgstr "序章：終夜"

msgid "A flowering procession filled with riotous, gaudy colors files through the village toward the Crossroads. There must be several hundred people here tonight, if not more. You keep pace with Dr. Marquez toward the ghoulish effigy, spinning with reflected lights. Mother Rachel stands at the center of the crowd, holding her arms out like branches before the mirrored tree."
msgstr "擁擠的人群熙熙攘攘地朝著十字路口前進，至少有幾百個人，每個人身上都充滿明豔的色彩。你跟著馬爾克斯博士，朝著那棵令人毛骨悚然的肖像樹前進，被一路上反射而來的光線弄得頭暈目眩。瑞秋主母站在人群的正中央，面向掛滿鏡子的肖像樹，如同樹枝伸展般伸出雙手。"

msgid "The professor strides forward, holding Rebecca’s hand. All festivities cease as Mother Rachel turns around. “Everyone listen! Last night, Mother Rachel condemned a house full of sick people to death. I was there. They were not in their right mind.” Dr. Marquez entreats the revelers. “But that’s not all. There’s something living underneath this island. It’s sucking the life out of everything around it, and could devastate this entire village. We need to leave the island at once!” Mother Rachel looks at you, wounded. “What do you accuse me of? I gave my daughter as a sacrifice, and she was given back to me.”"
msgstr "教授握著蕾貝卡的手，大步走上前。瑞秋主母轉過身來，慶祝活動戛然而止。“所有人聽我說！昨晚，瑞秋主母將一整屋的病人宣判死刑，我當時就在場，他們全都神智不清。”馬爾克斯博士向這些狂歡者發出懇求，“不只是這樣，這座島底下生活著某種東西，它正在吸取這座島上的一切生命，整個村莊都有可能被毀滅，我們必須立刻離開這裡！”瑞秋主母用受傷的目光看著你：“你們到底在控訴我什麼？我獻出自己的女兒作為犧牲，現在她被歸還給我了。”"

msgstr "你走上前，跪倒在瑞秋主母的腳邊，馬爾克斯博士看到這幕，倒抽了一大口氣。主母用溫暖的目光看著你說：“你將受到無盡的歡迎，盛宴將有你的一席之地。你可以坐在我的右手邊，一同見證我們等待已久的奇蹟。”她牢牢的緊抓你的雙手，領著你加入盛宴，你順從的跟隨。"

msgstr "你給了馬爾克斯博士一個眼色，接著走上前，在瑞秋主母面前彎下身鞠躬。主母用溫暖的目光看著你說：“你將受到無盡的歡迎，桌邊將有你的一席之地。你可以坐在我的右手邊，一同見證我們等待已久的奇蹟。”她牢牢的緊抓你的雙手，領著你加入盛宴，你謹慎的跟隨。"

"The professor strides forward and shouts above the revelry. “The food here is poison! You’re all in grave danger: whatever this is, it’s changing everything around it. See?” Dr. Marquez tears mask after mask off each reveler, exposing frenzied, grinning faces. The surrounding crowd goes silent. Then, a clapping sounds, along with the sound of laughter. Mother Rachel raises her arms to silence them. “Cast out these slanderers! But let it not keep us from our celebration. The heavens beckon us! Let us feast!”\n"
"The last thing you see as you are pushed away from the clamor is the matron’s triumphant smile."
msgstr ""
"教授走向陷入狂喜狀態的群眾，大聲喊到：“這裡的食物有毒！你們正處在極度的危險中：不管那是什麼東西，它正在改變周遭的所有事物，看到了嗎？”馬爾克斯博士拉下每個狂歡者的面具，露出背後顛狂、猙獰的笑容，周圍的群眾一瞬間陷入寂靜。接著，一陣拍手聲伴隨大笑聲響起，瑞秋主母舉起手要求靜默，然後宣布：“驅逐這些造謠者！別讓任何事阻止我們的慶典，天堂在召喚我們！讓我們大快朵頤！”\n"
"你在叫囂聲中被推離，你最後看見的是主母臉上洋溢的勝利笑容。"

Welling up from the ground underneath...” Bertie’s eyes roll back in his head, a broad smile on his face."
msgstr "“你為什麼不相信瑞秋主母呢？”柏蒂氣喘吁吁地說著。舞蹈和狂歡持續進行，無人能夠阻止。每個人似乎都迷失在各自的思緒中，對這位年輕人的痛苦毫無知覺。當你緊緊抱著他時，你感到一陣遺憾。柏蒂將手伸向著那顆閃爍著眾多燈光的肖像樹：“我能看到它即將到來。你能感覺到嗎？從地下湧出……”柏蒂的眼睛上翻，臉上露出齜牙咧嘴的笑容。"

The professor holds a cloth to her mouth to hold back a sneeze. “Don’t breathe in whatever it is,” she signals."
msgstr "“大家都瘋了嗎？”馬爾克斯博士望著那些不停旋轉，或對著空氣說話的舞者。一團發光的孢子從周圍的森林和樹木中升起，教授用布巾捂住口鼻，抑制住一陣噴嚏。“不要吸進任何東西，誰知道那是什麼。”她警示到。"
