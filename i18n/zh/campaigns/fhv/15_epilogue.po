"To the office of Dr. Henry Armitage,\n"
"The survey of Hemlock Isle has concluded without Dr. Marquez. What we found there on that desolate island defies reason. An alien presence dominated the local ecosystem, warping the physical and mental wellbeing of every living thing in its proximity. We witnessed species that have never been documented before, and likely never will be again. The locals coexisted with this presence for decades, seemingly or intentionally unaware of its degenerative effects. Some even worshiped it. We count ourselves lucky to have survived.\n"
"Dr. Marquez, unfortunately, was not so lucky. Enclosed with this letter is a comprehensive account detailing her observations of this unique ecosystem. What it does not contain is the story of how—and how bravely—she gave her life. That is a story we wish to share with you in person. We ask, out of respect for her memory, that you not dismiss these records as mere fantasy. Faithfully yours,\n"

"赫姆拉克島的調查已經完成，但馬爾克斯博士卻未能回來。在那個荒涼的島嶼上，我們發現了令人難以置信的事物。一個外星存在支配著當地生態系統，扭曲每一個與之接觸的生物的身心健康。我們目睹了從未被記錄過的物種，很可能永遠不會再次被目擊。當地居民與這個存在共存了數十年，似乎或有意地忽視了它造成的突變性退化，有些人甚至崇拜它。我們很幸運才能倖存下來。\n"
"不幸的是，馬爾克斯博士沒有分享到這份幸運。這封信附上了她對這個獨特生態系統的詳細觀察報告。但其中並未記錄她是如何，以及多麼勇敢地獻出自己的生命，這是我們希望親自向您分享的故事。為了尊重博士的犧牲，我們請求您，希望您不要將這些記錄視為純粹的幻想。\n"

"The survey of Hemlock Isle has concluded at great cost. Over the course of our three day excursion, we witnessed horrors and wonders that defy all reason. A parasitic life form unlike any other fed on the local ecosystem, warping the biology of every living thing around it. I have enclosed a comprehensive account of the phenomena we witnessed, along with samples, notes, and sketches.\n"
"Although I was initially wary of your contacts, they provided invaluable support throughout the survey. Ultimately, the strange gaseous entity we discovered took their lives. Without their sacrifice, I would have perished, along with most of Hemlock Isle.\n"
"I will explain everything in further detail upon my return.\n"

"赫姆拉克島的調查已完成，卻付出極大代價。在三天的考察過程中，我們目睹了一切理性都無法解釋的恐怖和奇觀。一種前所未見的寄生生物以當地的生態系統為養分，扭曲著周圍每一個生物的生物特徵。我在此附上了我們目睹的現象的詳細報告，以及樣本、筆記和素描。\n"
"雖然一開始我對您的聯絡人們抱持懷疑態度，但在整個調查過程中，他們提供了寶貴的支援。最終，我們發現的奇異氣體實體奪走了他們的生命。如果沒有他們的犧牲，我和大半個赫姆拉克島上的生物都將失去生命。\n"
"一切細節待我返歸後詳細向您解釋。\n"

My friends in New York are already whispering about my fall from grace,” River says bitterly. William regards his cousin. “I think it’s time I returned to society. I’m sure I can set your friends right.” River pauses, then smirks as an idea comes to them. “Oh, William. My friends will love you. All you need to do is share one of your poems.

"Judith’s hunting jacket is splattered with blood and her hair is a mess as she approaches you, rifle slung over her shoulder. She looks down at her jacket when she sees your concern. “Oh, don’t worry. You should see the other guy,” she winks. You ask if she’s still going to Boston, and she shrugs. “Maybe, maybe not. I was gonna ask where you’re headed next.”\n"
"You tell her you’re headed to Arkham, and she suppresses a snort of disbelief. “Arkham, huh? The city that’s in the news with weird shit every other week? You’re really headed back there?” She goes quiet for a moment as if considering something. “You’re going to need someone to watch your back,” she ventures. You tell her you plan to take a long rest, and she smirks. “I’ve got a buddy who runs a speakeasy somewhere in Easttown. After everything we’ve been through, I’d say I owe you a drink.”"

"茱蒂絲的狩獵夾克上沾滿了鮮血，頭髮凌亂，肩膀上掛著步槍。當她走近，看到你關切的神情時，她低頭看了看自己的夾克，冷冷一笑說：“哦，別擔心。你應該看看另一個傢伙的慘狀。”她眨著眼向你使個眼色。你問她是否仍打算前往波士頓，她聳聳肩：“也許，也許不。我本來是要問問你接下來打算去哪。”\n"
"你告訴她你打算前往阿卡姆，她忍不住輕笑：“阿卡姆啊？那個每兩週就有怪事登上新聞的城市？你真的要回去？”她靜靜沉思片刻，似乎在考慮著什麼。“你需要有人幫你守著背後。”她陡然說到。你告訴她你打算好好休息一段時間，她得意地笑了笑：“我有個朋友在東城區經營一家地下酒吧。經歷了這一切，我想我欠你一杯。”"

When you ask him why, he looks down. “I really don’t know why.” He pauses to think, then goes on. “I always wanted a place that...that felt like home again. After mom and pop passed, Helen got—she got tough. And then I started to help out around the Vale, and they didn’t care how tough I was. It felt like home. And now that’s gone too.” He blinks tears from his eyes. “I guess home is what you make it. You should come visit us in Portland some time. I know you’ll love it,” he smiles."
msgstr "西奧臉上露出一個害羞的笑容，當你走近他，他用力地擁抱了你一下。當他放開你時，你看到他哭了。當你問他為什麼時，他低頭看著地面：“我真的不知道原因。”他停下來思考，然後繼續說到：“我一直希望有個感覺像家的地方。在爸媽過世後，海倫變得更……強了。然後我開始在谷地幫忙，這裡的人不在乎我堅不堅強，感覺就像在家一樣，而現在這一切也消失了。”他眨掉眼眶中的淚水，“但我想家是要自己去創造的。你該來波特蘭拜訪我們，我知道你會喜歡的。”他微笑著說。"
