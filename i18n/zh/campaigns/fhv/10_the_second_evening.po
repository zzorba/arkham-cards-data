msgid "Prelude: The Second Evening"
msgstr "序章：次夜"

msgid "The rain continues through the day. When you arrive at the Commons for dinner, the tables have been pushed to the sides of the room and warm lamps are hung from colorful ribbons. Dozens of new faces peer out from the crowd of cloaked locals: visitors from the mainland. A large sculpture looms in the center of the room, festooned with violet and white blossoms that seem to palpitate in the soft light. The room goes silent as Mother Rachel addresses the assembly. “Friends. Brethren. Each of you is a miracle of time and light. You are the promise of your true self—” The matron stops mid-sentence."
msgstr "雨下了一整天，你們抵達城鎮大堂用晚餐時，看見所有桌子都被推到一旁，溫暖的燈籠懸掛在鮮豔的彩帶上。除了穿著罩袍的當地人，還有數十張新面孔穿梭其間，是來自大陸的客人。一座雕塑佇立在大堂中央，用紫羅蘭跟白色的花朵點綴著，在柔和的光線下令人心中悸動。瑞秋主母向所有人問候時，大堂中安靜了下來：“朋友們，兄弟姐妹們，你們每個人都是時間與光明的奇蹟，你們都為真實的自我許下了承諾 — ”修女長停頓了一下。"

msgid "<i>If Simeon survived</i> is recorded in Simeon Atwood’s Notes:"
msgstr "如果西緬．阿特伍德的筆記中有記錄<i>西緬活下來了</i>："

msgid "A shadow passes over the matron’s face as she sways, looking for a moment as though she might faint. The air in the room swirls thickly. Oily patterns dance in the light as you feel a now-familiar light-headedness. Someone steps forward to help Mother Rachel, but she holds up one hand and steadies herself."
msgstr "她的臉上閃過一道陰影，身形不穩的搖晃著，像是下一刻就會暈厥一樣。大堂中的空氣突然變得凝重，光線中似乎有什麼圖案在舞動，像是水面上的油漬，你感覺到一股熟悉的目眩感。有些人上前想扶住瑞秋主母，但她用一隻手及時穩住了自己。"

msgid "A sturdy figure cuts through the crowd. “Has anyone seen Simeon?” Leah Atwood asks in a trembling voice. She looks at the assembly with wide, searching eyes. “Please. Simeon. Now’s not the time for pranks,” she addresses her son, but to no response. The air in the room swirls thickly. “Enough,” Mother Rachel shoos her sister away. Oily patterns dance in the light as you feel a now-familiar light-headedness."
msgstr "一個身材結實的身影穿過群眾，一邊大喊著：“有人看到西緬嗎？”莉亞．阿特伍德顫抖地發問，她睜大眼睛看向人群，搜尋著兒子的身影，“拜託，西緬，現在不是惡作劇的時候。”她呼喚著兒子的名字，但沒有任何回應。大堂中的氣氛突然凝重起來。“夠了。”瑞秋主母出聲阻止她的妹妹。，光線中似乎有什麼圖案在舞動，像是水面上的油漬，你感覺到一股熟悉的目眩感。"

msgid "Mother Rachel regains her composure. “Tonight is the shortest night of the year. And tomorrow is the beginning of eternity. So on this night, let us dance.” The assembly bursts into rapturous applause. A ragtag band in the corner starts playing as the dance begins. Several friendly faces beckon you to join."
msgstr "瑞秋主母重拾鎮定，開口宣布：“今晚是一年中最短的一夜，而明天我們將迎接永恆的開端，所以今晚讓我們盡情舞蹈吧！”群眾爆發出欣喜萬分的掌聲，角落中的樂隊用五花八門的樂器開始奏樂，有幾張友善的臉孔邀請你加入舞會。"

msgid "You may choose whom you would like to dance with. One at a time, each investigator may choose a different codex entry from the following (if there is only one investigator, you may choose two to resolve instead). If a resident’s name is crossed out, you cannot choose their codex."
msgstr "你可以選擇要與誰共舞。一次一位，每位調查員可以從以下的聖典條目中選擇一個條目，不可重複。(如果遊戲中只有一位調查員，你可以改為結算兩個條目)。如果該住民的名字已經被劃掉，你不能選擇對應的條目。"

msgid "The Vale’s matriarch stands apart from the throng, arms crossed. Tears glisten on her cheeks as she watches the room. You approach and ask her to dance. “I’m sorry. I can’t,” she replies. The strain in her voice is evident, and you ask what the matter is. “We are called to give up many things in this life. I only pray that what we gain is worth the cost.”"
msgstr "谷地的領導人站在離人群有段距離的地方，雙手抱胸。她的目光投向大堂中的人們，臉上的淚痕晶亮可見。你上前邀請她共舞，“抱歉，我不行。”她回應，聲音中的緊繃清晰可聞，你詢問是否有什麼問題。“我們被要求放棄此生的許多東西，我只希望最後的回報能值得這些付出。”"

msgstr "你發現莉亞站在餐桌旁，雙手顫抖。“西緬最近一直提到什麼‘礦工俱樂部’，我在想他會不會 — ”她的臉色瞬間蒼白，“抱歉，我現在不能跳舞。”"

msgid "Leah steps out onto the wooden floor with you and dances along. Although she can’t quite keep step with the music, she sweeps you off your feet with surprising ease and spins you around. The others cheer as you take a bow."
msgstr "莉亞跟著你踏上木製地板，與你一同起舞。雖然她跟不太上拍子，但她踏著從容的舞步，與你一同旋轉，讓你十分驚艷。當你們鞠躬致意時，眾人拍手歡呼。"

msgstr "“來首德克薩斯湯米吧！”西緬舉高雙手打著節拍，樂團跟上他的節奏。“不錯，不錯。”你感覺到有某種冰冷黏滑的東西爬上你的腿，當你把一條纏在腳踝上的襪帶蛇趕走時，他發出得逞的奸笑。"

msgstr "“我已經好幾年沒跳過舞，疏於練習了，但有何不可呢？”威廉跟你一起走進舞池，跳起了華爾滋。你們絆倒了幾次、出醜了幾次，終於提早將這支舞跳完了。這位年長的赫姆拉克家族後裔帶著愉快的心情走回了角落。"

msgstr "“單腳前蹲，然後踏步回來！”芮福指導周圍所有人跳起了黑人搖擺舞。其他人努力地跟上節奏，你則盯著芮福，跟著他的動作。舞蹈結束後，芮福拍了拍你的肩膀說：“不錯，親愛的，跳得不錯。”"

msgstr "“好啊，但我只跳《洋基歌》。”吉迪恩露出一個開朗的笑容，彷彿年輕了幾歲。你走到樂團那點歌，走回舞池時，你看見老水手已經隨著音樂開始搖擺了。“我的姪女葛莉菈很愛這首歌，我有好幾年沒見過她了……。”"

msgid "Midway into the evening, the dance reaches a lull. While rain patters outside, the dancing revelers move like smoke in the dim commons. Dr. Marquez signals you to join her at the side of the room. “There’s something very wrong here,” she says in a low voice. “There are maybe a dozen members of the Vale who have disappeared—some even in the last few days. Mother Rachel seems blissfully unconcerned. And then there are these ‘wonders’ everyone talks about. I’m starting to suspect the ‘wondrous’ feeling here isn’t just hypoxia.” You mention your own dizziness and strange euphoria over the past few days."

In the last year of her life, Madame Pearl was wracked by hallucinations and a chronic wasting disease.

Reading between the lines, I get the impression the entire Pearl family was similarly affected prior to the incident that devastated the ridge.”"

Dr. Marquez nods along. “Everything is affected. Sickly. Starving. Mutating. And it’s all highly localized. There are no reports of these strange phenomena elsewhere. It’s only here.” She produces a creased map of the island and points to the north hills. “Pearl Ridge hasn’t recovered in the past twenty years since it was obliterated.”\n"
"Marquez holds up two rings of glassy wood from both Eastwick Bog and Pearl Orchard, then draws a ring around Pearl Ridge on her map. “The bitter eggs this morning reminded me of a report after the Tunguska event. A meteorite obliterated miles of Russian countryside, but the effects on the locals were even more devastating. Stores of food were poisoned. Livestock perished. Nearby villages were slowly deserted as families who lived there for generations died of starvation or worse.” She draws a larger concentric circle around the first.\n"
"“Nobody has said anything about a meteor, but judging by the massive sinkhole in front of the Pearl Estate, something emerged from the rock. My working theory is that the mining operation opened a vein and released whatever poisoned gas or mineral affecting the island.”\n"
