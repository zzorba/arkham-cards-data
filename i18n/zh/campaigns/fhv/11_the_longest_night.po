"As you approach Atwood Farm, the clouds recede to reveal a blood-red sunset that casts the landscape in hazy shadows. You follow Dr. Marquez past a neglected coop and barn to the back porch of the derelict farmhouse. As the professor jams a crowbar under a boarded window, you notice the revolver in her back pocket. “Just some insurance,” she says.\n"
"It takes some time to pry the boards off the windows. As you climb in after the professor, your senses sting with the scent of rot and sick. Once your eyes adjust to the murk, you see a harrowing scene. Dirty cots line the walls, and the floor is streaked with refuse. A dozen sickly people lay on cots and sit, slumped against the walls. Their skin is knotted and hard, riddled with sharp spurs and sinewy growths. Several of them have limp flaps of loose flesh that you soon realize are vestigial limbs. Others look up at you with glassy eyes, while others with gray, powdery skin lay, inert, staring up at the ceiling.\n"
"“You shouldn’t be here,” says a voice. A balding man in a tattered Vale cloak steps toward you with a halting gait. Dr. Marquez squints in the dim. “Tad? From the general store?” Before he can answer, you hear voices from the front porch. You and Dr. Marquez dash behind a pile of broken furniture just as the front door clicks and swings open. Mother Rachel enters alongside a half dozen cloaked figures and several more sickly locals.\n"
"The matron addresses the room, beaming. “My Star Children. Your time has come at last. You will prepare the way.” She leans down and holds a wheelchair-bound woman’s hand. “All of you have been made whole. And now you will join your other selves in eternity.”"

"你們前往阿特伍德農場，雲朵退去，露出血紅色的落日，大地被籠罩在一片朦朧的暗影中。你跟著馬爾克斯博士走過廢棄的雞舍跟穀倉，來到荒廢農舍後方的門廊上。教授拿出一跟撬棍插進封死窗戶的木板間，就在這時你看見她後面的口袋中插著一把左輪手槍，她說：“只是以防萬一。”\n"
"你們花了一點時間才撬開木板，你跟在教授身後爬進窗戶，立刻聞到一股刺鼻的腐敗與患病氣味。當你的眼睛適應了晦暗的光線，眼前的景象讓你驚恐不已。骯髒的板床在牆邊排成一列，地上堆滿各種垃圾與廢棄物，十幾名帶著病容的人或躺在板床上，或頹然的坐倒在牆邊，他們的皮膚僵硬而糾結，長滿尖銳的尖刺跟突起的瘤塊。有幾個人還長著幾塊鬆垮的贅肉，你細看後才發現那是退化的四肢。有些人用呆滯的目光看著你們，另一些有著發灰、粉末化皮膚的人則眼神空洞地盯著天花板。\n"
"“你們不該在這裡的。”一道聲音說，一個穿著破爛谷地罩袍的光頭男子猶豫地走上前，對你們說到。馬爾克斯博士瞇起眼睛，在微光中試圖辨認來人：“泰德？開雜貨店的？”在他回答前，你們聽見前門廊傳來聲音，迅速躲到一堆破爛的家具後，門隨即發出解鎖的聲響並打開，瑞秋主母帶著六名身穿罩袍的身影走進來，還帶著更多患病的當地人。\n"
"修女長問候房間中的人，大聲宣告：“我的眾星之子，你們的時刻終於到來了。你們將準備踏上道路。”她俯下身握住一名坐著輪椅的女人的手，“你們都已完整，現在是時候加入永恆中的另一個自我了。”"

"Mother Rachel smiles benevolently. “My children. There are some things we are not meant to see until it is our time to see them. But then, I suppose, it is your place to witness our ascension.” She holds her arms out in an exultant pose. “Each of us accepts our place in creation. We have been remade beyond the concerns of conventional medicine. I understand it may seem foolish, even cruel, to an outsider, but each of us is here of our own volition. Even you.” The room nods along in agreement.\n"
"“You’re being deceived! Can’t you see?” Dr. Marquez says, furious. “These people are dying!” You search the room, hoping for some support."

"瑞秋主母慈祥地笑著說：“我的孩子們，有些事我們在被允許見證前，都不應該看見。不過我想，也許你們的天命就是見證我們的昇華。”她歡欣鼓舞地伸出雙臂，“我們每個人都要接受自己被創造出來的天命，我們已經重塑自我，超越了傳統醫學的範疇。我了解在外人的眼中，這很愚蠢，甚至殘忍，然而我們每個人都是出於自身的意志來到這裡的，即使是你們也一樣。”房間中的人們點著頭，出聲同意。\n"
"“你們被蒙蔽了！妳還看不出來嗎？”馬爾克斯博士狂怒的大吼，“這些人正在死去！”你們掃視房間，希望有人能支持你們。"

"Mother Rachel’s eyes are glassy with tears as she addresses the room. “Your sacrifice is not in vain. Tonight, you each will fulfill your place in creation and join us tomorrow for the great ascension.” The matron wears a careworn smile as she addresses you. “This is not your sacrifice to make. Please, return to the Vale.” Dr. Marquez glowers in response. Mother Rachel’s eyes well with tears as she leaves with her procession.\n"
"“What did she mean by ‘ fulfill your place in creation’?” Dr. Marquez asks Tad as he rubs scaly growths from his forearms. The balding man smiles. “Tomorrow, the blood moon heralds our ascension. But tonight, on the shortest night of the year, all the creatures of the forest and fields will help us complete our journey.”\n"
"“I’m sorry, but that doesn’t answer my question,” the professor replies.\n"
"Tad grins. “We will all be devoured. It is our place to make this sacrifice.” As he looks to the horizon, a chorus of mournful howls echoes across the fields.\n"
"The professor looks at Tad, horrified. “Like hell you will,” she says. You follow her outside. Dark shapes stand outlined on distant hills. The professor is briefly lost in thought, then takes a sharp breath. “I doubt any of them are in their right mind. But maybe if we hold out long enough, we can get them proper care and attention.” You look past the farmhouse to the rolling fields. You don’t have time to evacuate the captives before sunset. Moreover, you don’t have any guarantee they’ll follow you. But you have to try.\n"
"Together, you and the professor scavenge the collapsing farm for spare parts. You find scraps of wood, barbed wire, and old trapping equipment to fortify your position. If you can outlast the night, some of the captives might be saved. A hideous baying breaks the still air as the sun sets.\n"

"“她說的‘實現自己在偉大造物中的天命’是什麼意思？”馬爾克斯博士轉頭對泰德發問，他正揉著自己前臂上的一個嚇人的腫胞，這個光頭男子笑著說：“明晚，血月會見證我們的昇華。但今晚，一年中最短的夜晚，所有森林裡跟原野上的生物會幫助我們完成旅程。”\n"
"“抱歉，但你沒有回答到我的問題。”教授說。\n"
"泰德咧嘴笑到：“我們都會被吞噬，我們的天命就是犧牲。”他看向地平線，哀號聲所組成的大合唱迴盪在整個原野上。\n"
"教授盯著泰德，看起來嚇壞了：“見鬼，你們不會真的這麼做。”你跟著她走到外面，遠方的山丘上立著無數黑暗的形影，教授一瞬間陷入沉思，然後猛吸了一口氣：“我懷疑他們的思緒都不太正常，但如果我們可以支撐足夠長的時間，也許可以讓他們得到適當的照顧跟關注。”你的目光掃過農舍跟前方開闊的田野，太陽完全下山前絕對來不及把這些病人撤離。話說回來，你也不確定他們會不會願意跟你們走，但你必須全力一試。\n"
"你跟教授一起設法在荒廢的農場裡找到了一些可用的材料，一些木板、帶刺的鐵絲，還有老舊的陷阱工具，可以利用它們來鞏固你們的防禦。如果你們能撐過這個夜晚，也許有些病人能獲救。日落了，一聲充滿恨意的嚎叫打破了靜寂的空氣。\n"

"The last thing you remember before the nightmarish shapes overwhelm you is a feeling of intense calm. The silver moonlight bathes the farm in stark monochrome as the creatures rip into your flesh. For a moment, you see your place in this world, as Mother Rachel intended. You are merely energy being converted to another form of energy.\n"
"Nothing else seems so perfect."
msgstr ""
"無盡的平靜，這是你在被夢魘般的形體淹沒前，感受到的最後一絲情緒。詭異的生物撕扯你的血肉時，銀色的月光將農場染上一層詭異的單色調。這瞬間，你看見了自己在這個世界上的歸處，就像瑞秋主母說的一樣。你只不過是從一種能量，轉變成另一種形式的能量。\n"
"無與倫比的完美。"

msgid "“Please, listen,” Dr. Marquez implores the captives. “Each of you deserves to live a full life. We can help! You can receive care on the mainland.” Tad spits in response. “You’ve robbed us of a great privilege. We were chosen.” Dr. Marquez hardly answers before a jagged plank of wood swings out from behind her, striking her on the shoulder. One of the captives holds it overhead, while several others gather round. Tad looks balefully at the professor and growls, “Leave now.” Dr. Marquez rises gingerly and walks out of the farmhouse. You follow her. “Idiots. We saved their lives,” she scoffs. As you leave, a young girl wearing a rabbit mask peers out from under some debris. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr "“拜託，聽著。”馬爾克斯博士懇求這些俘虜，“你們所有人都值得好好生活，我們可以幫忙！你們在大陸上可以獲得更多醫療幫助。”泰德吐了一口口水做回應：“你們奪走了我們偉大的權力，我們是被選中的人！”馬爾克斯博士還來不及回答，一根粗糙的木板從後面砸中她的肩膀，一名病患將木板舉高過頭，其他幾個病患也開始聚集。泰德用惡毒的眼神盯著她，低吼到：“現在就離開。”馬爾克斯博士戰戰兢兢地起身，走出農舍，你跟在她身後。“一群笨蛋，我們救了他們的命。”她怒斥著。你們離開時，一個戴著兔子面具的小女孩從瓦礫堆底下偷看你們，你認出她是蕾貝卡，瑞秋主母的女兒。"

msgid "Tad stands in the center of the farmhouse, his white- gold Vale cloak stained crimson. Surrounding him, the half-eaten corpses of the slain captives are arranged in a kind of circle. When you approach, the middle-aged man laughs bitterly. “Why was I spared, and so many others taken?” He raises both hands to his face and laughs hysterically. “Why is everything so bright?!” he giggles, clawing at his own eyes. You turn away and join Dr. Marquez outside, hunched over a pile of wreckage. A young girl wearing a rabbit mask scrambles out from underneath the debris. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr "泰德站在農舍正中央，谷地襯金白袍被染上鮮紅的顏色。在他周圍，被啃食一半的俘虜屍體排成了一個奇怪的圓。你們靠近時，這位中年男子露出苦笑：“為什麼只有我被留下了，而其他人都被帶走了？”他雙手摀面，歇斯底里地大笑，“為什麼所有東西都這麼亮？！”他狂笑著，緊抓著雙眼。你轉身離開，到外面與馬爾克斯博士會合，她彎身看著一片殘骸，一個戴著兔子面具的小女孩跌跌撞撞地從瓦礫堆底下走出來。你認出她是蕾貝卡，瑞秋主母的女兒。"

msgid "“We can’t stay!” Dr. Marquez shouts. Utterly overwhelmed, you dash out of the fray and into the cornfields. Nightmarish shadows charge past you, braying and howling. You think of the captives in the farmhouse, staring their deaths head-on. At the far edge of the field, you find Dr. Marquez holding a young girl wearing a rabbit mask. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr "“我們不能待在這！”馬爾克斯博士大喊。你被恐懼淹沒，脫離戰場衝進玉米田中，夢魘般的形體從你身旁跑過，發出嘶吼與嚎叫，你想起了農舍裡的俘虜，眼睜睜看著他們死去。在田野的另一端，你找到了馬爾克斯博士，她牽著一個戴著兔子面具的小女孩，你認出她是蕾貝卡，瑞秋主母的女兒。"

"The morning sun beats down, blindingly bright, as you cut through the fields back to the Vale. Flecks of slick, dark liquid drip from the withered stalks as you push through. Dr. Marquez stops and runs a hand under the brittle leaves. “The fields are painted with blood. But why?” She wipes the blood on a handkerchief and surveys the dripping field. “What kind of monster would do this? Sentencing her followers—her own daughter—to death. It’s almost biblical.”\n"
"Rebecca pulls back her mask and shakes her head. “Mother says it’s our way. And she doesn’t want me to die. She told me to hide. She said we were playing a game. ‘Make yourself very small and hide near the barrels of kerosene. The animals won’t smell you there’.”\n"
"“But why bring you here at all?” the professor asks.\n"
"“Some people didn’t want to come to the barn. But when mama told them I would be there too, they said it was okay.”\n"
"The group falls silent as you pass from one field and back into view of the Vale, veiled in gold under the radiant dawn. Suddenly, Dr. Marquez stops and takes you aside. “We may be able to use this as leverage. Rebecca is living proof of Mother Rachel’s hypocrisy, as horrible as that sounds. Everyone on Hemlock Isle will be at the Feast tonight. If we ask Rebecca to tell them what Mother Rachel said to her, we may be able to sway at least some of them to leave. And if that doesn’t work, we can high-tail it back to the mainland and get the law involved.”\n"
"The professor turns to Rebecca. “Can we play a game? Like last night? Your mother told me she wants you to hide until the Feast.” The young girl nods. Dr. Marquez lets out a manic giggle: strangely out of character for her usual controlled affect. You can’t help but suppress a grin, too, despite the horrors you just witnessed."

"你們穿過田野回到谷地，早晨的陽光灑落，刺眼的令人盲目。你們經過一片枯萎的花莖旁，黏稠的液體滴落在地上，形成黑色的斑點。馬爾克斯博士停下腳步，輕輕扶起一片脆弱的葉子，“這片田野被灑上了鮮血，為什麼？”她用手帕擦去血跡，在血跡斑斑的田野中調查。“什麼樣的怪物才能做出這種事，要她的追隨者 —甚至是自己的女兒去送死。這是什麼舊約故事。”\n"
"蕾貝卡抬起面具，搖著頭說：“媽媽說這是我們的天命，還有她不想要我死掉，她叫我躲起來，她說我們在玩遊戲，她叫我‘把自己卷縮起來，躲在煤油桶附近，動物就聞不到妳了。’”\n"
"“但她一開始為什麼要把妳帶到這裡？”教授問到。“有些人不想去穀倉那裡，但媽媽跟他們說我也會去，他們就說好了。”\n"
"所有人都陷入沉默，你們穿過田野，俯瞰著谷地，燦爛的陽光在村莊蒙上一層金色的面紗。馬爾克斯博士突然停下，示意你到一旁說話：“我們也許可以把這個當作籌碼，揭穿瑞秋主母虛偽的面具，蕾貝卡就是活生生的證據，如果事情真的像她說的一樣恐怖的話。今晚赫姆拉克島上的所有人都會來參加盛宴，如果我們能讓蕾貝卡說出瑞秋主母對她說的話，至少能說服一部份的人離開。如果不管用的話，我們就盡速離開，回到大陸上，讓法律介入。”\n"
"教授轉身對蕾貝卡說：“我們也來玩個遊戲好嗎？就像昨天晚上一樣？妳媽媽跟我說希望妳躲起來，直到盛宴開始。”小女孩點點頭，馬爾克斯博士發出一聲咯咯的笑聲，跟她平常嚴肅的形象完全不合。讓你也差點笑了出來，一瞬間忘了稍早目睹的恐怖景象。"
