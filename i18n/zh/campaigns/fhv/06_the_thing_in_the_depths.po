msgid "The road to Eastwick Bog branches sharply off from the same road you took in from Akwan. The landscape is incredibly vibrant, almost tropical, with rainbow-patterned tree trunks standing guard at the edge of black mirrored ponds. Dr. Marquez and Judith trade friendly barbs in the truckbed, occasionally swatting away gnats. As the conversation turns sour, you attempt to break the tension by asking Judith for a hunting story."
msgstr "你們走在前往艾灣的路上，一條分岔路急遽轉向，指引通往東方沼澤的方向。這裡的地貌茂盛的令人難以置信，幾乎像是熱帶雨林的景觀，樹幹上有虹彩般的圖樣，樹木如靜默的守衛般佇立在黑色鏡面般的平靜池塘旁。馬爾克斯博士跟茱蒂絲在後車斗互相挖苦，偶爾揮手趕走叮人的蚊蟲，一開始她們的談話還是以善意居多，但氣氛逐漸變得緊張。你詢問朱蒂絲有沒有什麼有趣的狩獵故事，試圖打破這個緊繃的狀態。"

"Judith doesn’t miss a beat. “See this scar? I got it in a fight at a speakeasy. Some rich kid cut me with a broken bottle. A friendly scuffle, y’know. His family was from this area, and very rich, I’ll add again, and they were so afraid a scandal’d break out that they offered me a job. Not that I woulda ratted on him.”\n"
"“I don’t know what I expected to hear from a bodyguard, but it wasn’t that,” says Dr. Marquez, possibly annoyed. An acrid breeze, smelling sweetly of death, blows off the bog and ends the conversation. The truck comes to a stop. Judith rolls her eyes, pulls on a pair of old waders, and walks out onto the bog, rifle slung over her shoulder.\n"
"“Believe me or don’t. I’m just here for the money.”"

"茱蒂絲毫不遲疑地說：“看到這個疤嗎？這是在一場酒吧鬥毆裡弄的，一個富家子弟用碎玻璃瓶割傷我，只是場友善的爭執，你懂得。他的家族就來自這一區，容我再強調一次，他們非常有錢，而且擔心這種醜聞會傳出去，所以他們給了我一個工作，換取我守口如瓶。”\n"
"馬爾克斯博士有點煩躁地說：“我不知道自己想從保鑣那聽到什麼樣的故事，但絕對不是這種。”一股刺鼻的微風拂過沼澤，打斷了談話，空氣中帶著一絲死物的甜膩味。卡車停了下來，茱蒂絲翻了個白眼，穿上一套老舊的防水連身衣，將來福槍扛在肩上，走進沼澤之中。\n"
"“信不信由你，我是看在錢的份上才來的。”她說。"

"The young woman’s steely demeanor relaxes. “Something big lives in Eastwick Bog. An apex predator the size of a killer whale, with razor sharp teeth and too many eyes. Smells like rotten seaweed.” You tell her it sounds like she has personal experience with the creature, and she nods. “I owe it. Or it owes me. See this?” She points to the wicked scar on her cheek. “That thing almost took my eye. I plan to settle the score.” Dr. Marquez is nonplussed. “I guess you think an academic will buy up any story, but if you expect me to believe—” An acrid breeze, smelling sweetly of death, blows off the bog and stops Judith mid-retort. The truck comes to a stop. Judith pulls a bandana over her nose and mouth, slides into a pair of old waders and walks out onto the bog, rifle slung over her shoulder.\n"

"這位年輕女性緊繃著的表情放鬆了下來，“東方沼澤裡有某種巨型生物，一隻跟殺人鯨差不多大小的頂級掠食者，牙齒跟剃刀一樣利，眼睛的數量多的不自然，全身散發腐爛海草的味道。”你提出這聽起來像是她的親身經歷，她點了點頭：“牠欠我一次，我跟牠有筆帳要算，看到這個了嗎？”她指著自己臉上的一道猙獰的疤痕說，“那玩意兒差點弄瞎我的眼睛，我打算以眼還眼。”馬爾克斯博士看起來有點不知所措：“我猜妳覺得一個學者會接受任何天方夜譚，但如果妳期望我會相信妳的話 — ”一股刺鼻的微風拂過沼澤，打斷了茱蒂絲的反駁，空氣中帶著一絲死物的甜膩味。卡車停了下來，茱蒂絲用頭巾摀住口鼻，穿上一套老舊的防水連身衣，將來福槍扛在肩上，走進沼澤之中。\n"

The landscape is incredibly vibrant, almost tropical, with rainbow-patterned tree trunks standing guard at the edge of black mirrored ponds. The truck suddenly hits a patch of deep mud and squelches to a halt. “I think I need some help,” Theo says."
msgstr "我真的不懂為什麼大家都喜歡看《地心冒險》，中空的地球？聽起來太瘋狂了。”西奧的閒聊聲伴隨著大雨打在車廂上的聲音。沼澤的地貌茂盛的令人難以置信，幾乎像是熱帶雨林的景觀，樹幹上有虹彩般的圖樣，樹木如靜默的守衛般佇立在黑色鏡面般的平靜池塘旁。卡車突然停下，陷入一漥爛泥中，輪子不斷發出空轉的聲音。西奧說：“我好像需要一點幫助。”"

Theo waves dismissively. “I can get those on the way back. I’ve got some family stuff back in Akwan to take care of.” Theo leaves you at the edge of the bog, wreathed in mist in the chill rain."
msgstr "經過一番掙扎，你們設法將車輪推出了坑洞，指引西奧通過滿是坑洞的崎嶇河岸。幾袋補給品從車斗掉出來，西奧不在意的揮揮手說：“我回程的時候再撿吧，我得去艾灣處理一些家務事。”西奧將你們放在沼澤邊緣，冰冷的雨霧籠罩你們。"

msgstr "每位調查員在下一場冒險開始時減少1次行動。"

msgid "Theo presses his shoulder to the rear of the truck as you rev the gas. The vehicle lurches forward only to bury the front tire in another pothole. Theo jumps into the truck next to you and lets out an exhasperated sigh. “I think you’ll have to continue on foot from here. It’s not that far.”"
msgstr "西奧在車後用肩膀頂著卡車，你則大力踩下油門，車子向前猛衝，前輪卻再度落入另一個坑洞中。西奧在你身邊跳上車，惱怒的喘著氣說：“我想你們可能得走過去，已經不遠了。”"

msgstr "每位調查員在下一場冒險開始時減少2資源。"

msgid "The road to Eastwick Bog is covered in rough potholes that reflect a brilliant, prismatic sheen in the sky above. Theo stops the truck as the road grows treacherous. “I’m sorry to do this, but this old girl can’t make the trip through all that mud,” Theo says. You step off the truckbed, say goodbye to Theo, and walk down the muddy road past a close thicket of gaudy, colored trees riven with cracks of light."
msgstr "通往東方沼澤的路上布滿積水的坑洞，映射著天空中明亮多彩的光芒。隨著道路越來越崎嶇，西奧停下了卡車說到：“抱歉，我也不想這樣，但這台老夥計沒辦法通過那些泥巴。”你們下了車，向他道別，然後步行穿越泥濘的道路，路邊的樹木被染上艷麗的色彩，光芒從樹幹上的裂縫傾洩而出。"

msgid "The moonlight is as bright as day, illuminating the desolate landscape around the truck like something in a Grimm fairy tale. An acrid breeze blows off the bog, smelling sweetly of death, as you pull to a stop on the shoreline and look up at the moon, veiled in gathering clouds. A single thin tree stands silhouetted against the moon, reaching up like a grasping hand. You hoist your supplies out of the truck and look back. The thin tree has disappeared, leaving a dark ripple in its wake."
msgstr "明亮的月光將夜晚變得如白天一般，照亮卡車旁荒涼的地貌，像是在童話故事中。一股刺鼻的微風拂過沼澤，空氣中帶著一絲死物的甜膩味，你們停在岸邊，抬頭望著月亮逐漸被雲給遮蓋。月光映照出一棵孤立瘦長的樹木，它的輪廓直入天際，像是朝天空伸出雙手一般。你們將補給品從卡車上卸下，但一轉頭那棵瘦高的樹木就消失了，只在黑暗中留下一片漣漪。"

Silhouetted against a sliver of light is a magnificent stag. Its long, looping antlers are covered in moss and fungal growths and it glows with a pale incandescence. Theo grins. “Isn’t it beautiful? I mean, I’m sure it’d kill us if it saw us. But, well,” he waves his hand. “I’m glad I found you. There was something moving down on the shore, but I didn’t bother checking.

The reptile moans as you lift the glowing gray blossom from its back, then opens its mouth to expose rows of serrated teeth as it snaps at you. Arsenic white fluid spurts from the hollow stem, coating you with a stinking secretion that burns your skin. You nearly drop the blossom as you stumble back, realizing your mistake. The vapors from the fluid make you dizzy and lend the forest an exaggerated fluorescence. The poor reptilian creature flails in pain and sinks, leaving swirls of milky blood on the surface. A sharp pain forces you to drop the alkaloid blossom, and you examine your hand to find a sharp cut on your palm. The shape of the wound suggests the stem had begun to penetrate the flesh. You put the sample in a specimen jar and head for the southern shore."
msgstr "你正在用剪刀採集這些植物的莖，但你感到有什麼事不對勁。在你將發出灰光的花朵從牠背上摘下時，這隻龜型生物發出哀號，牠張開帶著鋸齒狀尖牙的巨嘴朝你咬下。中空的花莖流出白色的砷化物液體，分泌物滴在你的皮膚上，造成刺痛跟灼燒感。你踉蹌後退，差點鬆手放開花朵，同時意識到自己犯了個錯。那些液體蒸散發出的氣體讓你感到頭暈目眩，周遭的森林也染上一層誇張的螢光。那隻可憐的爬蟲類在痛苦中揮動四肢，沉入水中，在水面上留下一團乳白色的血液。一股尖銳的刺痛襲來，迫使你放開這些狀似水仙的花朵，你查看自己的手，發現手掌上有一道尖銳的割痕，傷口的形狀顯示花莖剛才已經開始試圖穿透你的血肉。你將樣本放進採樣罐，轉身朝著南岸走去。"

"“If you shoot the thing I came here to survey, you will not be paid,” Dr. Marquez says coldly. The professor pulls out a notebook and begins sketching the creature. A hush falls over the group as a pair of frogs swim across the pond in front of the creature. In an instant, the chelydran hybrid opens its mouth to expose 4 separate rows of teeth lining the back of its throat, then snaps up both frogs.\n"

Its last roar is cut short as the Thing sinks below the fetid marsh."
