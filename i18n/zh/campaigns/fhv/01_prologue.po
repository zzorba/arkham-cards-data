"Miskatonic Survey, June 1926. Members Marquez, Musgrave, et alii.\n"
"After three separate reviews by Miskatonic University’s board and grant commitee, we have reached Hemlock Isle. Our driver took us across a natural land-bridge they call the “causeway”—only traversible at low tide—to a small fishing village called Akwan. Bertie showed the locals several sketches and photographs of the alkaline blossom, but the locals would have none of it. Or maybe none of him. Bertie is exceedingly chipper.\n"
"The survey consists of myself, my assistant Bertie Musgrave, and some contacts of Dr. Armitage. He insisted they accompany me as part of the terms of the grant. I just hope they don’t get in the way. The island is private property and has been off-limits to visitors for some time—until now. The locals are advertising some kind of festival throughout New England, even as far south as Boston and Arkham.\n"
"There were no lodgings in Akwan, and according to local rumors, camping on the island is a risky affair. The locals were unresponsive when I pressed further, but I was at least able to procure a map of the island as well as some basic supplies. We were all but resigned to pitching a tent west of Akwan, but then we met a young man named Theo who offered us lodging in a village called ‘Hemlock Vale’.\n"

"</blockquote>\n"
"“But really, I think you’re gonna love it here,” Theo shouts from the truck window. Dr. Marquez—athletic and well-tanned at 40—closes her survey journal and looks up at the sky. “I don’t know anyone who doesn’t love Hemlock Isle,” Theo continues. “And I don’t know why we haven’t invited folks sooner! I assume you’re here for the Feast.”\n"
"“Is this feast some sort of local tradition?” Bertie says in a crisp British accent. The breeze stirs the round man’s shock of thick hair as he leans forward eagerly.\n"
"“This is the first one ever! Everyone in the Vale’s pulled out all the stops so everyone feels welcome. We’re just so excited to have visitors!” The young man laughs as your truck crests the hilltop. Hemlock Isle stretches away in every direction.\n"
"To the south, glistening black lakes dot a tangled marsh all the way to the coast. Up north, whitecapped hills gather around jutting obsidian rocks, resembling an exposed spine. Past a huddle of hills, the dense western forest grows up the rocky hillside, bisected by a wide river. And even further north, past the white hills, is a bleak rocky coastline at the edge of the slatey Atlantic waters.\n"
"The road takes you past lush farmland into a village nestled in the hills. Gaudy floral arrangments and brilliant ribbons hang from rooftops and fenceposts. A prismatic rainbow shimmers in a cloudless sky, lending the scene an idyllic air. As the truck rolls to a stop in the crossroads, locals and children in white-gold cloaks and wooden animal masks gather around you, grinning from ear to ear.\n"
"“Willkommen!” An imposing woman with steel-gray hair and a white-gold cloak cuts through the crowd. “Welcome to Hemlock Vale. I am Mother Rachel, and these are my people. What brings you here?”"

"<blockquote><fancy>1926年6月</fancy>\n"
"1926年6月，米斯卡塔尼克大學實地調查。成員：馬爾克斯、馬斯格雷夫，及其他人員。\n"
"經由三個米斯卡塔尼克大學的委員會分別進行評估後，我們獲准前往赫姆拉克島進行調查。我們的嚮導帶領我們，經由他稱為“堤道”的天然陸橋，這座陸橋只有在退潮時才能通過。最後我們抵達一個叫做艾灣的小漁村。柏蒂拿著那種狀似水仙的花朵的素描及照片四處詢問當地人，但他們似乎沒有見過這種花，或也許是因為柏蒂嚇到他們了，他有點過於興奮了。\n"
"這趟實地調查的成員有我，我的助理柏蒂．馬斯格雷夫，還有一些阿米蒂奇博士的聯絡人，他堅持我必須帶上這些人，甚至把它列為申請獲准的條件之一，我只希望他們不會妨礙到我。這座島是私人產業，而且已經禁止訪客有好一陣子了，直到現在。當地人在整個新英格蘭大肆宣傳即將在此舉辦的盛大慶典，遠至南方的波士頓與阿卡姆都聽到了這個消息。\n"
"艾灣鎮中沒有可以留宿的地方，而且根據當地人的說法，在島上野營是一件危險的事。我試著從他們口中追問更多有關危險的詳情，但他們不願再透露更多細節，不過我還是設法取得了島上的地圖，還有一些基本的補給品。我們放棄借宿的想法，準備在艾灣鎮西邊搭帳篷。但就在這時，一名叫做西奧的年輕男性向我們伸出援手，他說有座叫“鐵杉谷”的村莊可以提供我們住宿的地方。\n"
"<right><fancy>蘿莎．馬爾克斯博士</fancy></right>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"“說真的，我覺得你們一定會愛上那兒的！”西奧的聲音從卡車的窗戶中傳來。馬爾克斯博士闔上她手中的調查日誌，抬頭看向天空，她大約40歲，皮膚黝黑，有運動員般勻稱的身材。西奧繼續說：“我認識的人中，沒人不愛赫姆拉克島的。我不懂為什麼之前大家都不邀請人上島，我猜你們是為了盛宴而來的對吧。”\n"
"“這個盛宴是當地的傳統嗎？”柏蒂用他清脆的英國腔問到。他渾圓的身體興致勃勃地向前傾，微風吹起他一縷濃密的髮絲。\n"
"“這是有史以來第一次！谷裡的大家都使出了渾身解數，要讓客人們感覺賓至如歸，我們都很興奮，終於有人要來拜訪我們了！”年輕人說話的同時，你們的卡車正爬上一座山丘，在山丘頂，整座赫姆拉克島盡收你們眼底。\n"
"南邊，一大片植披糾纏的沼澤一路延伸到海岸線，其中有座湖泊，黑色的水面反射著光芒。北方如白浪起伏的山丘之間，一座座黑耀巨岩如脊柱般從中突出。越過西面的山丘群後，是一座廣袤的森林，從礫石密布的山丘地帶一路生長，中央被一道寬闊的河流一分為二。在更遙遠的北方，越過白色山丘，就是岩石組成的海岸線，平靜的大西洋海水拍打著荒涼陡峭的岸崖。\n"
"你們在鬱鬱蔥蔥的田園中行駛，一路駛向座落在山丘之間的村莊。你們路過精心布置的花園，屋頂與柵欄上處處可見精緻的緞帶裝飾，一道彩虹高掛在晴朗無雲的天空，形成一幅田園詩集般的美麗風景。你們的卡車在十字路口停下，當地的大人跟小孩們都穿著白金相間的外衣，戴著木製的動物面具。他們圍繞在你們身邊，帶著燦爛的笑容歡迎你們。\n"
"“歡迎！”一名氣質出眾的女性從人群中走出，她有一頭鐵灰色的頭髮，同樣披著白金相間的外衣。“歡迎來到鐵杉谷，我是瑞秋主母，這些是我的人民。什麼風把你們吹來的呢？”"

"The matron smiles benevolently. “And we are overjoyed to have you. Our food and shelter are yours. The Feast is in three days’ time; we ask only that you open your heart and mind to experience our way of life.”\n"

msgstr "那位女士慈祥的微笑了。“我們誠摯歡迎你們，我們的食物跟住處都將與你們共享。盛宴會持續三天，你們只要敞開心胸，體驗我們的生活方式，就是對我們最好的回報。”馬爾克斯博士對你們投來銳利的目光，然後拄著拐杖傾身向前。“其實，我們是為了米斯卡塔尼克大學的實地調查而來。”"

"Mother Rachel’s friendly mask breaks for just a moment as she registers your response. “Surveyers. I see. You are quite welcome here as well. But mind your place. We have rules. Do not harm anyone in the Vale and we will not harm you. Keep to the village at night, and take care out in the wilderness. Nature is crueller here.”\n"
"Down the road, a small doe walks alongside a pair of children, almost as if to contradict the matron’s words. Before you can ask her more, a gaggle of locals descend on the truck, eager for news from the mainland. After fielding multiple questions about sports outcomes and elections, Dr. Marquez suggests you split up to acquaint yourselves with the locals. “Ask around about the island and meet back here in an hour.”"
msgstr "聽到你們的來意時，瑞秋主母友善的面具有一瞬間消失了，但立刻又恢復如常。“原來是調查員，我懂了。你們同樣受到歡迎，但請注意言行，我們有自己的規矩。只要你們不對谷民們造成麻煩，我們同樣也不會對你們造成困擾。晚上最好待在村莊裡，在荒野中要小心，這裡的大自然是很嚴酷的。”在路的另一端，你們看見一隻小母鹿自在地走在兩個孩子身旁，這個畫面似乎與這位女士所說的有些出入。但在你們能進一步詢問她前，興奮的居民們已經湧了上來，迫切的想知道來自大陸上的消息。你們滿足了幾個關於運動比賽跟選舉的問題後，馬爾克斯博士提議所有人分頭行動，跟當地人們建立關係。“問問有關這座島上的事，一小時後回來這裡會合。”"

Dust swirls in the harsh light through the intricate stained glass. “I suppose if I had to put it simply: We all are. ‘Begotten by light,’ I often say. Like heavenly bodies, we each have a place in this life, a purpose. There are some whose place is to understand.

My ma’s always busy cooking for Auntie Rachel,” he scratches a red, raised swirl of hardened skin on his neck. “Auntie Rachel said we’d get 5 lashes if we litter in the Vale.” You ask him about any points of interest on the island. “You’re not allowed to go to the mines up in Pearl Ridge.

You note the worn copy of Walden under his arm, and ask about any local points of interest. “I know it’s rather unconventional, but my family’s old house has a...peculiar infestation,” he seems to chew his own words. “If you could exterminate whatever it is rather than study it, I think we’d all be in your debt.”"

"旅店的屋簷上掛滿了花圈，一陣肉香從前門飄出：是肉派與啤酒的香味。店主介紹自己是奧姆斯德太太，並給了你們住宿的房間。“村裡發生的大小事都逃不過我的眼睛，如果你們想多了解谷民們，我很樂意幫忙。”當你們詢問啤酒是從哪來時，她輕蔑的揮揮手說：“別跟我提什麼禁酒令，赫姆拉克島有自己的規矩。”她說完後瞥了一眼門廊外面，“除非，有人太不上道。”\n"
"你們看向門廊外，有一位黑棕色皮膚的窈窕人影坐在門外，那人看不出男女，穿著一身時尚的洋裝，襯金白袍隨意地披在肩上，手中拿著一個刺繡圓環，正在繡著一朵花的圖樣。柏蒂羞澀地拿著幾張吸引你們來到這的照片跟素描，上前詢問。"

"Dozens of workers bustle around the base of a large tree in the center of the Crossroads. The many faces of the tree leer down at you with myriad expressions: some laughing, others pinched in grief, or terror. Each expression is grotesquely exaggerated. When you ask one of the nearby carpenters about the tree, they pause to consider their words. “This tree is the effigy. A likeness of—well, maybe it’s best to think of it as a heavenly spirit. The same spirit that lives on in each of us.”\n"

"The small chapel atop the Vale’s northern hill has a hushed, stately air. Small buds have been grafted in such a way as to suggest the planks themselves are blooming. While you admire the strange phenomenon, two women in white-gold cloaks approach. You ask them more about the chapel and their faith, and they usher you inside. A stylized quilt at the back portrays a warped, many-armed mythological being with numerous eyes and wings. “We built this chapel some twenty years ago, but it didn’t see much use until our revival. Mother Rachel has always called us ‘Children of the Stars.’ I suppose this is one such star.”\n"

We can split up to cover more ground, or we can stick together. Theo has volunteered to drive us anywhere we need to go, and even said we could take his truck at night—though we aren’t to tell Mother Rachel. Given the stories of deadly wildlife, I’ve hired Judith to accompany me to Eastwick Bog. Either of you are welcome to join. Just be back by sundown.”\n"
