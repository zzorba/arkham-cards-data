"You are sitting in the small kitchen of the Peters family home in Akwan, on the north shore of Hemlock Isle. Cold Atlantic seawater laps at the stilts below the house as Helen Peters sets her steaming mug on the table. “The north shore caverns are a death trap,” she says firmly. “I don’t think you know what you’re getting into.”\n"
"You tell her you are well aware of the danger. According to local rumors, some folks have gone missing recently. The most recent disappearance was Helen’s sister, so you paid a visit to the Peters home to offer your help.\n"
"Helen looks you over, as if sizing you up, and finally nods. “Alright then. You’re either brave, or you’re stupid. Or you’re both, like my little brother.” She rubs her brow in frustration. “I last saw Lizzie—Elizabeth—taking a walk with our dog Bruce along the coastline. I told her to stay away from those caves, but she never listens. It’s easy to get lost in ‘em and there are things in there that’d haunt your nightmares.” She sets a flashlight on the table. “But that’s where we’re going to start.”"

"你們坐在彼得斯一家的小廚房中，這裡是他們在艾灣鎮的房子，就在赫姆拉克島的北海岸線上，冰冷的大西洋海水拍打在架高的支柱上。海倫．彼得斯將她冒著煙的馬克杯放在桌上，開口說：“北海岸的洞穴跟死亡陷阱沒兩樣。”她用堅定的語氣說到。“我不認為你們知道自己在幹什麼。”\n"
"你們告訴她你們很清楚潛在的危險性，根據當地人的說法，最近有許多人失蹤，最近一個失蹤的就是海倫的妹妹，所以你們才來到彼得斯家，表示幫忙的意願。\n"
"海倫盯著你們，像是在打量你們的本事，最後終於點頭：“好吧。你們要不是很勇敢；就是很愚蠢，也許兩者皆是，就跟我的弟弟一樣。”她挫折的揉著眼眶。“我最後一次看到麗莎，就是伊麗莎白，是她帶著我們的狗，布魯斯，去海邊散步的時候。我警告她要離那些洞窟遠點，但她從來不聽。人們在裡面很容易迷失方向，更別說還有那些會讓你做惡夢的恐怖東西。”她拿出一個手電筒放到桌上。“但我們還是必須從那裡開始。”"

"You follow Helen outside and onto the creaking boardwalks of Akwan village. Nestled in a small, rocky bay on the island’s northern shore, Akwan has been the home of Abenaki families and former whalers for generations. The steady swell and break of seawater on the stony shore lends the scene an eerie disquiet. Helen grabs a harpoon from a whaler’s shack and leads you to the beach.\n"
"A familiar old pickup truck slows to a stop nearby. Theo steps out and greets you with a broad smile. “I’m back! I had to run back to the Vale for something,” he waves. His smile vanishes when he sees Helen.\n"
"“I’m surprised you came,” Helen says cooly.\n"
"Theo looks crestfallen. “Of course I came, sis. How could I not?”\n"
"His sister says nothing as she strides past you both toward the bleak shoreline. A curl of waves crashes against the walk, breaking the apparent drama of the moment. You ask Theo for the reason behind his sister’s chilly response, and he looks distant for a moment.\n"
"“Y’know, sometimes people just grow apart. Like two branches. They’ll always be connected, but they—” The extended metaphor is interrupted by Helen, calling you to the mouth of a seaside cave."

"你們跟著海倫走過艾灣鎮破裂的濱海木板道。艾灣鎮座落在島嶼北邊一個窄小、岩石嶙峻的海灣中，這裡世代以來都是阿本拿基族跟前捕鯨人們的家。海水規律的漲退擊打在岩岸上，為這裡添增了令人毛骨悚然的氛圍。海倫手中拿著從捕鯨人小屋借來的魚叉，引領你們走向海灘。\n"
"一輛熟悉的卡車緩緩停靠在附近，西奧帶著燦爛的笑容向你們揮手招呼：“我回來了！我剛才得回谷地一趟。”他一看見海倫，臉上的笑容瞬間消失。\n"
"“我很驚訝你會來。”海倫冷冷地說。\n"
"西奧垂頭喪氣地說：“我當然會來了，老姊，我怎麼能不來？”\n"
"海倫一言不發的大步走過你們跟西奧的身邊，朝昏暗的海岸線走去。一道浪尖打在步道上，短暫打破了僵硬的氣氛。你問西奧為什麼他的姊姊反應如此冷淡，他沉默地望向遠方一會兒。\n"
"“你們懂的，有時候人們會漸行漸遠，像是同一棵樹木上的樹枝，它們永遠血脈相連，但朝向 — ”他的比喻被海倫打斷，她在海邊的洞窟口叫喚著你們。"

"As you and Helen make preparations to leave, the sound of rain breaks the silence. Theo steps through the front door, brushing his wet hair out of his face. He locks eyes with Helen. “So she’s still not back,” he says soberly. Theo drips rainwater on the weatherbeaten floor as Helen glowers at him. “I’m surprised you came, little brother. Better late than never, I guess. Get the rope.” She slings a harpoon over her shoulder and walks out into the pouring rain. Theo scrambles for rope and a second flashlight as you ask him what the matter is.\n"
"“Our sister is missing. I told Helen she would come back, and now it’s been two days. That’s, uh. That’s what the matter is.”"

"就在你們和海倫準備離開時，雨滴落下的聲音打破了寂靜。西奧踏進門，將被打濕的髮絲撥到一邊。“所以她還是沒回來。”他嚴肅地說，一邊將滴水的雨衣放在飽經風霜的地板上。海倫怒視著他：“我很驚訝你來了，弟弟。也許遲到的確比不到好吧。去拿繩子。”說完海倫便揹上一支魚叉，走進傾盆大雨之中。西奧拖著腳步去拿繩子跟第二支手電筒時，你們問他出了什麼事。\n"

I thought this could be our home, but I guess it’s just another stop on the way,” Helen says wistfully. The village is all but deserted, save for an old sailor in a navy blue coat. He nearly drops his fishing rod as you approach.\n"
"“Gideon! Fishing again?” Helen says with a wry smile.\n"
"The old sailor pulls his haul out of the water. “Nae but an ugly cod. An’ this e’en uglier haddock.” The fish strung through the twine have too many fins and spined, barnacle-like growths. “An ye, Helen?” Gideon asks.\n"

"“吉迪恩！又來釣魚啊？”海倫苦笑著說。\n"
"老水手把他的竿子從水中拉出“哼，只是條醜魚，從沒看過這麼醜的鱈魚。”被魚線串起的那條魚有著許多不正常的魚鰭跟尖刺，類似藤壺的東西長滿全身。“嗯？是海倫嗎？”吉迪恩問。\n"

The night sky is dreary and overcast, but an unsettling glimmer lingers over the southern horizon: a distant, shifting luminescence of blues and greens beyond the treetops.

"“I’ll start making preparations soon and hopefully we’ll be off the island in a few more days,” Helen tells you. “I suggest you leave soon, as well.” You tell her the survey is far from over, and there’s still more you have to do. Helen scoffs. “Your funeral,” she says, then after a brief silence she looks at you again. “Sorry. I don’t know why I said that,” she says. “Thank you for your help. Nobody from the Vale would have helped.” She looks down the black sanded shore toward Akwan. “Gideon used to fish here often, but not anymore. The Vale took him from us. Now they’ve taken Theo.”\n"
"She looks back to you. “I have another favor to ask. Please. Look after Theo. He means well, even if he’s a little thick in the head. Make sure he’s okay. No matter what he thinks, he’s still family.”"

"“我會開始打包，希望幾天內就可以離開這座島。”海倫對你們說。“我建議你們也趕緊離開。”你們說調查還遠遠沒結束，還有很多事要辦。海倫嗤之以鼻：“那你們就等著辦自己的葬禮吧。”一陣短暫的沉默後，她說：“我很抱歉，我不知道自己為什麼要這樣說。我很感激你們的幫助，谷地裡的那些人從不願意伸出援手。”她看著艾灣的黑色沙灘，“吉迪恩以前很常來這裡釣魚，但現在他不再來了。谷地把他從我們身邊奪走，現在連西奧也被帶走了。”\n"
"她轉向你們：“我得拜託你們另一件事，請關照一下西奧。他心地善良，但有時候很固執，幫我照顧好他。不管他怎麼想，他依然是我們的家人。”"
