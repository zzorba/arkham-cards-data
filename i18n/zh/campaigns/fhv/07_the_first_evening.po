"As you return to Hemlock Vale, a young red-headed girl in a rabbit mask introduces herself as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter, and leads you by the hand to dinner in the Commons. The long building’s large barn doors are open to let out the rich scent of roasted vegetables and savory meat. The people of the Vale sit and eat in lively conversation, each of them in their white-gold cloaks. At the head of the room, Mother Rachel stands up and calls for attention. Rebecca leads you to the now-picked-over dinner spread as the room falls silent.\n"
"“<i>Meine lieben Freunde.</i> What a blessing that all of us have come here, on the threshold of infinity. And what a greater blessing still that pilgrims have come here, so full of light and curiosity!” Mother Rachel gestures to Dr. Marquez to her right, and to you. “We have waited for the right moment to open our community. Our community which is truly the ‘Sanctuary of Transfiguration’ we long dreamed of. For each of us yearns to be remade as we wait to join our light with the light of the cosmos.”\n"
"The room bursts into applause as Leah Atwood and several locals place trays of honeyed cakes topped with robust red fruit in the center of each table. Your stomach grumbles as you take a bite of shriveled greens. It has a faint bitter taste, and a sharp smell."

"你們回到鐵杉谷，一個帶著兔子面具的紅髮女孩向你們自我介紹，她叫蕾貝卡，瑞秋主母的女兒。她牽著你們的手到城鎮大堂用晚餐，這棟長方形的建築是由穀倉改建而成的，烤蔬菜跟烤肉的香味從大開著的穀倉大門傳進你們的鼻子。谷地的人們穿著襯金白袍，坐在一起用餐，一邊熱絡的聊著天。在主桌的首座，瑞秋主母站起身，準備發言，就在蕾貝卡帶你們夾取晚餐時，整座大堂安靜了下來。\n"
"“親愛的親朋好友，以無垠之名，賜予我們恩惠，讓我們能齊聚一堂。朝聖者們也加入我們，為我們添增祝福，他們是多麼充滿光明與好奇心！”瑞秋主母揮手示意坐在她右手邊的馬爾克斯博士，以及你們其他人。“我們已經等待了許久，等候正確的時機開放我們的社區，我們長久以來夢想將社區打造成‘昇變聖所’，因為我們每個人都渴望能重塑自我，耐心等待著將我們的榮光與宇宙之光合而為一。”\n"

I attended seances with Sarah Winchester, studied mesmerism in France, and became a member of the Ghost Club in London. Everywhere I studied, I learned more and more of our connectedness. Our many-faceted oneness. And so I brought my learning home, to my family, where it always belonged.”"

My grandfather Wilbur commanded dozens of whaling vessels. But his pride and joy was the Annabelle Lee.” He looks forlornly at his elderly mother. “Naturally, it sank. As did the profits from the whaling industry. My grandfather blamed it all on some kind of curse. He believed in it so strongly that he locked my poor mother in the attic of our family home for weeks at a time.”\n"

"居民們如細流般逐漸離開大堂，這場傍晚集會進入了尾聲。你們在大堂外集合，你發現馬爾克斯博士的腳步中帶有一絲雀躍，與她嚴肅的形象有點格格不入。夕陽在天空中投下紅褐色的影子，然後逐漸轉為淡紫，最後是如紫羅蘭般的深紫色。教授剝著一把核桃，你們分享著關於這座島的印象。\n"
"“這座島的植被茂密度跟生物多樣性幾乎跟熱帶叢林相當，但比任何叢林都更加危險。我不懂為什麼會有人想在這麼惡劣的環境中建立社區。但我得知這裡不是一直都如此危險，有某種東西滲入了這裡的生態系統，從根源造成了影響。”馬爾克斯博士陷入沉思。\n"
"你提起村莊中的異樣，人們的心情愉悅的很不自然，教授點頭同意：“幾乎所有人都處於極樂狀態，就像走進鴉片館一樣。但以我目前的觀察，食物沒有被加入什麼東西，雖然我沒有吃那個麵包布丁。我不喜歡麵包，上次吃布丁也是在牛津的事了。”\n"
"教授提到這所知名大學，讓你想起了柏蒂．馬斯格雷夫，好奇他在哪裡。\n"
"“你也沒看到他？我想他應該回去旅店休息了。”教授臉色陰沉地說。“西奧說晚上可以把卡車借給我們，我們可以觀察一些當地的夜行生物，但我想我們該先找到他。”\n"
"一陣大風吹拂過你們身旁的樹木跟青草，帶來松柏的氣味。馬爾克斯博士拿起拐杖說：“如果你想開卡車去調查，我可以自己去找柏蒂。”"
