"Anette approaches, confronting the remnant's ethereal shell. \"Sister! We are the ones who have called you here from the great beyond.\" The shattered revenant turns its attention to Anette, and the rest of her coven watch in anticipation.\n"
"\"What are you doing, you fool? This spirit is no mere witch!\" Carl Sanford yells out. But it is too late. Anette ignores Sanford, continuing to speak to the spectral presence. \"For years we have suffered injustice after injustice. Share with me your secrets, sister. Together, as one mind, body, and soul, we can begin anew.\"\n"
"The ghost reaches out to her with a long, skeletal arm. Anette's sisters gasp as their high priestess steps forward and kneels before the being, offering herself. With a sudden rush of energy, the phantom soul is drawn inside Anette. She collapses to the ground, reeling from the spiritual impact. Her body writhes in torment, but none of the other witches step forward to help, instead watching with equal parts terror and fascination. Finally, Anette rises to her feet, her eyes aglow with mystical power. When she speaks, it is not her voice. \"Sisters. Rejoice, for I am reborn,\" Keziah says.\n"
"Carl Sanford taps you with his cane. You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn't noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge's inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. \"We must leave this place at once,\" Sanford says stoically. \"This being posses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.\"\n"
"Anette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. \"You look famililar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.\" She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul… but perhaps this is the chance you have been waiting for?"

"安妮特走上前來，面對著亡靈那縹緲的身體。“姐姐！是我們將你從遙遠的地方呼唤到這兒的。”撕裂的亡靈注意到了安妮特，其他女巫也投去了期盼的目光。\n"
"“你在幹什麼？你這蠢貨！這個鬼魂已經不止是女巫了！”卡爾·桑福德大聲吼道。但已經太晚了。安妮特不顧桑福德的叫喊，繼續對那鬼魂說：“這些年來我們遭受了一次又一次的不公。把你的秘密分享給我吧，姐姐。來吧，讓我們合二為一，精神、肉體、靈魂都融於一體，重新開始。”\n"
"那幽靈對她伸出一根瘦長的枯骨手臂。安妮特的姐妹們呼吸急促，看著自己的女祭司步上前去，跪在鬼魂面前，獻出自己的肉體。一股力量突然湧出，那鬼魂被安妮特吸入體內。她精神受到衝擊，一陣眩暈倒在地上。她身體痛苦地扭動著，但其他女巫沒有一人上前施救，而是全都看著她，面帶恐懼與陶醉。最後，安妮特站起身來，眼睛閃耀著神秘力量的光芒。她說話時已不是她原來的噪音。“姐妹們。慶祝我的重生吧。”凱夏說道。\n"
"卡爾·桑福德用手杖輕輕碰你。你被眼前發生的事情驚呆了，全然沒有注意到秘社的成員正悄悄離開這片空地。一名秘社核心圈成員舉起左輪手槍，想要開槍，但女祭司只注視著他，他的手臂便在你眼前萎縮、腐爛。他手槍咔嗒掉落在地，發出最後一聲嚎叫，最後他歸於虛無，只在地上剩下一個腐爛的軀殼。“我們必須馬上離開這裡。”桑福德堅定地說，“那鬼魂掌握著高於生死本身的力量。我們再也沒法傷她分毫。”\n"
"安妮特——不，是凱夏——轉向你，雙眼閃耀著光芒。“你看起來很熟悉，孩子。來吧，過來。別害怕。你不需要害怕我。”她居心叵測地獰笑著，聲音像是尖刀一般刺進你的靈魂……但也許這就是你等待已久的良機？"

"You step forward and meet Keziah's gaze. This is what you have prepared for. All your research, all the mysteries you have uncovered, it has all led you here. To power. To immortality. Keziah nods knowingly. A sinister smirk frolics on her lips. \"Come, sisters. Now is the time to reap the reward for your loyalty.\"\n"
"Outmatched, Carl Sanford and the Lodge members flee into the woods, leaving you and the coven alone. One by one, you and your new allies each sign the Black Book of Azathoth. Keziah grants you each a shred of her knowledge, of her power, and then she tells you what your loyalty has bought. She speaks of the Great Old Ones, of immortality, of the Messenger and their daemonic wisdom. From henceforth, you are forever changed…"

"你走上前去，迎上了凱夏的目光。你準備的一切，就是為了這一刻。你所有的研究，揭開的所有秘密都引領你來到這裡。力量。不朽。凱夏會意地點點頭，嘴角勾起一抹邪惡的微笑。“過來吧，姐妹們。是時候收割你們忠誠的獎勵了。”\n"
"卡爾·桑福德和秘社成員們不堪一擊，逃進了樹林，只留下了你和女巫集會。你和你的新盟友一個個簽下了阿撒托斯的黑書。凱夏賜予你們每人一丁點兒她的知識，一丁點兒她的力量。接著，她告訴你們，你們的忠誠帶來了什麼。她提到了舊日支配者，提到了不朽，提到了信使和它們惡魔般的智慧。從現在起，你將永遠改變……"

"You hate to admit it, but Sanford is right. You cannot play a part in this folly. But the moment such thoughts cross your mind, Keziah's expression turns to ice. \"So be it.\" She stretches out her hand. In terror, you flee with the rest of the Lodge, hoping you are fast enough to escape the witch's magic.\n"
"Your escape is a blur. Witches and spirits chase you relentlessly through the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. Other members of the Lodge are perhaps not so fortunate. Having scattered in many directions, you're not sure how many of them escaped, and you don't see Carl Sanford anywhere. Still, you suspect he had a plan for this outcome."

"你不想承認，但桑福德說得對。你不能過去。不能做這樣的蠢事。但這個念頭剛劃過你的腦海，凱夏的表情就冷了下來。“好吧。”她伸出了手。你驚恐地和秘社成員們一起逃跑，只盼自己能跑快些，從那女巫的魔力之下逃脫。\n"
"你在濃霧的掩護下逃走了。女巫和幽靈在荒涼的樹林裡無情地追趕著你。你勉強跑到岸邊，險些就要被他們追上。其他的秘社成員或許就沒這麼幸運了。你和他們分頭逃跑，不確定他們有多少人逃出去了，而你到處都看不見卡爾·桑福德的蹤影，但你猜測他對現在的局勢早有對策。"
