msgid "Despite all odds, humanity survived the second apocalypse. Beneath the light of new stars and amidst the dust of the dead, humanity enters a golden era of scientific development and prosperity. When the white dwarf that used to be the sun extinguishes, mankind will have colonized half a galaxy worth of stars. Some of the worlds will succumb to the madness of the Ancient Ones, but most will survive — and thrive. And yet, after billions and billions of years, the net entropy of the universe continues to increase, slowly and steadily. The stars go dim, one by one, until what the beings that descended from what was once humanity must survive by extracting the negligible amount of radiation released by the only celestial bodies remaining in the universe — black holes. And still, after a finite but uncountable time, even the black holes will evaporate…"

msgid "Humanity may have perished along with its star, but not all life in the universe is aligned with the Ancients Ones. The fungoid Mi-Go scientists escaped the solar system with the infinite trove of knowledge they collected from observing the humans. The descendants of the Mi-Go would live on, and colonize many galaxies in search of more knowledge to satisfy their ravenous curiosity. And yet, after billions and billions of years, the net entropy of the universe continues to increase, slowly and steadily. The stars go dim, one by one, until what the beings that descended from what was once the Mi-Go must survive by extracting the negligible amount of radiation released by the only celestial bodies remaining in the universe — black holes. And still, after a finite but uncountable time, even the black holes will evaporate…"

msgid "And when all the black holes do disappear, and all that is left is a vacuum of vastly separated photons and electrons, life in the cosmos will cease to exist. Our universe succumbs to a cold and empty death, leaving behind a world of maximum decay and infinite dark matter — A world that was once known to some as Carcosa."

msgid "the realm of Carcosa overtook our universe, and Tassilda rules over the black stars."

msgid "But humanity is not alone. They have encountered countless alien species throughout the universe and shared their knowledge and advancements towards finding a way to reverse entropy. The final piece of the puzzle was information that had been collected by the Mi-Go scientists of Yuggoth — the data within six human brains that once populated a kindergarten class on Earth, before the Ancient Ones first awakened. And thus, with the essential help of the Mi-Go, the Royal Family of Carcosa was imprisoned in their mad realm of Carcosa once more, and yellow stars rise again in the rebirth of a brighter universe."

"Hope you enjoyed this campaign! Creating it was quite a journey! This campaign originally began as a 3-part campaign, consisting of The Tatterdemalion, Electric Nightmare and Starfall, but I quickly realized, along with a few playtesters, that the setting and story was too interesting to leave so quickly.\n"
"The framework of Arkham Horror LCG is really a medium to tell stories in — and I knew that deep space sci-fi horror is a genre deeply connected to Lovecraftian themes and would have to be explored by custom scenarios eventually. I originally did not want to make it because it would have been very simple for a sci-fi themed campaign to stray in tone from the Arkham Files universe, but when I finally figured out a way to bring the investigators into the future that wasn't too ridiculous, and how to incorporate the mythos in a way that fits the universe without being too obvious, I just had to create the campaign. The King in Yellow is my favourite Ancient One, with the way it plays with psychological horror and perception of reality, with a certain theatrical flare, and the Path to Carcosa is my favourite campaign released so far, so it was only natural for a virtual reality-bending memory-involved campaign to become a loose sequel to the Path to Carcosa. Hastur is not the Ancient One most would associate with deep space, which is precisely why it fits so well.\n"
"I hope this campaign satisfies the need for a deep space sci-fi campaign. I tried to incorporate as many sci-fi tropes that are to be expected from a \"sci-fi\" campaign organically as possible while keeping the tone and writing style of FFG's stories. I do hope more people will explore the story space of sci-fi with the Arkham framework, perhaps even further in the future than I have, maybe something closer to a space-opera? Or even a pure adaptation of the Alien series. But for now, that will be it from me in this grim future setting.\n"
"Anyways, I do hope you all enjoyed this campaign. Alas, it's time to work on the next one, whenever I have free time, in these <i>dark ages</i>."
