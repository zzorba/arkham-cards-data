msgid "Scenario IV: The Machine in Yellow"
msgstr ""

msgid "You awaken with a start, as though shaken by an unseen force. There are only a few other patrons in the audience, and no performers on stage. The lights are dimmed, and the stage curtains are tattered and ripped. A foul but unrecognizable smell permeates the air. You are back in the Ward theatre — where it all began. Is this an artifact of your memory? Or have you been dreaming this entire time? Shaking off your drowsiness, you call out into the air for K2-PS187. To your relief, and slight disappointment, the digitalized voices respond in confirmation that the procedure behaved as planned. You have arrived inside of your own mind…"

msgid "You had a dream. A vivid, lucid and all-too real dream. You escaped the Ward theatre into the rainy streets of Arkham. You would visit the after-party of the dreadful King in Yellow, and embark along a grand and mind-bending adventure across Arkham which eventually leads to France and into Carcosa itself. When you finally wake up in cold sweat back in the cryo-chamber, you almost forgot the new reality you had found yourself in. Although the ordeal has been difficult and took much longer than you anticipated, you have finally unlocked that part of your memories that has been kept concealed by your other self — the ritual to locate the Fragment of Carcosa."

Without further ado, you quickly disconnect yourself from the virtual dreamlands and return to form in the Tatterdemalion, ready to confront Tassilda at long last."
