"You awaken, entombed in ice. Your skin, your organs, even your bones are cold. You can't move and it's hard to form coherent thoughts… A tingle of warmth slowly spreads through your veins…\n"
"When your eyelids finally thaw, all you see is a large pane of frosted glass. What is going on? Where are you? One moment, you were in the Ward Theatre, watching the tedious theatre performance, and the next, in a cryosleep chamber.\n"
"Cryosleep… Despite having never heard the word before, you instinctively know what this procedure must be. Your mind may not recollect, but your body has been through this cycle of freezing and thawing many times. The thought of being familiar with something so foreign to you disturbs you to the core.\n"
"When the warmth eventually reaches your fingers, the glass window slides open and releases you into a dark, metallic room. The control panel next to your tomb delivers its computerized announcement: \"Welcome back aboard the Tatterdemalion. The current star date is April 4, 2147.\" You look out the nearest window, only to witness a black canvas of infinite stars and a colossal cerulean sphere — the planet Neptune. The thought of drifting through the infinite expanse of space does not frighten you, for you have lived your entire life in space — not in your past life in Arkham, but in the person you embody now. As you begin wondering how much stranger this dream of yours can become, a loud blaring alarm echoes through the vacant ship…"

"Once again you are startled awake, this time by the small, cold hands of a young girl. \"It worked! You're here! Please, follow me quickly.\" You are surprised to find yourself standing in a field of grass. The sky is black and seething, the sun unable to penetrate the dark, rolling storm clouds… You are no longer on the Tatterdemalion, but you don't recognize this place either. Metallic cylinders with red, pulsating lights stand tall in the distance, looming above a small town. Behind you is a large obsidian door.\n"
"You ask the little girl about your whereabouts. \"You are in a simulated dream. In fact, you are in <b>my</b> dream. Now follow me quickly before the monster eats my friends.\""
