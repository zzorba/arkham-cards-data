msgid "You and your partners have been investigating strange events taking place in your home city of Arkham, Massachusetts. Over the past few weeks, several townspeople have mysteriously gone missing. Recently, their corpses turned up in the woods, savaged and half-eaten. The police and newspapers have stated that wild animals are responsible, but you believe there is something else going on. You are gathered together at the lead investigator’s home to discuss these bizarre events."

msgid "You barely manage to escape your house with your lives. The woman from your parlor follows you out the front door, slamming it behind her. “You fools! See what you have done?” She pushes a chair in front of the door, lodging it beneath the doorknob. “We must get out of here. Come with me, and I will tell you what I know. We are the only ones who can stop the threat that lurks beneath from being unleashed throughout the city.” You’re in no state to argue. Nodding, you follow the woman as she runs from your front porch out into the rainy street, toward Rivertown."
msgstr "你们勉强保住性命逃出了这个房屋。客厅里的女人跟著你们走出了大门，然后把门重重关上。“你们这群白痴！看看你们干的好事！”她随手拿起一把椅子，抵在门把底下。“我们必须赶紧离开。跟我来，我会把我知道的一切告诉你们。那个潜伏在地底的威胁马上要蔓延到整个城市了，除了我们之外没人能够阻止它。”你们无暇多做争论，纷纷点头。跟著那个女人快速步入雨中的街道，向著河岸城走去。"

msgid "You nod and allow the red-haired woman to set the walls and floor of your house ablaze. The fire spreads quickly, and you run out the front door to avoid being caught in the inferno. From the sidewalk, you watch as everything you own is consumed by the flames. “Come with me,” the woman says. “You must be told of the threat that lurks below. Alone, we are surely doomed…but together, we can stop it.”"
msgstr "你点了点头，那个红发女人将手中的火炬丢在地上。霎时间，你的面前变成一片火海。为了不被火焰吞噬，你用尽全力跑出前门。你站在人行道上看著你所有的东西被火焰吞没。“跟我来吧，”那女人叹了一口气。“我想你们已经看到了地底的威胁之物。现在，是时候团结起来，去阻止这一切了。”"

msgid "You refuse to follow the overzealous woman’s order and kick her out of your home for fear that she will set it ablaze without your permission. “Fools! You are making a grave mistake!” she warns. “You do not understand the threat that lurks below… the grave danger we are all in!” Still shaken by the night’s events, you decide to hear the woman out. Perhaps she can shed some light on these bizarre events…but she doesn’t seem to trust you very much."
msgstr "你拒不服从那个疯女人的指示，并且把她赶出了你的家，生怕她再把甚么东西给烧了。“你们这群白痴！现在犯下的错误，以后就没有机会补偿了！”她试图警告你们。“你们根本不懂地底下的那个东西有多可怕……我们正面临著莫大的危险！”你们想到了刚才的事情，也许那个人说的是对的，她可能知道些你们不了解的内幕……不过她好像不太相信你们。"

msgid "You run to the hallway to try to find a way to escape the house, but the burning-hot barrier still blocks your path. Trapped, the horde of feral creatures that have invaded your home close in, and you have nowhere to run."
msgstr "你们跑到走廊，试图找到逃离这儿的方法，但是那个巨大而又滚烫的屏障依然挡著你们。你们现在已经被这些凶残的入侵者所包围，无处可逃。"
