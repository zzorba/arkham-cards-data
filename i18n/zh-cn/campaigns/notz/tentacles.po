"After a frantic nighttime search throughout Arkham, you have tracked down and questioned several members of the cult. Your findings are disturbing: they claim to worship a being known as Umôrdhoth, a monstrous entity from another realm.\n"
"You are able to confirm much of Lita’s story: the cult is agitated over the destruction of a ghoul lair. However, a surprising detail also turns up: the one who invaded the lair and set this night’s events in motion was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this important detail was omitted from Lita’s story—did she tell you only as much as was necessary to draw you into her conflict? But in another light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city of Arkham from a terrible menace.\n"
"The final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by one of the cultists. It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within the woods south of Arkham, this very night. According to the journal, the ritual’s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult’s dark master into this world. “If the cult is not stopped,” Lita warns, “there is a possibility that Umôrdhoth’s vengeance will consume all in its path.” Frightened but determined to stop the ritual, you head into the woods…"

"你们花了不少时间来搜索整个阿卡姆，终于在几名异教徒成员处，问出了一些信息。你们的发现令人不安：他们声称崇拜一个叫做“乌默尔多斯”的神，那是来自另一个世界的庞然大物。\n"
"现在，丽塔的故事终于和线索对上了：异教徒们对于食尸鬼巢穴被破坏十分气愤。然而事情又有点古怪：这样一来的话，破坏巢穴，并且参与午夜行动的人，只可能有一个——丽塔·钱德勒！可为什么呢？如果她的确做了这种事，又何必告诉你们，并与你们一起调查？难道她只是想骗取你们的信任和注意力？但是从另一个角度想，她的确是在保护阿卡姆免受灾难。\n"
"最后谜团的钥匙，在一名异教徒的日志中找到了。里面详细记录了一种仪式的执行方式，并提及举行地点就在阿卡姆南部的森林，时间就是今晚。根据日志纪载，当仪式完成时，地面的大门将打开，异教徒们黑暗的主人将来到这个世界。“如果不阻止这个仪式，”丽塔警告你们，“乌默尔多斯是永远不会满足的，它会吞噬所经过的一切。”你的心中充满恐惧，但事已至此，只能向森林进发……"

The creature’s tendrils spread throughout the city of Arkham, searching for her. It lurks in the darkness of every corner, tugging at the seams of reality. But Lita is nowhere to be found, so the creature dwells in the shadows to this day, searching… killing."
msgstr "丽塔满脸恐惧，他拒绝直面自己的命运，直接逃跑了。她意识到自己未能阻止仪式的进行，现在无论她去哪儿，乌默尔多斯都不会放过她的。那个生物将卷须布满阿卡姆的每个角落，拉扯现实的间隙。但丽塔已经没了踪影，所以那怪物一直藏身于阴影之中，不断寻找她……只为取她性命。"

msgid "You have managed to prevent the cult from summoning its master. Although you’re unsure what would have happened had the cult succeeded, you’re relieved that—at least for the time being—Arkham is safe. You capture as many cultists as you can find, but very few townspeople believe your tale. Perhaps it was all in your head, after all."
msgstr "你成功阻止了邪教的仪式，召唤被迫中止。尽管你不太确定如果他们完成仪式会发生什么，不过你觉得还是不要知道比较好，起码阿卡姆会是安全的。你抓住了不少邪教成员，可惜大家还是不愿意相信你的故事。也许这一切只是一场梦，谁知道呢。"

msgid "Through force of arms and strength of will, you are somehow able to harm Umôrdhoth enough to send it reeling back to the dimension from which it emerged. Warmth and light return to the woods as the void-like mass is sucked in upon itself, vanishing in an instant. You aren’t sure if a being such as this can be killed, but for the time being it seems to have retreated. As their master vanishes, the ghouls nearby climb into the open pit below, fleeing with terrible cries and shrieks. You have stopped an evil plot, but the fight has taken its toll on your body and mind. Worse, you can’t help but feel insignificant in the face of the world’s mysteries. What other terrors exist in the deep, dark corners of reality?"
msgstr "你的手腕强劲，你的意志坚定，你在乌默尔多斯身上留下了不少伤痕，足以让它滚回异世界去了。那怪物收起了触手，带著刺眼的光，一瞬间消失在森林中，阳光重新洒在地面上。你不太清楚是否有办法杀死那个怪物，但起码现在它已经撤退了。现在它们的主人已经离去，那些地上的食尸鬼们哭嚎著逃回了地下。这一晚，你已经目睹了太多可怕的事实，乌默尔多斯的身影，将永远折磨你的肉体和精神。更惨的是，你忍不住去想这个世界的真相是什么。既然能够存在这样的怪物，那么在现实深处的黑暗角落之中，是否还有你所不知道的其他怪物呢？"

msgid "In the face of this horror, you don’t believe there is anything you can do to stop it. You have but one hope if you are to survive. You turn on Lita and throw her at the terrible monstrosity, watching in dread as its swirling void-like mass consumes her. She cries out in torment as the life is sucked from her body. “Umôrdhoth…Umôrdhoth…” the cultists chant. Lita Chantler vanishes without a trace. For a moment, you fear that the creature will now turn on you, but you hear one of the cultists say, “Umôrdhoth is a just god who claims only the guilty and the dead. Go, and you shall be spared.” The swirling mass vanishes, and warmth and light return to the woods. The cultists slink away, leaving you alive. Lita’s last moments are forever etched upon your memory."
msgstr "面对这个世界中最黑暗的恐惧，你万念俱灰。你最后的愿望就是活著。你转向了丽塔，将她一把推向那个恐怖的怪物，你恐惧地看著她被那团虚空的漩涡吞噬。她痛苦地哭喊，转瞬间便失去了生命。“乌默尔多斯……乌默尔多斯……”邪教徒们的咏唱声永不停息，但丽塔·钱德勒已经不见踪影。有那么一刻，你害怕那个怪物会向你冲来，但邪教徒中有一人说道：“乌默尔多斯是最公正的神，它只会带走有罪的人和复苏的死者。走吧，你已经被神宽恕了。”说完，那怪物渐渐消失了，温暖与阳光重回这片森林。异教徒们纷纷离开，而你们还活著。但是，丽塔死前扭曲的脸，已经永远无法被忘怀。"
