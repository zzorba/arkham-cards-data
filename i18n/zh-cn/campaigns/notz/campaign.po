"Friday, September 18, 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts. It is the end of a long and abnormally hot summer. The first hints of autumn beckon, but a heavy heat persists, relentless. A silent, unspoken anger grips the town. Tempers are short, and in the last week alone there have been numerous reports of townspeople coming to heated, violent blows with one another over simple misunderstandings.\n"
"And now, a call from James Hankerson. He claims to have found a dismembered body in his barn.\n"
"Blaming the weather would be too easy. There is something wrong with this town, and not a whole lot this old soothsayer can do to stop the slide. My auguries indicate a small group of investigators will soon take note of these strange happenings and set forth to make things right. I’ll be watching their progress… but I won’t be holding my breath."

"1925年9月18日，星期五，马萨诸塞州，阿卡姆市。漫长而又炎热的夏天，终于到了尽头。秋天还刚来没多久，酷热仍未退去。城里垄罩著一种寂静、无法言说的愤懑氛围。人们的脾气变得暴躁，仅在上周就有多不可计的报导指出，市民们对于小小误会反应激烈，动辄暴力相向。\n"
"现在，你接到了詹姆士·汉克森的来电。他说在谷仓里找到了一具被肢解的尸体。\n"
"你可以把责任都推卸给这鬼天气。不过市里的这种情况很不寻常，快要进入一种连求神问佛都不管用的程度。你决定相信自己的直觉，并快速招募了一只调查小队决定找到这一系列怪事的发生原因，将一切扭回正轨。我会一直盯著你们的进度……但我可不会坐以待毙。"
