msgid "The woman came to you in a panic, raving about monsters emerging from the ground in a home near Rivertown. “I managed to trap them,” she explains, “but there are others. Other pits. Other domains.” Only last week, you would have thought she was a lunatic. Recent events, however, have challenged your preconceptions of normality. You decide to hear her out. She introduces herself as Lita Chantler and lays out a tale that strains the limits of your belief. “The creatures I speak of ,” she claims, “are called ghouls—cruel beings who plague the crypts, caverns, and tunnels beneath the city of Arkham…”"

"突然有一个女人慌慌忙忙地向你们跑来，说什么在河岸城旁边的一座房子里，有一堆怪物不停地从地底下涌出。“我想要把它们都困住，”她解释道，“但是数量太多了。而且它们不只有这一个出口。”如果上周遇到她，你可能觉得她是疯子。但是现在看来，这可能与近期的事件有所关联，尽管这一切都难以想像。你决定让她把话说完。\n"
"原来她名叫丽塔·钱德勒，她说了一些超越你想像的事实。“我提到的这些生物，”她说，“叫做食尸鬼，它们就在阿卡姆市地下的墓穴、洞窟以及隧道之中作乱……”"

"“These creatures feed on the corpses of humans, and they are served by a dark cult within Arkham whose members have inexplicably come to worship the ancient master of the ghouls. This cult has been killing innocent people and feeding them to the ghouls, satiating a monstrous hunger. A dark balance was maintained. Until now. Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot fathom what to expect.\n"
"“Many of the cultists,” Lita continues, “will seem like everyday people, despite their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.”"

"“这些生物以吃人的尸体维生。在阿卡姆，有一个黑暗邪教组织，一直供奉著这些生物，他们崇信食尸鬼的远古之主。最近，教徒们杀了不少无辜的人，用来填满食尸鬼的无穷饥渴。以前，这些家伙只在暗处行动，避免被人发现。但是这段期间，”丽塔顿了顿，“一个用来囤放尸体的巢穴，被人破坏了。从那时起，食尸鬼就开始频繁地在地面活动。我跟踪过它们，也试著去阻止它们在市里到处乱跑。不过我想这件事不会这么单纯。教会的追求没有这么简单，他们想要的力量超过我的预料。今晚，他们就要完成计划了，时间就在午夜之后。不过具体会发生甚么，我也无法想像。”\n"
"“很多异教徒，”丽塔继续说道，“就隐藏在一般的民众之中，难以分辨。当教会召见时，他们就会戴上用动物头骨制成的面具，来隐藏其真实身分。这些面具象征著死亡和腐朽。我们必须揭开他们的假面，找出他们的计划。剩下的时间不太多了，午夜之前能找到的异教徒越多越好。”"
