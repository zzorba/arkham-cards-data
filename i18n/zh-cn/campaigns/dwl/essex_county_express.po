"Recent events in the Museum have forced you to re-evaluate Armitage’s tale about Dunwich. It cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and the people and creatures who attacked here in Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re certain now where you must head: the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\n"
"You consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax. Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy, and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further.\n"
"You pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning, you head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage’s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon Whateley who was present during the events several months ago.\n"
"Armitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and unscrupulous, others “undecayed” or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the closest station and drive you into town\n"
"As the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and exhaustion sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise behind you…"

"博物馆里的怪事，真的和阿米蒂奇说的那个敦威治村没有关系吗？你觉得这应该不是巧合，威尔伯·沃特雷、死灵之书、敦威治的怪物、攻击阿卡姆的神秘团体，这背后肯定有甚么关联。你在心里浮现了一个可以解答你心中疑问的地点：隔离于世的小村——敦威治。\n"
"你本想向马萨诸塞州的警局报告此案，但说出此事弊大于利。而且你经历的事件过于诡异，他们可能只会把这当作是一则荒诞的恶作剧。甚至他们还可能把你关起来。毕竟你曾在一家非法的地下酒吧出现，还侵入了博物馆。于是你不向警局报案，而是自行前往敦威治深入调查。\n"
"你把所有需要的东西都装进了行李，并好好睡了一晚。第二天清早，你就去了北区的火车站，购买了下一班特快列车的票。敦威治并不算太远，火车只需要沿著米斯卡塔尼克河，往西北开几个小时就能到。敦威治没有火车站，你给阿米蒂奇的一个熟人——西布伦·沃特雷打了个电话。西布伦在几个月前被搅入了这个事件中。\n"
"阿米蒂奇的笔记中曾提到，沃特雷家族有许多分支，有些已经衰败且道德沦丧，而其他“未衰败”的分支并未受到邪恶仪式影响。据阿米蒂奇所言，西布伦所属的分支处于衰败与未衰败之间，他清楚家族祖先的传统，但未被其腐化心智。他答应到最近的火车站接你，再将你载回敦威治。\n"
"当火车驶离阿卡姆，你感到前几个夜晚的事件不停地在脑中浮现，这令你万分疲劳。火车突然停了下来。你感到整个车厢都在不停地摇晃，身后传来吵杂的声响……"

msgid "Your experience beyond the gate is simultaneously terrifying and impossible to recall with clarity. A hypnotic spectacle of lights, otherworldly sensations, and altered geometry dances at the tattered edges of your mind. An unearthly voice from beyond rings in your ears, its significance an enigma. When you awaken, you find yourself in the woods, several miles from the Miskatonic River. Destroyed train cars surround you. They are crumpled as if from a severe impact; they are also decayed as if years of rust and squalor have claimed them. There is no sign of the other passengers."
msgstr "裂缝把你们带入了一个完全不同的世界，那里的光景十分可怕，你的记忆被恐惧占领，无法清晰地想起那里到底发生了什么。一道令人昏沉欲睡的光芒骤现，带来超脱尘世的感受，彷佛有无穷变换的图形在你思绪崩坏的边缘舞动。一道神秘的声音在你的耳旁响起，你对这声音的内容毫无头绪。当你醒来时，你发现自己身处米斯卡塔尼克河几英里以外的森林中。支离破碎的火车车厢散落在你周围。车体布满皱纹，看起来经受了严重的冲击；车体还破败不已，其脏污和锈蚀就像经过了数年一般。而其他乘客已不见踪影。"

msgid "You breathe a sigh of relief as the gate behind the train collapses harmlessly upon itself. The few passengers who survived the ordeal seem unable to comprehend what just happened. One passenger mentions “a pipe bursting in the rear car,” and that quickly becomes the explanation for the innocent and ignorant, those who either cannot or choose not to delve further into the mystery. You, on the other hand, know better… although in hindsight, you wish you didn’t."
msgstr "看到车厢后方的巨大裂缝瓦解，你总算松了一口气。从这场惨剧存活的几个乘客似乎无法理解刚才发生了什么。一位乘客提到“后面的车厢有根管子爆炸了”，这个说法很快得到了那些天真无知的人的认可，反正他们也对真相毫不关心。但你却和他们不一样，你知道的比他们更多……尽管经历此事过后，你宁愿自己不曾知道这些事情。"
