"You awaken to the sound of screeching. Fearing the worst, you grab your equipment and head out into the streets of Dunwich. As soon as you step outside, you sense a foulness in the cold night air: an awful, pungent smell that can scarcely be described and a heaviness to the atmosphere that makes it difficult to breathe. The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below.\n"
"Flocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you, watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck. As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature — <b>Yog‐Sothoth</b>. Failing to stop this ritual may spell doom…not only for Dunwich, but for the entire world."

"一阵尖叫声把你惊醒。你心中有种不祥的预感，便立刻下床拿好装备，走出了房屋。敦威治街道的空气异常冰冷，一股刺激性的气味快要让你无法喘息，除此之外，还有一种不可言喻的压抑感。敦威治的村民都把门关得死死的，村庄如同墓地一般。在远处的山顶，一抹微弱的光芒垄罩著村庄上空。阿米蒂奇和西布伦都提到过这个地方，叫做哨兵山。几个月前那场臭名昭著的仪式，就在这里发生。那光如同呼吸一般一明一暗，把夜空照亮至如同白昼。\n"
"夜鹰在村庄的屋顶聚集，注视著你的一举一动。你借用了西布伦那辆老掉牙的货车，向哨兵山进发。尖叫声越来越强烈，令你产生强烈的耳鸣。现在，所有关于敦威治的线索都指向了这个地方。如果赛斯所要举行的邪秽仪式与阿米蒂奇一行人在数月之前所阻止之事有关，那这项仪式就涉及一个古老的存在——<b>犹格·索托斯</b>。如果你无法阻止这场仪式，那么毁灭就将降临在这片大地上，不单单是敦威治，全世界都将成为古神的玩物……"

"The path leading up Sentinel Hill is narrow and too torn up for Zebulon’s truck, so you park at the base of the hill and prepare to make the rest of the trip on foot. Just then, you notice that you are not alone. Several men and women emerge from the woods behind you, brandishing firearms and lining you up in their sights. You raise your hands and brace for the worst. “Wait,” one of them says, raising his hand to the others. “I recognize you from the Clover Club.” He grins toothily and lowers his weapon. “Naomi sends her regards.”\n"
"Curious, you ask what the gangsters are doing here. “Ms. O’Bannion had us investigate the attack on her fiancé’s club,” he explains. “Turns out there were some men in Arkham behind the whole thing. Some Bishop fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before he can explain further, the all-too-familiar ratta‐tat of a tommy gun echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny. Come on, boys!” He beckons to the others to follow and runs up the hill. Shaking your head, you do the same. These mobsters don’t know what they’re getting into."

"山间的小道太过狭窄，西布伦的货车无法开上去。你只好下车徒步上山。没走两步，你发现自己被人跟踪了，一些持枪的黑衣男女正跟在你身后。你转头一看，他们已经举枪瞄准了你，你赶紧举起双手，以免事态恶化。“请等等，”有一个男人向其他人挥手示意。“我们是四叶草俱乐部派来的人。”他浅浅地笑了一下。“娜奥米让我们来向你致意。”\n"
"你好奇地询问黑帮为什么会在这儿。“欧巴尼恩女士命令我们调查她未婚夫俱乐部的袭击事件。”他解释道，“看来这起事件背后是几个阿卡姆的人，是个叫毕晓普的家伙和他的同党。我们追踪他们到此处。”他话还没说完，山上就传来了机关枪扫射的声音。“文尼这家伙，总是这么急性子，大家快跟上！”他指挥其他成员赶紧上山。你无奈地摇了摇头，跟了上去，这些人看来完全不知道自己面对的是什么。"
