"Dr. Armitage suggested you track down his associate Dr. Francis Morgan. He’s not sure whether Dr. Morgan is in trouble, but he’s not particularly happy with his colleague’s present choice of company. He’s in the Clover Club, a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club’s exact location isn’t easy—you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the Downtown restaurants operates as the club’s front. That restaurant is La Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the theatre. You change into your Sunday best and make your way there.\n"
"In front of La Bella Luna stands a man in a pinstripe suit who sizes you up as you approach. “Enjoy yourselves,” he says with a snake-like grin as he holds open the restaurant’s front door."

"阿米蒂奇博士建议你去找摩尔根寻求帮助。他并不知道摩尔根现在的情况，但是他对摩尔根最近的作为很不满意。摩尔根现在正在四叶草俱乐部，那是一个商业街上的地下赌场。要找到这个地方可不容易，你花了一点点小钱，才让几个餐馆服务员乖乖开口。你找到了剧院附近的“月下美人”义大利餐馆，当然这只是个掩饰，更深处藏著的，是铜臭味的秘密。\n"
"在月下美人餐馆门口，一个穿著白色条纹西装的男人，正打量著你。“好好享受吧。”他为你们打开了餐馆的门，脸上浮现出一丝奸诈的笑容。"

msgid "You barely made it out of the club alive."
msgstr "你勉强活著离开了俱乐部。"

msgid "You flee to the end of the block and pause to recover. Before you can catch your breath, the ground shakes with a thunderous crash. People emerge from their homes and storefronts to see what the ruckus is, and a crowd forms on the street. You head to the front of the crowd and are horrified to see the building from which you fled just minutes earlier reduced to rubble. There is no sign of Dr. Morgan anywhere."
msgstr "你飞一样地逃出了餐馆，直到离开这个街区。你停下大口喘著气，突然间，地面轻微晃动起来，人们从家中涌出，来到大街上看到底发生了什么。你推开人群冲到最前面，几分钟前你刚逃出来的月下美人，已经变成了一堆废墟。连同摩尔根博士一起，在这个世界上消失了。"

msgid "“What in the world…?” Dr. Morgan finally breaks out of his daze as you make your way to safety. You ask him what he remembers, and he sputters and shakes his head. “It’s all a haze,” he explains, visibly exhausted. “I was having the run of my life! Perhaps I had one too many shots. But, those creatures—I haven’t seen anything like that since…” He trails off, and you can tell that his mind is racing. His eyes widen with realization and his face pales. “I may not be in the best shape, but I’ll help with your investigation. Whatever it takes.”"
msgstr "“我到底怎么了……”你们在逃跑时，摩尔根博士终于清醒过来。你询问他还记得什么，他迷茫地摇了摇头。“一切都迷迷糊糊的，我那时连赢了好几把，可能一下兴奋就喝多了。但是，这个怪物。我从未见过那样的生物……”他的声音因为疲劳而变轻，你能看得出来，他正在飞速思考著。突然，他瞪大了眼睛，脸色也变得苍白。“我可能现在状况不太好，但我会不惜一切代价协助你们的调查。”"

"Although you were unable to find Dr. Morgan in the club, the man you rescued is grateful for your help. He introduces himself as Peter Clover, the owner of the establishment you’d just left. Despite the situation, he maintains an air of quiet professionalism. As you make your way towards the street, a well-polished Chrysler B-70 rolls up to you, and a gorgeous woman with long brown hair and narrow eyes exits. She is flanked by dangerous-looking men who slip their hands under their suit jackets when they see you. “Peter,” she says with a sigh of relief, “Good, you’re okay. I heard there was trouble?” She turns and glares at you with deadly eyes. “Who are they?”\n"
"Mr. Clover dusts off his vest, unworried. “Naomi, my dear, these are friends of mine. They…” he clears his throat. “They escorted me off the premises,” he explains after a short pause. “They have earned our gratitude.” The woman crosses her arms and takes a moment to size you up before giving you a smirk.\n"
"“Very well then. I must thank you for taking care of Peter. Run along now; we’ll handle things from here.” She nods to the goons flanking her and they walk past you toward the club’s rear entrance, pulling firearms out from underneath their coats. You’re not sure what ‘handling things’ means, but you’re pretty sure you don’t want to be here when the gunfire starts. You thank Naomi and Peter, and head off."

"虽然你无法找到摩尔根博士，但你们救出的那个男人，十分感激你们的友善。他名叫彼得·克劳佛，是四叶草俱乐部所在大楼的主人。尽管发生了这种灾难，他还是保持著专业的冷静头脑。你们向著街道走去，一辆B-70克莱斯勒高级轿车停在你们面前，从里面走出一位留著褐色长发，眼眸细长的美丽女士。她身后跟著一个目光凶恶，身著黑色西服的大汉。“彼得，”那女子看到你们时，好像松了一口气。“你没事真是太好了。我听说你遇到麻烦了？”她转头看了看你们，“这些人是谁？”\n"
"克劳佛拍了拍肩上的灰尘，一脸轻松。“娜奥米，亲爱的，这些是我的朋友。他们……”他清了清喉咙。“他们护送我离开了房子，”他停顿了一下，简短地解释道。“我很感激他们。”那个女人叉起双手放在胸前，仔细地打量著你们，然后是一个很明显的假笑。\n"
"“那好吧。我谢谢你们照顾彼得。你们可以走了，剩下的事交给我们处理。”她向那个壮汉点了点头，然后从后门走进了俱乐部，一边从大衣下拿出了枪。你不太清楚他们会怎么“处理”，不过你也不想知道具体方案。你们谢别了娜奥米和彼得，离开了这儿。"

msgid "You are pulled from the debris by several firefighters, one of whom exclaims, “We’ve got a live one!” A few of them patch you up, and the cops ask you what happened. You’re certain they wouldn’t believe your story about horrible monstrosities demolishing the building from within. Unsure of what to say, you give a vague statement about not remembering much. “We’re bringing you to St. Mary’s,” one of the nurses says, pointing to a nearby ambulance. Knowing now how dire the situation is, you slip away while she is distracted by something else in the rubble…"
msgstr "你被消防员从废墟中拉了出来，“这儿还有人活著！”然后你感到自己被人抱了起来，放在担架上，有警察来盘问你发生了什么。你很清楚，他们不会相信你的故事，那个建筑里的怪物若非亲眼所见，有谁会信呢？你一下感到语塞，憋了半天，勉强讲了一些话作为塘塞。“我们会把你带回圣玛莉医院的，”一名护士把你送上了救护车。你感到事态已经开始变得复杂，于是趁著护士不注意，你偷偷地溜走了……"
