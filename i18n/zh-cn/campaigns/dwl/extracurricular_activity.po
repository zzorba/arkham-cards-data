msgid "As you flee from the university, you hear screaming from the northern end of the campus. An ambulance passes you by, and you fear the worst.

msgid "You find Professor Rice bound and gagged in the closet of his office. When you free him, he informs you that the strange men and women wandering around the campus had been stalking him for hours. They cornered him in his office and tied him up, although for what purpose, Rice isn’t sure. You inform him that Dr. Armitage sent you, and Rice looks relieved, although he suspects that Dr. Morgan might be in danger as well. Because the strangers on campus seem to have been targeting Professor Rice, you decide that the best course of action is to escort him away from the campus as quickly as possible. As you leave the university, you hear screaming from the northern end of the campus. An ambulance passes you by, and you fear the worst. Hours later, you learn that a ‘rabid dog of some sort’ found its way into the university dormitories. The creature attacked the students inside, and many were mauled or killed in the attack."
msgstr "你在办公室的一个衣柜里找到了莱斯教授，他双手被人绑住，口里塞著一团布。你解开了他身上的束缚，他告诉你，在校园中有一群奇怪的人跟踪他几个小时了。他们闯入办公室，把他绑了起来，但是原因却不明确。你告诉他自己是阿米蒂奇博士派来的，莱斯终于松了一口气。不过他觉得摩尔根博士可能也遇到了危险。考虑到绑架莱斯教授的人可能尚未离开校园，你们护送教授尽快离开了这里。你们刚踏出校园的门，就听到从背后传来了人们的尖叫声此起彼伏。救护车从你身边穿过，你心中有种不妙的预感。几小时后，你听说有一条“疯狗一样的生物”闯进了宿舍，不停地攻击学生，有很多人被咬伤甚至死去。"

msgid "You pull each of the dormitory’s fire alarms and usher the students out of the building’s north exit, hoping to make your way off campus. Many of the students are confused and exhausted, but you believe an attempt to explain the situation will do more harm than good. Minutes later, a terrible screech echoes across the campus, piercing and shrill. You tell the students to wait and head back to the dormitories to investigate. Oddly, you find no trace of the strange creature—a prospect that worries you more than it relieves you. You hurry to the faculty offices to find Professor Rice, but there is no sign of him anywhere."
msgstr "你拉动了宿舍的火灾警报器，学生们全都从宿舍撤离了。大部分人都不知道发生了甚么，但是你清楚，不告诉他们应该是最好的做法。几分钟后，校园里响起了恐怖的吼叫声，如此地尖锐而可怕。你告诉学生们不要到处乱跑，然后回到宿舍进行调查。奇怪的是，这里没有任何奇怪的生物，这并未让你感到放松，你反而更为忧虑。你跑回办公室去寻找莱斯教授，但是这里没有任何人。"
