"Six months had passed, and life for Curtis Whateley was finally returning to normal. Since they’d hushed up the incident and the authorities kept their distance from these parts, Mr. Osborn had auctioned off the Ericks and Bishop families’ belongings. Joe took a few trinkets for himself, of course, but Curtis wanted nothing to do with it. Folk already didn’t trust him on account of his family’s sins, even though he’d been attending church on the regular and had stayed far away from anything resembling the arcane.\n"
"Even so, Curtis could not shake a sense of foreboding. He’d seen the devastation that befell the Ericks, Bishop, and Frye homes. He’d even seen firsthand the creature the folks from Arkham had banished. Some days, his thoughts led him to Wilbur Whateley’s farm, where he would stand outside and stare for hours, too scared to enter, but too curious to leave. Maybe there was something in there that could make these terrible visions depart. Something that could give him strength enough to resist the nightmares. Curtis decided he would find it."

"六个月后，柯蒂斯·沃特雷的生活终于回到了原本的轨迹。之前的一段时间，警察和政府调查人员都不停地找他问话。奥斯本先生把埃里克和毕晓普家的遗物都拍卖掉了。乔买下了一些东西，柯蒂斯甚么都没要。村民们已经开始意识到沃特雷这个姓氏，可能和邪恶有所联系。尽管柯蒂斯还是像往常一样，每周去一次教堂，并且表示对魔法毫无兴趣，大家依然渐渐与他疏远了。\n"
"柯蒂斯心中一直很不安，那是一种强烈的预感。毕竟，他见证了埃里克、毕晓普、弗莱三家人的房屋被毁。他亲眼见过阿卡姆的人驱逐的那个怪物。有一天，他路过威尔伯·沃特雷的农场，在那儿驻足良久，呆呆地凝望著。他不敢走进去，但是却因为好奇而不肯离开。假如里面有能让人忘却过去的药水呢？假如里面有能让它充满勇气，去对抗那些恶梦的护符呢？他决定进去察看一番。"

"Gené knelt closer to the ground to examine the sign in the dirt. The shape of the sign was foreign to her, and the tracks that had led to it were unlike any she’d ever seen. Coupled with the report from the university…she wasn’t sure what to think. “Ms. Beauregard,” her assistant called out to her, “have you found something?”\n"
"Gené stood and turned to face the freshman who’d been assigned to her. He was a good kid and a bit callow, but a hard worker and eager to prove himself. “This place was supposed to be cordoned off,” Gené responded. “Nobody’s lived here for months. And yet, see for yourself: their primitive rites continue to this day.”\n"
"The student approached and joined Gené in examining the sign, flipping through the pages of his journal to reference its symbols. “What do you think it means?” he asked. She shook her head. Outsiders rarely traveled to Dunwich, and all the signposts leading to the village had been taken down. But these days, even the townsfolk who had called this place home had abandoned it.\n"
"“I don’t know,” Gené admitted. “But somebody is here, and this isn’t the first sign we’ve seen like this. Stories say there’s an altar where the townsfolk would conduct pagan rituals atop that hill. Maybe we’ll find more up there.”"

"金妮跪在地上，仔细地检查著刻著的那个符号。她从未见过这个符号，这儿那条深深的印痕，也不像是她见过的生物。她快速翻阅了大学提供给她的报告，感到毫无头绪。“博勒加德小姐，”她的助手在叫她的名字，“你发现了什么吗？”\n"
"金妮站了起来，转向那个新来的菜鸟。他是个好学生，可惜太过于不谙世事，急于证明自己的价值。“这个区域已经有好几个月没有人居住了。”金妮回答道，“你看，他们宗教用的仪式场地还留在这儿。”\n"
"那个学生走过来，也蹲下检查地面的印记，然后快速翻找自己的笔记本，想要看看是否有类似的符号。“你觉得这象征著什么？”他问。金妮摇了摇头。以前就不太有人来敦威治，自从指向敦温致的标示牌被撤掉后，连本地人都抛弃了他们的家园。\n"
"“我无法理解，”金妮陷入沉思。“这不是我们第一次看到这个符号了，做这些事的肯定是同一批人。报告里说，这儿曾经有个祭坛，而且这个村的村民，会在那边的山峰上举行宗教仪式。走吧，我们去山上看看，可能会发现什么。”"
