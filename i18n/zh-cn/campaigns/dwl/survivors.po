msgid "Inside the chamber that contained the terrible beast, you find the missing townsfolk and the others from Arkham; they are bound and shackled. You also find several documents that suggest the creature you found isn’t the only one of its kind in Dunwich. You free the creature’s victims from their bonds, and they offer you their thanks. You begin to plan your next move."
msgstr "在关押著怪物的密室深处，你终于找到了敦威治和阿卡姆的失踪者。他们手脚都被绳索捆住，嘴巴也被堵上了。你找到了一份文件，看来塞拉斯还不是敦威治唯一的怪物。你把那些受难者解放了出来，他们十分感谢你。现在，是时候计划下一步行动了。"

msgid "“It is far worse than we had thought,” Dr. Armitage says, pale and trembling. “Wilbur Whateley was only the beginning. There were more, many more in Dunwich, who knew of the ‘Great Old Ones’ and who desired power and knowledge above all else, the Earth be damned. I knew I should have burned that wretch’s journal. But thanks to its contents, I know how we can stop them. We are the only ones who can! Now quickly, help me with this solution—the powder is the key, yes, the powder is the only way…”"
msgstr "“这比我想像的还要糟糕，”阿米蒂奇博士脸色苍白，瑟瑟发抖，连声音都在打颤，“威尔伯·沃特雷只是一切的开始。敦威治还有更多的人知道‘旧日支配者’，他们人数众多，渴望凌驾一切的力量与知识，希望毁灭这个地球。我早就该把那个混蛋的日记给烧掉的。但多亏了他的日记，我也搞清楚了阻止他们的办法。我们是最后的希望了！好了，快点行动起来，我们需要一种独特的粉末，没错，有一种粉末可以帮我们的忙……”"

msgid "Professor Rice adjusts his glasses and studies the documents and arcane manuscripts left in the chamber. “I thought this nightmare was over and done with,” he sighs. “But we have a duty to see this through. We have to stop these creatures, or it won’t be just Dunwich in trouble. The powder mixture Armitage created to see the creatures will be our saving grace,” he explains, and sets off to the task of recreating the powder."
msgstr "莱斯教授擦了擦眼镜，开始查看桌面上剩下来的文件。“我本来以为这段恶梦已经结束了，”他叹息道，“但我们的使命尚未完成。我们必须要阻止这些怪物。否则，有麻烦的就不只是敦威治了。阿米蒂奇创造了一种粉末，能够让无法看见的怪物显形。”他一边解释，一边在桌上调配这种粉末。"

msgstr "沃伦·莱斯教授在敦威治事件中存活。"

msgid "“Thank you for everything you’ve done,” Dr. Morgan says, taking count of your provisions and ammunition. “Last time, we needed some of that strange powder Armitage concocted to even see the beast that terrorized Dunwich. If there’s more of those things out there, we’re going to need that powder. I think I remember how he made it…”"
msgstr "“感谢你所做的一切，”摩尔根博士一边说，一边清点著你们剩余的补给品。“之前，阿米蒂奇曾经提到过一种奇怪的粉末，可以让敦威治的怪物显形。如果事态继续恶化下去，我们就不得不用上那个粉末了。我想我还能记得那个配方……”"

msgid "“Dunwich’s had its fair share of oddities,” Zebulon explains to you with a quavering voice, “but I ain’t ever seen anything as sick and twisted as this…this…<b>thing</b>.” He gives the creature’s remains one last sickened glance before closing the door to the chamber behind him, shuddering. He locks eyes with you, his expression grim. “Whoever dun this gotta pay. I’ll do all I can to help.”"
msgstr "“敦威治的怪事也不是一件两件了，”西布伦想要努力装作平静，但发抖的声音出卖了他，“但是我还从没见过那么恶心、扭曲的……<b>东西</b>。”他最后厌恶地看了一眼那个生物的尸体，颤抖著关上了身后的门。他眼睛凝视著你，表情严峻。“我现在一定要找那个混蛋算帐，放心吧，我会全力帮你的。”"

msgid "“I never could’a made it if it weren’t for you,” Earl says with a stammer, shaking your hand repeatedly. “If ’n there’s anything I can do to repay yeh, just ask away. I ain’t much of a fighter or anythin’, but I’ll do all I can. Jus’…don’t make me look at anythin’ like that beast again, a’right?”"
msgstr "“哎呀，如果不是你，我都不晓得死在哪儿了，”厄尔握著你的手拼命地摇。“你的大恩大德我无以为报，你有啥要求就尽管说。我虽然不太会打架，但是有甚么事情我能帮就帮……就一点，请别让我再看到那种<b>怪物</b>，行不？”"
