"Passing through the gate is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. You feel your body twisting and distorting, churning through realities as the gate pulls you to its ultimate destination—a place beyond the scope of human imagination.\n"
"Suddenly, all is quiet and the chaos of the journey is replaced with a sense of solitude and dread. You are in an unfathomable place, vast beyond your ability to reason and utterly alien besides. The landscape is surreal and strange, the architecture impossible. You are so far from home that home has become a threadbare dream you can barely recall. Even should you find a way out of this awful place, you may never be the same again."

"穿越传送门后，你见到了人生中前所未见的世界。你感到自己的身体不断扭曲，强大的漩涡将你带到了一个遥远的境地，这是远远超越人类想像力极限的空间。\n"
"旅途的疲劳令你感到耳鸣，周围的环境异常安静，令耳鸣声变得更加尖锐。待你缓过神来，你向四周看去，这里的景象超越你的理解范围，甚至不属于任何一颗星球的表面景象。这里的景象超乎现实，诡异至极，建筑外观极其不合理。你离开家乡实在太远，家乡成了你几乎记不起的一个旧梦。即使你能够离开这个鬼地方，你也不再是从前的你了。"

msgid "Where did you come from? Why are you here? Are you dreaming, or is this place real? Now that you think about it, haven’t you been here before? Or perhaps you’ve been here all along. Now you remember. This is your real home. The path you now walk is but one ledge, with many more below. You only have to fall and you will be where you belong. One more step…"
msgstr "你从哪里来？要往哪里去？你是在梦中，还是在现实？你是第一次来到这儿，还是曾经来过？你慢慢思考著，终于想起，这里才是你的家。你往前走著，终于来到台阶的尽头，面前是无穷尽的深渊。现在，只要再往前走一步，你就到家了……"

msgid "Lying on your back in a patch of wet grass, you find yourself staring longingly at the night sky. Somehow, you are once again atop Sentinel Hill, unable to recall exactly how you got here. You are mesmerized by the night sky. Seconds become minutes, and minutes become hours. Eventually, you are found and lifted to your feet by a group of Dunwich citizens. “What happened? What are ya doin’ here?” they ask you, frightened but curious. You can’t seem to find the right words to describe the events that occurred beyond the gate…if they ever truly occurred. There doesn’t appear to be any trace of Seth Bishop, of the creatures you fought earlier, or of the phantasmal and otherworldly gate. But every time you sleep, you dream—and when you dream, it all comes rushing back."
msgstr "你躺在潮湿的草地上，发现自己正呆滞地凝望著夜空的群星。不知道为什么，你又回到了哨兵峰，你已经记不起是如何到达这儿的。你被这夜色迷住了，你看著星空，任凭时间如水般流逝。直到一群敦威治村民走上山头，把你给围住，问道：“怎么回事？你在这儿做甚么呢？”他们的声音里，充满著惊恐和好奇。你想要说点什么，却发现自己词穷了。原来世间一切的词汇，都无法描述那个时空外领域的景色。你想了想，就算告诉他们，应该也不会有人相信。赛斯·毕晓普早已不见踪影，山上的怪物也消失不见，也许他们永远困在了异界之中。每当你入睡，你就会做梦——梦中一切又都回来了。"

"Several of the villagers from Dunwich heard the ruckus on Sentinel Hill and went to investigate. What they found there answered none of their questions.\n"
"“What d’you think happened?” a frightened Curtis Whateley asks as they examine the hilltop. The other villagers shake their heads, unable to say. “Last thing I saw, the sky’d open’d up an’ there was a bright flash,” one of them says, looking up at the starry sky from the top of Sentinel Hill.\n"
"“Those Arkham fellas ain’t nowhere to be seen,” Curtis adds, looking down at the cracked stone altar. “Not even of a hint of ‘em. Mr. Bishop and his pals, now, that’s a diff’rent story.” The young man motions toward several corpses on the ground.\n"
"“Think we should get ahold of those coppers outta Aylesbury?”\n"
"“Why, so they can laugh at us again?” Curtis spits. “They ain’t never gonna believe us ‘bout all this anyway.” He glances at the stone altar, fidgeting nervously. “Better t’ forget about the whole thing. C’mon, let’s bury the dead and get outta here.”"

"哨兵山的喧闹声吸引来了敦威治的村民。但是面前的景象令他们大为不解。\n"
"“你，你们说，这到底是怎么回事呢？”柯蒂斯·沃特雷畏畏缩缩地问道。其他的村民在检查哨兵峰后，都不解地摇著头。“我昨天看到了，天空突然打起雷，还出现一个巨大的洞。”一个村民说道，一边抬头，仰望著哨兵山上的天空。\n"
"“那些阿卡姆来的家伙怎么不见了？”柯蒂斯小心翼翼地查看破碎的祭坛。另一个年轻人指著另一处地面上的尸体，说道：“除了那些尸体，什么东西都没留下，连毕晓普先生都不见了。”\n"
"“要不然，把这些尸体扔到艾斯伯里山好了？”\n"
"“不要不要，不然那些人又要嘲笑我们了。”柯蒂斯反对道。“他们也不会相信我们的，这真是太荒唐了。”他朝祭坛看了一眼，身子还是有点发抖。“我们还是赶紧把这些尸体埋起来，忘了这一切吧。”"

msgid "The creature erupts in a cosmic fury of sound, color, and distorted space, hurling you back and away from it. You watch in horror as one of its arms tears through the fabric of the world, and its amorphous shape funnels through the rift, pulling the threads of the world along with it. You try to cling to something, but you are inexorably sucked into the rift. You feel as if your body is stretching and your mind is being crushed. Then, everything goes black."
msgstr "那怪物愤怒地朝著你咆啸著，顿时，颜色、声音和混乱的时间都一下子具象化，把你震得老远。你惊恐地看著它的手臂撕裂了现世，而其形状不定的身驱像是穿过漏斗一般，从狭缝中挤了出去，连同整个世界一同撼动。你试图抓住什么东西，但你还是被无情地吸入裂缝，感觉整个身体都被撕裂，神智崩溃，终于，你失去了意识。"

msgid "The sorcerers from Dunwich, seeking arcane power from beyond this realm, have accomplished what Wilbur and Old Whateley could not. Through blood sacrifice and indescribable experiments, the dark power the sorcerers sought is now within their reach. However, they will never get the chance to truly wield this power. In beseeching Wilbur’s father for knowledge, they have drawn the creature forth from its extradimensional realm. Yog-Sothoth emerges from the open rift above Sentinel Hill, blotting out the sky and enveloping the world. Now it has come to Earth, and it rules where humanity once tread."
msgstr "敦威治的法师们，穷极一生寻找著异界的魔力源泉，他们完成了威尔伯和老沃特雷没能做到的事情。经过了鲜血献祭和不可名状的实验，法师们掌握了他们所追寻的黑暗力量。但是，他们永远都没有机会去运用这股力量了。他们曾向威尔伯的父亲索要知识，将这个生物从异界招来。犹格·索托斯从哨兵山上空开启的裂缝出现，遮蔽苍穹，垄罩整个世界。现在它已降临到地球，统治人类曾经立足的世界。"
