"When you finally reach Dunwich, you are greeted by Zebulon Whateley and Earl Sawyer, another man from the village who had met with Dr. Armitage during the incident several months ago. “Things ain’t lookin’ too good here,” Earl tells you. “Some folk up and went missin’ a few nights ago. ‘Dem whippoorwills won’ shut up. Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round it was bad news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs and looks away.\n"
"“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes in, putting a wrinkled hand on your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely remember anything else from that night.\n"
"When you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst, you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find answers."

"经过长途跋涉，你终于抵达了敦威治，迎接你的是西布伦·沃特雷和厄尔·索耶。厄尔是阿米蒂奇在几个月前的事件中认识的村民。“这儿最近简直要人命，”厄尔抱怨道，“前几天老是有人失踪，该死的夜鹰叫个不停。我不晓得你来做啥，但你们这些城里人上次来了就没好事。”他眨了眨眼，假装咳嗽了一下，就看向了另一边。\n"
"“兄弟，今晚就好好休息吧，那些破东西明天再找也成。”西布伦打破了尴尬的局面，直接把一只手臂搭在你的肩上。你想要闪躲，但是肌肉疼痛，再加上精神恍惚，也只好忍耐西布伦不合时宜的称兄道弟。那老头建议你今晚睡他家，将你载到郊外，他的家中。这个小村气氛十分古怪，你顿时有点后悔，如果当初不来该多好。你在车上睡著了，几乎忘了那晚发生的所有事。\n"
"当你醒来时，西布伦家空无一人。那个老头已经不在了，就连索耶先生也不在。你有种不好的预感，于是立刻赶往村中心，希望找到一丝线索。"

The creature’s body begins to shrink and melt away as the incantation builds, its cries terrifying and haunting. In the end, all that is left is the disfigured corpse of a man—Silas Bishop. You find a silver pendant emblazoned with an odd constellation tucked into his shirt. You take it with you, hoping to find a use for it."

It appears to be a handwritten excerpt from the Necronomicon, its purpose unknown. With no time to spare, you recite the incantation, stumbling over the words and feeling your throat tighten with each sentence. The creature’s body begins to shrink and melt away as the incantation continues, its cries terrifying and haunting. In the end, all that is left is a pile of wet and sticky ichor, and a rotten stench."
