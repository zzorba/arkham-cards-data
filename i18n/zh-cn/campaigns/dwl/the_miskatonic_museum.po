"Several months ago, Armitage and his colleagues stopped a rampaging horror from tearing through Dunwich, a backwater town several hours north and west of Arkham. At first you imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a different picture.\n"
"It all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human."

"几个月前，阿米蒂奇和他的同事前往了阿卡姆西北方向的敦威治，在那儿阻止了一场惊天大阴谋。一开始，你觉得那个怪物只是熊，或者那一类的东西，但是教授述说的内容却大相迳庭。\n"
"一切都要从一个叫威尔伯·沃特雷的男子说起，他进入奥恩图书馆，查找奥洛斯·沃尔密乌斯翻译的拉丁文版《死灵之书》。威尔伯已经有一本破旧的，约翰·迪伊翻译的英文版《死灵之书》，但他好像并不满足于此。阿米蒂奇拒绝了那个男子，他担心书被恶人利用。不过沃特雷还是悄悄回来了，想要偷走书，却被看门狗咬伤。后来，阿米蒂奇、莱斯和摩尔根找到了沃特雷的尸体，样子十分惨烈。他变得像是野兽和人的混合体，粗糙的皮肤上长满毛发，还长出了灰绿色的触手。你开始怀疑，沃特雷真的是人类吗？"

msgid "The notes written by Dr. Armitage in the journal stress Whateley’s desire to get his hands on the Necronomicon for some terrible purpose. As you read on, it seems that Dr. Armitage brought the university’s copy of the tome to Harold Walsted—the curator of the Miskatonic Museum—for safekeeping in the museum’s Restricted Hall. Although you are worried about your mentor, you are equally worried that Armitage’s kidnappers might get their hands on this Necronomicon. You decide to head to the museum to prevent them from acquiring it."
msgstr "阿米蒂奇的日记里，强调了沃特雷拿取《死灵之书》别有用意。你继续阅读，看到阿米蒂奇博士为了保证书籍的安全，将它交给了大学博物馆的馆长——哈罗德·维尔斯特，让他将书籍放到博物馆的限制区妥善保存。尽管你担心自己导师的安危，但你同样担心绑匪染指《死灵之书》。于是你决定前往博物馆阻止他们。"

msgid "“My colleagues and I were quick to put the ordeal behind us,” Armitage says with a sigh. “But it seems that things haven’t fully resolved themselves. I’ll tell you the rest later, but for now, it is imperative that we get our hands on that copy of the Necronomicon. If my instincts are correct, the assailants you’ve encountered will be searching for it. After all that transpired, I didn’t feel safe keeping it at the library, so I brought it to my good friend, Harold Walsted. He is the current curator of the Miskatonic Museum. I thought it would be safe in the museum’s Restricted Hall, but now I’m not so sure. You must retrieve it at all costs! I fear terribly what they could do with the rites contained in its pages…”"
msgstr "“我们三个很快就忘了此事，”阿米蒂奇叹了一口气，“但看起来事情还未结束。我之后会告诉你们剩下的故事，但现在，《死灵之书》才是最重要的。我有一种预感，那些人不会放弃这本书的。所以我提前将书移出了图书馆，交给了我的好朋友——米斯卡塔尼克大学博物馆馆长，哈罗德·维尔斯特先生保管。我曾以为这本书待在博物馆的限制区足够安全，但现在我不敢如此断言。你必须不惜一切代价取回它！我担心他们会运用书里的仪式来做可怕的事情……”"

msgid "Put one of the two Administration Office locations and one of the two Security Office locations into play at random.

While the Hunting Horror is in the void, it is considered out of play and cannot be affected by player cards or investigator actions."
msgstr "该冒险中，部分卡牌会提及“混沌”区域。混沌是场外区域的一部分，在场景与密谋牌堆旁边，用于放置追猎恐魔。当追猎恐魔在混沌中时，被视为离场，不能被玩家卡牌和调查员行动影响。"

msgid "Whatever the creature in the museum was, you had neither the will nor the tools to destroy it. It seems you must give up any hope of recovering the Necronomicon. Even so, there are others depending on you. Gathering your courage, you prepare for your next task."
msgstr "不管博物馆里的那个东西是什么，你都决定放弃，离开这儿。你知道自己不够勇敢，也没有好的武器，看来《死灵之书》也彻底与你无缘了。不管怎样，还是有人期待著你。何不振作起来，自信地迎接下个任务呢？"

msgid "As long as this translation of the Necronomicon exists, there will be sorcerers and other foul agents like Whateley seeking it. In the end, you know what must be done to protect humanity from the threats you’ve seen. You find a trash bin and fill it with books and documents, throwing the Necronomicon on top. It takes several matches to set the contents of the bin alight. The flames fill the room with heat and the creeping shadows retreat from its light. You watch the book burn for some time, its pages turning to ash. You can only hope you’ve made the right decision."
msgstr "只要这本《死灵之书》还在，就会有更多像沃特雷那样的狂热分子，永无止境地寻找这本书。能够保护人类的方法就是净化这罪恶，唯一能净化罪恶的就是灼热的火焰。你把垃圾桶里填满纸，又把《死灵之书》放在最上面。你划燃几根火柴，点燃了垃圾桶。火焰传来的温暖充斥了整个房间，火光越烧越烈，逼退了墙上的黑影。你看著这本书被烧成灰烬，只希望你所做的决定是正确的。"

msgid "The Necronomicon is more than just a book; it is a tool. Within its pages is a wealth of information about the forces and creatures you have encountered. Knowing how useful it could be in your endeavors, how could you possibly bring yourself to destroy it? Besides, as long as you keep the book safely in your possession, you will still be foiling those who wish to use it for nefarious purposes."
msgstr "《死灵之书》不仅仅是一本书，它还可以受用于你。在这本书中记载著许多与你所遭遇的势力和生物有关的信息。考虑到它对你来说作用斐然，你怎可把它毁了呢？而且，只要你随身带著它，就能防止别人利用它作恶。"
