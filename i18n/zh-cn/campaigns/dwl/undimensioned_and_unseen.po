"Your search of the village of Dunwich has uncovered a number of documents, journal entries, and esoteric theories. Reading through these materials leaves you exhausted and emotionally drained. Most of the content was written by a single source—a man named Seth Bishop. When you ask around town, you learn that Seth is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident. Curiously, since that time, very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed his eyes had been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale.\n"
"You don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would appear nervous or paranoid. But the more you read of his frantic and unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events. His writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence” into other creatures, and eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow are unfathomably complex and defy understanding.\n"
"Before you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and women from the village approach you in a panic. “It’s back!” one of them wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch. “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the Bishops’ home like it were made o’ paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic."

"你在敦威治村展开了调查，找到了大量的文件、日志、论文。等你阅读完这些内容，已经感到疲倦不堪。这些文件的作者基本是同一个人——一个叫赛斯·毕晓普的男人。当你向其他村民打听这个人时，他们告诉你，赛斯的确是本地人。几个月前发生的“敦威治恐怖事件”(这是阿米蒂奇起的名字)，赛斯就是目击者之一。奇怪的是，从那之后，赛斯就很少在村里闲逛，偶而看到他几回，他都是红著眼睛，脸色苍白，满头是汗。\n"
"毫无疑问，赛斯已经有点精神失常了。在你深入研究赛斯那些无比疯狂的文字后，你开始怀疑，他是否参与了这次的事件。他在文件中声称已经“发现了父亲的遗物”，并且使用了奥术的手段，在一些生物体内“灌入了父亲的精华”，最后，他开始把人作为实验对象。文件中虽然有很多图表来解释详细的流程，但你还是很难理解。\n"
"你决定找出赛斯，当面质问他。不过还没来得及行动，就听到村民的叫喊声：“那玩意回来了！那个杀了弗莱一家的东西回来了！它把毕晓普的家像纸片一样撕了个粉碎！”正在慌乱叫喊的是柯蒂斯·沃特雷，他是沃特雷家族中和魔法没甚么关系的人。柯蒂斯和其他的村民乱成了一锅粥，大家呼喊著四处逃避。"

"You aim to calm the townsfolk so they can explain to you what is going on. They inform you that there was a rumbling to the north, and when they went to investigate they found the Bishops’ farmhouse had been torn to shreds. A trail of heavy tracks led into nearby Cold Spring Glen. “You know what to do, right? You Arkham folk stopped that thing last time,” one of the townsfolk says. Curtis shakes his head and bites at his lip.\n"
"“We couldn’t even see that hellish thing until the old professor sprayed that there powder on it,” He says. “To this day,I wish I hadn’t seen it at all…” Something must be done to stop the monster’s rampage. But, if the documents you found are true, there may be more than one such creature on the loose…."

"你试著让村民们冷静下来，好向你解释到底发生了什么。他们告诉你，在村子北边发生了地震，当有人去看时，发现毕晓普的农场几乎被夷为平地。地上有一道深深的痕迹，直接通往冷泉幽谷。“你们知道该怎么办的吧？上次阿卡姆来的人，就成功保护了村子。”有一个村民说道。\n"
"柯蒂斯吓得快哭了，他紧紧咬著嘴唇，不停地摇头。“我们都看不到那个东西，那个怪物只有用教授制作的粉末才会现身，”他说道，“现在我才不想看到那个怪物……”看来有人必须要去阻止那怪物。但是如果你们发现的文件内容是真的话，怪物绝对不只一只……"
