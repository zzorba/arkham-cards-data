"Dr. Henry Armitage pours himself a glass of pinot and sits down at his desk, gesturing for you to sit across from him. “I apologize for the short notice,” he begins. His face is pale, his forehead sweaty and wrinkled with worry.\n"
"Armitage—the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours—privately contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You’d always known Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\n"
"The elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. “I am looking for two of my colleagues—Dr. Francis Morgan, professor of archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A very… <b>familiar</b> feeling.” You’ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. “I tried to find Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n"
"“I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.”"

"亨利·阿米蒂奇博士给自己倒了一杯白葡萄酒，然后坐在他的写字桌前，向你招了招手，示意你坐下。“很抱歉，我这么急著叫你出来。”他说道。你看了看他的脸色，一片苍白，额头上轻微出汗，眉头紧锁著。\n"
"阿米蒂奇是米斯卡塔尼克大学图书馆的负责人，也是你的前任导师。就在刚才，他急匆匆地给你打了一通电话，希望你能去一趟南区他的家中。你一进门，屋中的混乱程度出乎你的意料。他的写字桌上堆满了书和纸片，火炉旁边摆著一个空酒瓶，这可不太像是阿米蒂奇的作风。\n"
"这个老人稍微整理了一下思绪，“我在寻找我的两位同事——佛朗西斯·摩尔根博士，他是考古学教授，以及沃伦·莱斯，一位语言学教授。沃伦本来要与我共进晚餐，一同讨论几项重大发现，但他却意外失踪了。一开始我没有在意，但现在，我有一种不太好的预感，可能事情没有这么简单。我总觉得这样的事情以前也发生过……”阿米蒂奇已无法像往常那样冷静，他拿著酒杯的手微微颤抖。“我试著找佛朗西斯，他或许知道沃伦在哪儿，但我也联系不上他。他就喜欢在赌场里鬼混，别人是这么告诉我的。”\n"
"“我现在很担心沃伦的安危，我现在能指望的人就剩你了。如果你肯帮我找到他，我会很感激你的。当然，如果你能找到佛朗西斯帮忙，就再好不过了。”"
