msgid "“Ah, it’s you. I did not expect you to be here, though perhaps I should have,” Mr. Sanford says with a hint of surprise in his voice. “I regret that you had to be involved in this unfortunate affair. I did not plan for you to be a part of any of this.” You narrow your eyes. You suspect fortune had nothing to do with it. You ask him what will happen to those still trapped inside. “Human progress requires sacrifice,” he recites stoically. “It is lamentable when that sacrifice is in blood, but the price in lamentation does not outweigh the yield of our labor.”"
msgstr "“原来是你啊。我早该想到你会在这儿的。”桑福德略带惊讶地说道，“我很抱歉你被卷入到这场不幸的事件中来。你根本不在我的计划之中。”你瞇起了自己的眼睛。你觉得这不是“不幸”，幸运在这件事上派不上用场。你向他询问，仍被困在里面的人会遭遇些什么。“人类的进步需要有所牺牲。”他坚忍地叙述道，“以鲜血为代价的牺牲固然引人悲悯，但与我们辛劳的成果相比，这种悲悯不值一文。”"

msgid "“I regret that we must meet under such… unfortunate circumstances,” Mr. Sanford says offhandedly. You narrow your eyes. You suspect fortune had nothing to do with it. You ask him what will happen to those still trapped inside. “Human progress requires sacrifice,” he recites stoically. “It is lamentable when that sacrifice is in blood, but the price in lamentation does not outweigh the yield of our labor.”"
msgstr "“我很抱歉我们得在这样……不幸的情况下见面。”桑福德不客气地说道。你瞇起了自己的眼睛。你觉得这不是“不幸”，幸运在这件事上派不上用场。你向他询问，仍被困在里面的人会遭遇些什么。“人类的进步需要有所牺牲。”他坚忍地叙述道，“以鲜血为代价的牺牲固然引人悲悯，但与我们辛劳的成果相比，这种悲悯不值一文。”"

"You didn’t come here to listen to Mr. Sanford proselytize about sacrifice. You came here for answers. You demand an explanation, but the elderly man cuts you off with a scowl. “Yes, yes. You speak of the incident last week. That was the creature’s first manifestation, and the arrival of the dark mist, which you encountered inside.” He glances at the front door to the manor and clears his throat. “The Lodge was not involved in the disappearances that occurred that night,” he explains after a short pause. “But we couldn’t exactly go to the police and tell them a creature made of mist kidnapped four people in Mr. Meiger’s household, could we? So, we had to take matters into our own hands. We suspected that creature was drawn to the crowd, so we recreated the incident in order to understand what happened—to discern its motives.” The decision to host another event at Mr. Meiger’s estate so soon after the disappearances makes sense to you now. As much as you hate to admit it, there is some logic to the plan the Lodge put into action, although you don’t particularly like being used as bait. Who knows how many innocent bystanders were put in mortal danger? Even if the goal was noble, was it worth the sacrifice?\n"
"“I hope you understand that our organization only seeks the betterment of humankind. There are harsh truths that lie beyond our five senses,” Mr. Sanford says, his expression grim. “If we are to survive and prosper, we must adapt. We must learn. We must understand. That is what our order seeks to achieve—a greater understanding of the world around us. A worthy pursuit, don’t you agree?”"

"你不是来这儿听桑福德传教，听他那些关于牺牲的鬼话的。你来这儿为的是答案。你让这位老人解释，但他一脸怒容打断了你。“行行行。你问的是上周的那件事。那是怪物第一次现身，就是你在黑雾里遇到的那只。”他瞥了一眼庄园前门，清清嗓子。他停了片刻，解释道：“那晚发生的失踪事件与秘社无关。但我们不能直接跑到警局去，告诉他们一个雾做的怪物从梅吉尔家绑走了四个人，不是吗？所以，我们得自己解决这事。我们怀疑它被人群所吸引，所以我们将那个事件重现，只为搞明白那晚发生了什么——从而了解那只怪物的目的。”你现在明白了，为什么在失踪事件后会这么快决定再在梅吉尔庄园举办一次活动。尽管你不愿意承认，秘社实施这个计划是有理可循的，但你不太喜欢被人当成诱饵。谁知道有多少无辜的人被置于危险的境地呢？即使目标是崇高的，它值得牺牲吗？\n"
"“我希望你能理解，我们组织只为造福人类。在我们五感之外有一些残酷的存在，”桑福德表情冷峻地说道，“如果我们要生存、要繁荣发展，我们必须适应、研究并理解它们。这就是我们秘社所追求的——更多地了解我们周围的世界。这是一份值得追求的事业，你不这么认为吗？”"

msgid "Before you can reply, one of Sanford’s men emerges from the house behind you. He sheathes a long silver blade as he addresses Mr. Sanford. “There is no sign of Josef inside, sir.” The man eyes you suspiciously, keeping his hand on the hilt of his sword. His posture reminds you of that of a knight, stoic and rigidly disciplined. “I see,” Sanford replies. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before continuing. “A great loss for our order, but one we anticipated. Gather the Lodge’s belongings from inside the estate, and I will deal with the consequences.” The knight nods and heads back inside. Carl’s cold blue eyes turn back toward you. “As for you, I would ask you to leave this place at once. You have done enough harm as it is.” Before you can protest, he commands the other men nearby to escort you off the premises, and you have little choice but to comply."

"你还没回答，桑福德手下的一名男子从你身后的房子走出。他一边把一柄银质长刀入鞘，一边对桑福德说道：“先生，约瑟夫不在里面。”那人手握著剑柄，狐疑地看著你。他的姿势让你想到了坚忍克己、恪守纪律的骑士。\n"
"“我知道了。”桑福德回应。他闭上眼睛，深吸一口气然后继续说道：“这是我社的重大损失，但我们早有预料。把属于秘社的东西都从庄园里取出来，我来承担后果。”那位骑士点点头，返回庄园。卡尔蓝色的眼眸重新望向你：“至于你，我会让你马上离开这里。你造成的伤害已经够多了。”你还没来得及抗议，他命令身边的其他手下护送你离开此地，你别无选择，只得服从。"

"You consider Mr. Sanford’s words carefully. You believe that he is telling the truth, but you’re not sure if the ends justify his means. Before you can reply, Josef steps forward. “I believe our new comrades understand the value of working together,” he says politely, standing at your side. “They could have escaped on their own, but they stayed behind to make sure members of the Lodge were safe. Surely we are of the same mind.”\n"
"“Courage is not the same as sacrifice, Josef,” Carl Sanford intones patiently. “Do they have the will to do what is truly right for all of humanity?” The elderly man turns his attention back to you, his cold eyes glinting in the moonlight. He approaches calmly, extending his hand. “Regardless, you have experienced firsthand the danger that we all face. Join us, and we can face it together. With our knowledge combined, we can protect Arkham from this threat.”"

"你仔细思考桑福德所说的话。你相信他说的是实话，但为了达到目的是否可以不择手段，你不知道。你还没开口回答，约瑟夫迈步向前。“我认为，我们的新同志明白携手合作有多重要。”他站在你身边，恭敬地说道，“他本来可以自己逃走，却留下来确保秘社成员的安全。我们想必是一路人。”\n"
"“有勇气，不意味著敢于牺牲，约瑟夫。”卡尔·桑福德耐心地说道，“他愿意为全人类的福祉做出正确的事吗？”老人将注意力放回到你身上，他冷酷的眼睛在月光下闪烁著光芒。他平静地向你走来，伸出手。“不论如何，你亲身经历了我们所面临的险境。加入我们，一起面对吧。结合我们的知识，我们就能保护阿卡姆不受此次的威胁。”"

"You consider Mr. Sanford’s words carefully. You believe that he is telling the truth, but you’re not sure if the ends justify his means. Before you can reply, Josef Meiger emerges from the house behind you, flanked by two guards wearing expensive suits. One wields a long silver blade as he stands guard. The other observes the situation vigilantly, keeping one hand on the grip of a revolver holstered at his side. Josef recognizes you and addresses you curtly. “You have been poking your head where you don’t belong,” he threatens, narrowing his dark eyes.\n"
"“Stay your tongue, Josef,” Sanford interjects. He approaches calmly, extending his hand toward you. “You have experienced firsthand the danger that we all face. Join us, and we can face it together. With our knowledge combined, we can protect Arkham from this threat.”"

"你仔细思考桑福德所说的话。你相信他说的是实话，但为了达到目的是否可以不择手段，你不知道。你还没回答，约瑟夫·梅吉尔从你身后的房子走出，他左右两侧是两名身著昂贵西装的护卫。其中一名站著护卫时还摆弄著一柄银质长刀。另一名则警惕地观察情势，一只手握紧了身侧的左轮手枪。约瑟夫认出了你，对你简短地说明：“你一直在窥探不属于你的地方，”他瞇起漆黑如墨的双眼对你出言威胁。\n"

I thought you would be insightful enough to see the value in working together. But I realize now that my confidence was misplaced.” He sighs and gazes past you, toward Josef ’s manor. “Very well. The Lodge will handle this problem on our own. Return to your state of ignorance. But I warn you: do not get in our way. I am not an enemy you want to have.” Before you can protest, Sanford commands the other men nearby to escort you off the premises, and you have little choice but to comply."
msgstr "桑福德皱起眉头，将手放回身侧，瞇起了眼睛。“我明白了。说实话，我有些失望。我本以为你有足够的洞察力，明白携手合作有多重要。但现在我意识到，我信错了人。”他叹了口气，视线越过你，望著约瑟夫的庄园，“好得很。秘社会自己解决问题。把这些都忘了，回去过你无知的日子吧。但我警告你：别挡我们的道。你不会想要与我为敌的。”你还没来得及抗议，桑福德命令身边的其他手下护送你离开此地，你别无选择，只得服从。"
