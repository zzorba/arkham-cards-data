"The Unvisited Isle lies in the midst of the Miskatonic River, in between two of the bridges that span the river and connect the Downtown and Rivertown neighborhoods of Arkham. Overgrown with vines, thorns, and unnatural underbrush, the island is home to no residents and very few fauna. Rows of mysterious stone pillars stand sentry throughout the island, rising high above the treetops. Though many theories abound, none know for sure what purpose these stone pillars serve, or who built them. Very few dare to venture onto the shores of the enigmatic island, and those who do return with strange tales: bonfires in the woods at the darkest hours of night—stone altars with deep carvings impossible to translate—empty woods devoid of life, save for the stark-black ravens and whippoorwills who perch on the tree branches and watch trespassers with eager eyes. Unfortunately for you, the stakes are too high for you to heed these many warnings.\n"
"The streets of Arkham are emptier and quieter than you have ever seen them before. A familiar grey mist has enveloped the town. The haze grows denser and thicker the closer you get to the river. You move with haste, not wanting to encounter any others on your way to the site of the ritual, whether they be living or dead. You find several rowboats moored by the docks and climb aboard one of them. With the waters unnaturally still and barely any current carrying the boat, rowing toward the island should be a simple endeavor. Even so, the dense fog makes it difficult for you to get your bearings. Soon, you are completely enclosed by the grey mist, unable to see the banks of the river or the coast of the island. Shapes emerge from the fog. Ripples appear on the surface of the water. The gaze of the watcher is upon you.\n"
"Just then, a pillar of spectral energy ascends into the sky, clear as day even through the haze. The shapes all turn their attention to this beacon, and you sense the watcher’s gaze slipping from your soul. The rite has begun. You row faster, using the light to guide you. It is time to decide once and for all why you have come—are you here to aid the Silver Twilight Lodge? Or to disrupt them?"

"未访之岛坐落在米斯卡塔尼克河中央。两座桥梁横跨河面，将其与阿卡姆的商业区和河岸城连接起来。岛上长满了藤蔓、荆棘和诡异的灌木丛，此地无人居住，动物也稀少。一排排神秘的石柱如哨兵一般伫立在岛上，比树冠还高。尽管众说纷纭，但无一人能够确定这些石柱有何作用，是谁人所建。胆敢登上这座神秘岛屿来探险的人少之又少，其中有人探险归来后讲述了古怪的故事：夜晚至暗时刻树林里燃起篝火——数座石祭坛上深深镌刻著无法翻译的铭文——空荡荡的树林里死气沉沉，只有通体漆黑的乌鸦和夜鹰还栖身在树枝上，用渴望的目光注视著入侵者。不幸的是，要注意到这么多危险的讯号，对你来说已经是件危险的事。\n"
"阿卡姆的街道从未像现在这样空旷、寂静。整座城市被一团熟悉的灰雾所笼罩。你越靠近河边，雾气就变得越发浓重。你匆匆行进，不希望在前往仪式场所的路上遇见任何人，不论是活人还是死人。你发现码头边上停著几艘划艇，便登上了其中一艘。水面呈现出诡异的平静，几乎没有水流推动这艘小艇，看来划到那座岛去不是么难事。即便如此，浓雾让你难以辨清方向。不久，灰雾完全包围你，使你既看不见河的两岸，也看不见岛屿的边界。雾中显现出一些人影。水面泛起了涟漪。看守人正凝视著你。\n"
"就在这时，一道光能直刺天穹，即便在浓雾之中也如同白日一般清晰可见。人影齐刷刷地转向这座灯塔，而你感觉到，看守人的视线离开了你的灵魂。仪式开始了。凭藉光芒的指引，你加快了划艇的速度。是时候最终决定你到这儿来的目的了——你是来这儿帮助银暮秘社的吗？还是说是为了阻止他们？"

"The revenant thrashes and writhes in torment, unable to escape with its connection to the spectral realm torn away. Carl Sanford steps forward, opens a thick leather tome, and the ghost’s memories—along with the remainder of its form—are unceremoniously pulled into its pages.\n"
"“What have you done?!” Anette yells. Several members of her coven surround her. They are embattled, but you have no doubt they would lay down their life to protect their high priestess from harm.\n"
"“What have I done? Why, I have cheated the Devil,” Sanford responds with a sinister grin. You notice the words of his tome are now glowing with a spectral radiance. “Keziah signed the Black Book of Azathoth in order to learn the secrets of the universe. A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\n"

"“我做了什么？多此一问，我欺骗了魔鬼。”桑福德露出邪恶的笑容，回答道。你发现他书上的文字发出了幽灵的光芒。“凯夏为了得到宇宙之秘，在阿撒托斯的黑书签下了姓名。在我看来，这是一个致命的错误，因为她让自己落入了他人掌控之中，而且对方远比她要强大得多。他开始翻读那本书籍，同时继续解释：“她付出了代价，但采摘这果实的人是我。”\n"

The witches retreat into the woods, and you are left alone with your brothers and sisters of the Inner Circle. You gather around your leader, and as he reads from the New Creed of the Silver Twilight Order, he informs you of his plans: of the higher beings of the cosmos, of humanity’s ascension, of the Great Old Ones, of life and death, of Azathoth and the End of Everything.

"Anette is right. Sanford tricked you. This is what he was after all along. Perhaps he considers this “protecting humanity,” but the truth is that he has endangered the lives of others over and over again in order to serve his own greed and lust for power. You shake your head.\n"
"“A pity,” Mr. Sanford complains, “I thought you were smarter than this.” You take several steps back, retreating to where the witches are gathered. Sanford turns to the other members of his Order and points to you. “Kill them,” he commands.\n"
"“Erynn, give us cover!” Anette barks to the red-haired witch next to her. The witch nods in response and waves a wooden rod in front of her, creating a cloud of mist that masks your presence. “We have to get out of here. Go!” Anette yells.\n"
"Your escape is a blur. Robed members of the Silver Twilight cult chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. You motion for Anette and the others to join you, but she shakes her head. “We’ll meet again soon.” The edges of the witches’ cloaks bleed into the night sky, and with a swirl of darkness, they vanish one by one."

"“伊琳，掩护我们！”安妮特对她身旁的红发女巫吼道。那女巫点点头，在身前挥舞著一根木杖，变出一团浓雾掩藏你们的行踪。“我们得离开这儿。走吧！”安妮特喊道。\n"
"你在浓雾的掩护下逃走了。身著长袍的银暮秘社成员奔跑在荒凉的树林里，无情地追赶著你。你勉强跑到岸边，险些就要被他们追上。你向安妮特和其他女巫示意，让她们跟你一道走，但她摇摇头。“我们很快还会再见面的。”女巫们的斗篷没入夜空，一个接一个消失在漆黑的漩涡中。"

"Anette approaches, confronting the remnant’s ethereal shell. “Sister! We are the ones who have called you here from the great beyond.” The shattered revenant turns its attention to Anette, and the rest of her coven watch in anticipation.\n"
"“What are you doing, you fool? This spirit is no mere witch!” Carl Sanford yells out. But it is too late. Anette ignores Mr. Sanford, continuing to speak with the spectral presence. “For years we have suffered injustice after injustice. Share with me your secrets, sister. Together, as one mind, body, and soul, we can begin anew.”\n"
"The ghost reaches out to her with a long, skeletal arm. Anette’s sisters gasp as their high priestess steps forward and kneels before the being, offering herself. With a sudden rush of energy, the phantom soul is drawn inside Anette. She collapses to the ground, reeling from the spiritual impact. Her body writhes in torment, but none of the other witches step forward to help, instead watching with equal parts terror and fascination. Finally, Anette rises to her feet, her eyes aglow with mystical power. When she speaks, it is not her voice. “Sisters. Rejoice, for I am reborn,” Keziah says.\n"
"Carl Sanford taps you with his cane. You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn’t noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge’s inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. “We must leave this place at once,” Sanford says stoically. “This being possesses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.”\n"
"Anette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. “You look familiar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.” She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul. You hate to admit it, but Sanford is right. You turn and flee with the rest of the Lodge, hoping you are fast enough to escape the witch’s magic. \n"
"Your escape is a blur. Witches and spirits chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. Other members of the Lodge are perhaps not so fortunate. Having scattered in many directions, you’re not sure how many of them escaped, and you don’t see Carl Sanford anywhere, though you suspect he had a plan for this outcome."

"“你在干什么？你这蠢货！这个鬼魂已经不止是女巫了！”卡尔·桑福德大声吼道。但已经太晚了。安妮特不顾桑福德的叫喊，继续对那鬼魂说：“这些年来我们遭受了一次又一次的不公。把你的秘密分享给我吧，姐姐。来吧，让我们合二为一，精神、肉体、灵魂都融于一体，重新开始。\n"
"那幽灵对她伸出一根瘦长的枯骨手臂。安妮特的姐妹们呼吸急促，看著自己的女祭司步上前去，跪在鬼魂面前，献出自己的肉体。一股力量突然涌出，那鬼魂被安妮特吸入体内。她精神受到冲击，一阵眩晕倒在地上。她身体痛苦地扭动著，但其他女巫没有一人上前施救，而是全都看著她，面带恐惧与陶醉。最后，安妮特站起身来，眼睛闪耀著神秘力量的光芒。她说话时已不是她原来的嗓音。“姐妹们。庆祝我的重生吧。”凯夏说道。\n"
"卡尔·桑福德用手杖轻轻碰你。你被眼前发生的事情惊呆了，全然没有注意到秘社的成员正悄悄离开这片空地。一名秘社核心圈成员举起左轮手枪，想要开枪，但女祭司只注视著他，他的手臂便在你眼前萎缩、腐烂。他手枪咔嗒掉落在地，发出最后一声嚎叫，最后他归于虚无，只在地上剩下一个腐烂的躯壳。“我们必须马上离开这里。”桑福德坚定地说，“那鬼魂掌握著高于生死本身的力量。我们再也没法伤她分毫。\n"
"安妮特——不，是凯夏——转向你，双眼闪耀著光芒。“你看起来很熟悉，孩子。来吧，过来。别害怕。你不需要害怕我。”她居心叵测地狞笑著，声音像是尖刀一般刺进你的灵魂。你不想承认，但桑福德说得对。你转身和秘社成员们一起逃跑，只盼自己能跑快些，从那女巫的魔力之下逃脱。\n"
"你在浓雾的掩护下逃走了。女巫和幽灵在荒凉的树林里无情地追赶著你。你勉强跑到岸边，险些就要被他们追上。其他的秘社成员或许就没这么幸运了。你和他们分头逃跑，不确定他们有多少人逃出去了，而你到处都看不见卡尔·桑福德的踪影，但你猜测他对现在的局势早有对策。"

"When you come to your senses, the wind has subsided and the dark mist has vanished. With the ritual concluded, the island seems to have returned to normal—but was the ritual successful, or did it fail? You make your way to the center of the island to find out what happened. As you arrive, you find Anette and her coven heavily wounded, and the Lodge stands victorious. Carl Sanford holds a thick leather tome in his hands, its pages glowing with arcane power. “What have you done?!” Anette yells. Several members of her coven surround her. They are embattled, but you have no doubt they would lay down their life to protect their high priestess from harm.\n"
"“What have I done? Why, I have cheated the Devil,” Sanford responds with a sinister grin. You notice the words of his tome are now glowing with a spectral radiance. “Keziah signed the Black Book of Azathoth in order to learn the secrets of the universe. A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\n"
"Anette clenches her jaw and turns toward you. “Listen to me. You cannot even begin to fathom the secrets this monster now possesses. You must stop him, no matter the cost.”\n"
"You hold your tongue, but in the back of your mind, you suspect Anette is right. Sanford has tricked you. This is what he was after all along. Perhaps he considers this “protecting humanity,” but the truth is that he has endangered the lives of others over and over again in order to serve his own greed and lust for power. However, before you can confront Sanford, he turns to the other members of his Order and points to you. “This one is no longer useful,” he explains. “Kill them all.”\n"
"“Erynn, give us cover!” Anette barks to the red-haired witch next to her. The witch nods in response and waves a wooden rod in front of her, creating a cloud of mist that masks your presence. “We have to get out of here. Go!” Anette yells.\n"
"Your escape is a blur. Robed members of the Silver Twilight cult chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. You motion for Anette and the others to join you, but she shakes her head. “We’ll meet again soon.” The edges of the witches’ cloaks bleed into the night sky, and with a swirl of darkness, they vanish one by one."

"当你意识回复，风已停息，黑雾也已经消失。仪式完成后，整座岛似乎已经恢复正常——但仪式是成功了，还是失败了呢？你走向岛屿中央，看看发生了什么事情。到达后，你发现安妮特和女巫集会的其他人身负重伤，这一役是秘社赢了。卡尔·桑福德手里捧著一本厚厚的皮质书籍，书页正发出神秘的光芒。“你都做了什么？！“安妮特喊道。几名女巫集会的成员围在她身侧。她们严阵以待，无疑不惜牺牲性命也要保护自己的高阶女祭司。\n"
"“我做了什么？多此一问，我欺骗了魔鬼。”桑福德露出邪恶的笑容，回答道。你发现他书上的文字发出了幽灵的光芒。“凯夏为了得到宇宙之秘，在阿撒托斯的黑书签下了姓名。在我看来，这是一个致命的错误，因为她让自己落入了他人掌控之中，而且对方远比她要强大得多。他开始翻读那本书籍，同时继续解释：“她付出了代价，但采摘这果实的人是我。”\n"
"安妮特朝你转过身来，咬紧牙关。“听我说。你根本不懂那鬼魂掌握了怎样的秘密。你得阻止他，不惜任何代价。”\n"
"你沉默不语，但在你心底里，你觉得安妮特说的是对的。桑福德骗了你。一直以来他都在欺骗你。或许他认为这是在“保护人类”，但实际上他贪求权力，一次又一次将他人置于危险的境地。但你还没有机会面对桑福德，他便指著你，转身对修道会的其他成员命令道：“这个人已经没用了。”他说道，“把他们全都杀了。”\n"
"“伊琳，掩护我们！”安妮特对她身旁的红发女巫吼道。那女巫点点头，在身前挥舞著一根木杖，变出一团浓雾掩藏你们的行踪。“我们得离开这儿。走吧！”安妮特喊道。\n"
"你在浓雾的掩护下逃走了。身著长袍的银暮秘社成员奔跑在荒凉的树林里，无情地追赶著你。你勉强跑到岸边，险些就要被他们追上。你向安妮特和其他女巫示意，让她们跟你一道走，但她摇摇头。“我们很快还会再见面的。”女巫们的斗篷没入夜空，一个接一个消失在漆黑的漩涡中。"

As you arrive, you find Carl Sanford and the other members of his Order heavily wounded, and Anette and her coven stand victorious. Anette stands at the center of the clearing, her eyes aglow with mystical power. When she speaks, it is not her voice. “Sisters. Rejoice, for I am reborn,” Keziah says.\n"
"Carl Sanford taps you with his cane. You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn’t noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge’s inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. “We must leave this place at once,” Sanford says stoically. “This being possesses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.”\n"
"Anette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. “You look familiar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.” She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul. You hate to admit it, but Sanford is right. You turn and flee with the rest of the Lodge, hoping you are fast enough to escape the witch’s magic.\n"
"Your escape is a blur. Witches and spirits chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. Other members of the Lodge are perhaps not so fortunate. Having scattered in many directions, you’re not sure how many of them escaped, and you don’t see Carl Sanford anywhere, though you suspect he had a plan for this outcome."
