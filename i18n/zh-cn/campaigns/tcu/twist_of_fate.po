"You stand underneath the breach, in awe of its presence. Everything the soothsayer predicted has come to pass. “This is a matter of life and death,” she had told you. How right she was. Beyond the cosmic ingress, the nucleus of the cosmos awaits. Now you understand what dwells on the other side, gnawing hungrily at the fabric of reality: the doom of all humanity; no, not just humanity. The doom of all life in the universe.\n"
"There is a bitter taste in your mouth. Tears well in your eyes. You close your fist so hard your nails dig into your flesh. If you have to die, then die you will. But you’re not going to die sitting down."

"你站在裂口下方，对其存在感到敬畏。占卜师所有的预言都应验了。“这关系生死。”她当时是这么跟你说的。她说的太对了。迈进宇宙的入口，等待著你的是宇宙的核心。现在你知道了潜伏在另一头的是什么，它饥饿地啃食著现实世界：它是全人类的末日；不，不仅是人类的末日。宇宙中所有生命的末日。\n"
"你口中泛苦，泪盈眼眶。你握紧拳头，指甲深深扎进肉里。如果你必将死去，那你不会贪生。但你不会坐以待毙。"

msgid "“Keziah was beseeched to sign a book by the messenger of an ancient being. The Black Book of Azathoth.” Just the name of the thing shakes you to your core. Anette clenches her fist. “I was a fool to not have understood before. That was the source of her power. Not witchcraft, but a pact with a terrible, dark god. All of this, these incursions into our world, the broken bonds of death: it is what Keziah wanted all along. It was the silent will of Azathoth,” she says resentfully."
msgstr "“一位远古的存在留下了信息，恳求凯夏在一本书上签名。阿撒托斯的黑书。”光是它的名字，就让你心灵为之震颤。安妮特握紧拳头，“我真是个笨蛋，没有早些明白。她力量的来源不是巫术，而是与可怕的邪神缔结的契约。我们家园遭受的入侵，与亡者之间破裂的纽带：这一切都是凯夏一直以来想要的，也是阿撒托斯的无声旨意。”她愤恨地说道。"

msgid "“It is a gateway,” Sanford explains, “ joining our world and the greater Cosmos. According to some of the most heinous tomes I have read, at the center, there sleeps a creature known as Azathoth.” Just the name of the thing shakes you to your core. “I fear we have stirred it in its slumber. All of this, these breaches in space, these broken barriers between worlds: it is all because for just a brief moment, for one fragment of a second, we interrupted Azathoth’s dreaming. Do you understand?”"
msgstr "“这是一个入口。”桑福德解释说，“连接著我们的世界和更宏大的宇宙。我曾读过一些最为邪恶的书籍，书中记载著，在更为宏大的宇宙中心，沉睡著一个名叫‘阿撒托斯’的存在。”光是它的名字，就让你心灵为之震颤。“我怕我们已把它从睡眠中唤醒。所有这一切，空间的裂口，异界之间的破碎：这一切都是因为那一刹那，那破碎的一秒钟，我们惊动了睡梦中的阿撒托斯。你听明白了吗？”"

msgid "For almost an hour, you stare up into the empty abyss, pondering your options and your fate. A flock of faceless winged creatures circle the field where you sit. They almost move like vultures, waiting for your demise so as to feast on your corpse. They draw ever nearer, and you begin to wonder if they can read the thoughts that hover on the surface of your mind. Rising to your feet, you raise your arm and call out to one of them. This may be the most foolish thing you have ever done, you think to yourself. But your instinct proves to be the right move: the creatures descend on black leathery wings, landing on the wet grass in front of you. One lowers itself until it reaches the height of your shoulders, offering its back to you. Swallowing the very last of your doubts and your fear, you climb aboard the creature. With a swift flap of its wings, it carries you off into the void, beyond the limits of space…to the domain of Azathoth."
msgstr "在接近一个小时的时间里，你凝视著这空虚的深渊，思考著自己的选择与命运。一群长有翅膀的无脸生物在你坐的地方周围环成一圈。它们移动的样子简直像是秃鹫，等待著你的死亡，好享用你的尸体。它们离你越来越近，你开始怀疑它们是不是听见了你心头的思虑。你站起身高举手臂，大声呼唤其中一头生物。这可能是你做过的最蠢的事情，你心下暗想。但事实证明，你的直觉是正确的：这些生物扇著黑色的皮革翅膀降落在你面前湿漉漉的草坪上。其中一头生物放低身体，刚好到你肩膀的高度，将自己的后背交给你。你放下心头所有的怀疑与恐惧，爬到它身上。它迅速扇动翅膀，带著你飞入虚空，超越空间的界限……进入阿撒托斯的领域。"
