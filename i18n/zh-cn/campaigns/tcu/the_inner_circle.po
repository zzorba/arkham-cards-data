"You have been brought deep into the inner sanctum, where only the highest-ranking members of the Lodge are allowed. Mr. Sanford explains that the Order of the Silver Twilight is far older and more important than the public-facing Silver Twilight Lodge, and that their knowledge extends into the realm of the arcane and the obscure. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and we are the only ones who can stop it. You know the creature I speak of.” You nod in affirmation.\n"
"“Here is what we know: it was the witches who brought this abomination upon Arkham. We tried to stop their ritual, but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in binding it. Now it is loose, and we must finish what we started before the witches are able to do the same. But first, I understand you may have some information for us, as well. Please, hand over what you have found. It is important that we collaborate in order to understand this situation.”"

"他领你来到深处的圣堂内室，只有最高阶的秘社成员才允许进入此处。桑福德解释说，银暮修道会比面向公众的银暮秘社更为古老、地位更为重要，所掌握的知识涉及到神秘而晦涩的领域。“银暮修道会在过去的几十年里，苦心追寻能够造福全人类的知识。我们曾击退外敌，捍卫组织存亡。我们为这神圣的目标牺牲一切。而今，又有外敌侵扰我们的城市，只有我们能够阻止它。你知道我所说的就是那头怪物。”你点头同意。\n"
"“我们知道，将这可憎的怪物带来阿卡姆的就是那群女巫。我们试过阻止她们的仪式，但很遗感咒缚没有成功。现在术式不稳定，我们必须赶在女巫完成仪式之前将它封印。在开始之前，我知道你也有一些信息要提供。来吧，把你发现的东西说出来。我们互相合作，才能弄明白现在的情况。”"

msgid "Give Mr. Sanford everything you have found."
msgstr "将你找到的所有东西交给桑福德。"

msgid "Tell him you have nothing to show. (You are lying.)"
msgstr "告诉他你什么都没找到。(你在撒谎。)"

msgid "You show Mr. Sanford the evidence you’ve collected. “Hm… Yes, I see. It is as I suspected,” he murmurs as he inspects the trinkets."
msgstr "你将自己收集到的证据交给了桑福德。“唔……嗯，我明白了。正如我所料。”他一边检视著这些小玩意儿，一边喃喃细语。"

msgid "Cross off each memento listed under “Mementos Discovered” in your Campaign Log."
msgstr "在冒险日志“遗留记忆”下方划掉所有条目。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. <i>If the investigators rescued Josef</i> and <i>the investigators told the Lodge about the coven</i>."
msgstr "查看冒险日志。如果记录有<i>调查员救出约瑟夫</i>和<i>调查员将女巫集会的事情告诉秘社</i>。"

"You don’t trust Carl Sanford with these pieces of evidence. Who knows what he intends to do with them? In the hands of the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge, any one of these items could be a deadly instrument. You lie, informing him that your investigation has so far proven fruitless. He clenches his jaw and glares at you for a moment, his cold blue eyes staring daggers into yours. “That is disappointing to hear. But perhaps it is my fault; I should not have imposed such a heavy burden on a neophyte to the Order.”\n"
"Mr. Sanford rises to his feet, and the other members of the Order follow suit. He addresses the other members of the Inner Circle: “All right. We have no more time to spare. The ritual must be completed at once. We shall use the same site as before—the central pillar of the Unvisited Isle, where the barrier between this world and the next is thinnest. It is likely that the anomaly will pursue us there, so act with caution.” Then he turns back to you. “We will require your assistance as well, of course. The device you hold is the key to binding the revenant. You must use it properly when the time comes. Do you understand?” You nod in affirmation. Taking a deep breath to steel your nerves, you prepare for the journey to the Unvisited Isle—a journey toward death itself."

"你不放心将这些证据交给卡尔·桑福德。谁知道他想用这些东西做些什么？这些东西里，不管是哪一个落到了银暮秘社会长的手里，都能成为致命的杀著。于是你谎称至今为止什么都没查到。他下颌紧绷，冷酷的蓝眼睛像刀子一般直直盯著你的双眼。“那可真遗憾。但这可能是我的错；我不应该将这样的重任强加在修道会的新人身上。”\n"
"桑福德站起身来，其他修道会成员也跟著他站起。他对核心圈的其他成员说道：“好吧。我们时间所剩无多。必须马上完成仪式。仪式场所照旧选在未访之岛的中央石柱——现世与异界之间隔阂最薄弱的地方。异象可能还会纠缠著我们，所以要谨慎行事。”随后他转向你，“当然，我们还需要你的帮助。你手中的箱子正是咒缚亡灵的关键。时机到来的时候，你得正确地使用它。听明白了吗？”你点头同意。深吸一口气来平息紧张的情绪，你准备踏上前往未访之岛之旅——一趟死亡之旅。"

msgid "the investigators kept their mementos hidden."
msgstr "调查员隐瞒了自己发现的遗留记忆。"

msgid "Carl Sanford grins and rises to his feet. “You have proven yourself a loyal asset to our Order. I believe it is time that you ascended to our Inner Circle.” You approach and kneel before Mr. Sanford. He spreads his arms wide and declares, “I hereby appoint to you the rank of Knight of the Inner Circle. Arise once more, knight, and stand tall. You are now one of the elite guardians of humanity, keepers of the truth, and stewards of the Silver Twilight Order.” Another member of the Order offers you a folded blue robe, and you don it solemnly. “Now, I am sure you have many questions for me. We do not have a lot of time to dawdle, but you deserve answers. What do you wish to know?”"
msgstr "卡尔·桑福德笑著站了起来：“你证明了自己是修道会忠诚的一份子。现在是时候让你晋升，加入我们的核心圈了。”你步近桑福德，在他面前跪下。他大展双臂，宣告：“我在此任命你为核心圈的一员，授骑士爵位。站起来吧，骑士，站直。你现在是人类的精锐守卫者、真理保守者、银暮秘社修道会的管理者。另一名修道会成员递来一件叠好的蓝色长袍，你庄严地将它穿上。“现在，我知道你有很多问题要问我。虽然我们没时间闲聊，但这是你应得的，我会回答你。你想知道些什么？”"

msgid "You may ask up to three questions of Carl Sanford before his patience wears thin."
msgstr "在卡尔·桑福德的耐心耗尽之前，你最多可以问他3个问题。"

msgid "Choose a question to ask Carl Sanford."
msgstr "选择一个问题来询问卡尔·桑福德。"

msgid "<i>“What is the creature?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“那头怪物是什么？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“What do you want with the creature?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“你打算对那头怪物做什么？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“What do the witches want with the creature?”</i>"

msgid "<i>“Did you know about the creature before the charity gala?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“你在慈善晚宴之前就知道那头怪物的存在吗？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“Where are the four missing people from the charity gala?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“慈善晚宴上失踪的四个人现在身在何处？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“…Why are you looking at me like that?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“……你为什么这样看著我？”</i>"

msgid "You may only ask this question because <i>the investigators survived the watcher's embrace</i>."
msgstr "因为<i>调查员从看守人之拥下存活</i>，你只能提问这个问题。"

msgid "Finished asking questions."
msgstr "结束提问。"

msgid "“It is a powerful remnant, left behind from one who perished long ago. The witches could only have summoned it if they had a strong connection to the soul it once belonged to,” Mr. Sanford explains. “It could only be one person: Keziah Mason herself.”"
msgstr "“那是很久以前死去的人留下的，强大的鬼魂。女巫之所以能够召唤它，是因为她们与那鬼魂的肉身有著紧密的联系。”桑福德解释道，“它肯定是那个人的鬼魂：凯夏·梅森。”"

msgid "“First and foremost, we need to bind it to prevent it from doing further harm. That is of paramount importance. Once it is bound, we may be able to learn the secrets it possesses without endangering ourselves or others.”"
msgstr "“首先，我们得对其施术绑缚，阻止它继续作恶。这是至关重要的。封印完成后，我们就能够在保全自身和他人的前提下学习它所拥有的知识。”"

msgid "“I am sure they wish to learn its secrets, and draw from its power,” he theorizes, stroking his beard. “Perhaps allow one of their own to become possessed by the spirit, and hence gain power over life and death itself.”"
msgstr "“我很肯定，她们想要知道它的秘密，抽取它的力量。”他捋著胡须，推断道，“可能会让那鬼魂附在其中一个女巫的身上，从而获得超越生死的力量。”"

msgid "“In truth, yes,” Mr. Sanford admits. “But we did not know it would come to us. After interceding in the witch’s summoning rite, we investigated the spectral mist that was left behind for several days. We likely drew too much attention to ourselves, and it was drawn to our presence. Not necessarily a bad thing, in the end.”"
msgstr "“老实说，是的。”桑福德承认，“但我们没想到它是冲著我们来的。插手女巫的召唤仪式后，便有鬼灵迷雾数日不散，我们遂展开调查。我们可能太过张扬，被它盯上了。但说到底，这不一定就是件坏事。”"

msgid "“God only knows,” Mr. Sanford replies with a sigh. “Taken by the revenant, perhaps. Or swallowed by the mist.” He considers this for a while, then adds, “I suspect that if they are still alive, they cannot be far from the revenant. For better or for worse, the anomaly seems localized around it."
msgstr "“这事只有上帝知道答案了。”桑福德叹了口气答道，“或许，他们被归来的亡灵带走了。或者是被迷雾吞噬了。”他想了一会，补充道，“我猜，要是他们还活著，那他们也快变成亡灵了。异象似乎只发生在它周围，说不清是好事还是坏事。”"

msgid "Mr. Sanford clears his throat. “I… It is nothing,” he lies."
msgstr "桑福德清了清嗓子“我……没什么”。他在撒谎。"

"Carl Sanford gives the trinkets and strange components to another member of the Inner Circle, who retrieves them with care and brings them upstairs. “Thank you for your assistance in this matter. We are stronger together than apart; don’t you agree?”\n"
