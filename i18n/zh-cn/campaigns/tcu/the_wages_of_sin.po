"Ever since your encounter with the ghost in the Witch House, you have been forced to reconsider everything you know about life and death. Keziah Mason died over two hundred years ago, but her spirit remains in the spectral mist—the same mist you encountered in Josef Meiger’s manor. One question lingers in your mind as you consider the events that have transpired: Does Keziah’s spirit linger because of the mist, or is the mist caused by her presence? Which is the disease, and which the symptom?\n"
"The more you delve into Arkham’s history of witchcraft and persecution, the more restless you become. Night after night, you are assaulted by terrible dreams—dreams of death and decay, of guilt and sin. There is an evil that dwells in this city, an evil that has long remained hidden in the darkness of Arkham’s past. What’s worse, your inquiry has reached an impasse. You believe that if you can find the coven of witches you saw in the woods that fateful night, you might be able to learn more about Keziah Mason or of this unspoken evil.\n"
"As you go through your morning routine, your eyes drift across one of the smaller headlines of today’s newspaper: “Ghost Sightings on Hangman’s Hill? Residents of Uptown claim to have seen human shapes in the thick fog emanating from Hangman’s Brook…” It couldn’t be a coincidence, could it?\n"
"Then the realization dawns on you—if it is witches you seek, the only place you can be certain to find them is six feet underground, in the place where professed witches were executed all those years ago. Searching for specters in a graveyard may not be your safest bet, but you’re not sure one can stay safe in this city anymore."

"自从在巫宅遇鬼，你不得不重新思考你对生与死的一切认知。凯夏·梅森死了超过两百年，但她的灵魂留在了鬼灵迷雾之中——也就是你在约瑟夫·梅吉尔庄园遇到的那团雾。当你细想发生的一系列事件，一个问题萦绕在你的脑海里：凯夏的灵魂是因为那团迷雾才徘徊不散，抑或是她的存在导致了迷雾产生？究竟哪一个是因，哪一个是果？\n"
"你越是深入研究阿卡姆的巫术和迫害历史，越是焦躁不安。你每夜每夜被恐怖的梦所袭击——梦里尽是死亡和衰败，愧疚和罪恶。这座城市里潜伏著一股邪恶，一直隐藏在阿卡姆的黑暗往昔之中。更糟糕的是，你的调查陷入了僵局。你认为，要是你能找到那晚你在树林里看见的女巫集会，你或许就能够更加地了解凯夏·梅森，或者这难以言喻的邪恶。\n"
"在进行早上的日常工作时，你的眼睛扫到今天报纸上的一个小标题：“在绞刑者山丘目睹幽灵？上城区居民声称在绞刑者河边散发的浓雾中看见了若干个人影……”这不可能只是个巧合，对吧？\n"
"这时你才恍然大悟——如果那就是你要找的女巫，那你唯一确认能够找到她们的地方就在地下六英呎，传闻中多年以前处决女巫的地方。在墓地里找幽灵或许不是最安全的法子，但你不确定继续呆在城里是否安全。"

"During the setup of this scenario, two encounter decks are constructed: a “standard” encounter deck and a “spectral” encounter deck. Generally speaking, whenever an investigator would interact with the encounter deck, that investigator should use the standard encounter deck.\n"
"However, at a certain point during this scenario, locations may flip over to their [[Spectral]] side. While an investigator is at a location with the [[Spectral]] trait, that investigator should use the spectral encounter deck instead of the standard encounter deck for all purposes, unless otherwise noted. This includes drawing cards from the encounter deck, as well as searching, looking at, revealing, or otherwise interacting with the encounter deck (or encounter discard pile) in any way. This also includes abilities that trigger when the encounter deck runs out of cards. If an effect specifically refers to the standard encounter deck or spectral encounter deck, it interacts with the specified deck regardless of the investigator’s location.\n"
"Each of the two encounter decks have their own discard pile. Whenever a card with the [[Spectral]] trait would be discarded, it is placed in the discard pile for the spectral encounter deck. All other encounter cards are discarded to the discard pile for the standard encounter deck.\n"
"<i>Note: Flipping a location over from one side to another during this scenario does not “reveal” the new location.</i>"

"在本场冒险的设置阶段，构筑2个遭遇牌堆：1个“基础”遭遇牌堆，1个“幽灵”遭遇牌堆。一般来说，调查员将要与遭遇牌堆互动时，该调查员应该使用基础遭遇牌堆。\n"
"但是，在本场冒险的一个特定时间点，地点卡可能翻面至[[幽灵]]面。调查员位于带有[[幽灵]]属性的地点时，该调查员在任何情况下都不使用基础遭遇牌堆，改为使用幽灵遭遇牌堆，除非有特殊说明。包括从遭遇牌堆抽取卡牌、查找、查看、翻开或其他任何形式与遭遇牌堆(或遭遇弃牌堆)的互动，都使用对应的遭遇牌堆。遭遇牌堆用完时触发的能力也正常触发。如果一个效果特别指明是基础遭遇牌堆或幽灵遭遇牌堆，该效果与对应的牌堆互动，不论调查员位于什么地点。\n"
"上述两个遭遇牌堆分别拥有各自的弃牌堆。带有[[幽灵]]属性的卡牌将被弃掉时，将其放在幽灵遭遇牌堆的弃牌堆。其他所有遭遇卡被弃掉时放入基础遭遇牌堆的弃牌堆。\n"

You hope that you have done enough to prevent the rest of Arkham to succumbing to this horror."

"Resigned to your fate, you fall to your knees. The mist parts. Time slows to a crawl as the watcher emerges. Its spectral form glides along the ground, approaching with the slow surety of a ticking clock. You close your eyes, unwilling to look upon your killer. Your fingers dig into your palm, and you brace yourself.\n"
