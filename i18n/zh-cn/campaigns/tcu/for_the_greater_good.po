msgid "Ever since your brush with death at Hangman’s Hill, the situation in Arkham has only worsened. In the days since, there have been more reports of “ghost sightings” and even several more disappearances. A thin layer of grey mist lingers over the streets at all hours, day and night. As soon as the sun begins to set each evening, doors are shut and locked. Without truly realizing why, very few people dare venture out at night. Some businesses have even closed their doors to customers during the day, citing “poor weather.” Things are getting out of hand."
msgstr "自打你在绞刑者山丘与死神擦肩而过，阿卡姆城的情况进一步恶化。在那之后的几天里，出现了更多有关“遇鬼”的报导，失踪事件也频频发生。阿卡姆的街道上时刻笼罩著一层薄薄的灰雾，不分画夜。太阳一落山，家家户户便关门上锁。尽管没什么人明白真正的原因，但大家还是不敢在夜晚出门。一些商店甚至以“天气恶劣”为由，在白天也关上大门不做生意。事态逐渐失控。"

msgid "The creature that appeared at the Lodge’s charity gala is clearly not bound to Josef Meiger’s manor, which means the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. It is time to report your findings to the Silver Twilight Lodge. Perhaps they can help interpret the knowledge you’ve gathered, and inform you as to what your next step should be. With their help, you may be able to save Arkham…"
msgstr "秘社慈善晚宴上出现的那头怪物显然与约瑟夫·梅吉尔的庄园无关，这意味著更可怕的还在后头。是时候将你的发现汇报给银暮秘社了。或许他们能够解读你搜集到的知识，告诉你下一步该做什么。有了他们的援助，你也许就能拯救阿卡姆了……"

msgid "…though you suspect the Lodge has other interests. The Lodge clearly knows more about what is happening than they care to admit. There is a sinister purpose that lurks beneath the surface of the Lodge, and you intend to discover what that purpose is."
msgstr "……但你推测秘社另有意图。显然秘社对于此事的真相还有所保留，不愿如实吐露。你打算找出秘社所隐瞒的歹毒目的究竟是什么。"

msgid "The creature that appeared at the Lodge’s charity gala is clearly not bound to Josef Meiger’s manor, which means the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. You’re not sure why just yet, but you know the Silver Twilight Lodge is connected to the creature in some way. Perhaps it’s time to pay the Lodge a visit—with or without their permission."
msgstr "秘社慈善晚宴上出现的那头怪物显然与约瑟夫·梅吉尔的庄园无关，这意味著更可怕的还在后头。虽然现在还不知道为什么，但你明白银暮秘社与那头怪物有著某种联系。或许是时候该探访秘社了——不管他们批准与否。"

msgid "You can’t help but wonder if you missed something important in the home of Josef Meiger. The four disappearances that occurred at the Lodge’s charity gala could not have been a coincidence. If those victims encountered a creature like the one you saw at the graveyard, the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. You’re not sure why just yet, but you are sure that the Silver Twilight Lodge is connected to these events in some way. Perhaps it’s time to pay the Lodge a visit—with or without their permission."
msgstr "你不禁回想，是不是自己在约瑟夫·梅吉尔的庄园里错过了什么重要信息。秘社慈善晚宴上发生的四起失踪事件绝非巧合。如果几位受害者遭遇的正是你在墓地看到的怪物，那这意味著更可怕的还在后头。虽然现在还不知道为什么，但你确信银暮秘社与这几起事件有著某种联系。或许是时候该探访秘社了——不管他们批准与否。"

msgid "Too many disappearances have occurred at Josef Meiger’s estate for it to be a coincidence: first, the four victims at the charity gala, then the ones who attended the benefit dinner one week later. If they encountered a creature like the one you saw at the graveyard, the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. You’re not sure why just yet, but you are sure that the Silver Twilight Lodge is connected to these events in some way. Perhaps it’s time to pay the Lodge a visit—with or without their permission."
msgstr "在约瑟夫·梅吉尔庄园里发生的失踪事件之多，已经无法用巧合来形容：首先是慈善募捐晚会遇害的四人，然后是一周后参加慈善晚宴的宾客。如果他们遭遇的怪物正如你在墓地看到的一样，那这意味著更可怕的还在后头。虽然现在还不知道为什么，但你确信银暮秘社与这几起事件有著某种联系。或许是时候该探访秘社了——不管他们批准与否。"

"You manage to escape the building and flee on foot. As you run, you can hear a thunderous rumble coming from the manor. Several others burst through the front door behind you, too preoccupied to notice you. One yells to her companions: “Get out and gather at the Unvisited Isle! We have to perform the binding rite with or without the device!”\n"
"“What about the guardian?” A man at the gates asks.\n"
"“It’s no use,” she replies. “Just go!”\n"
"That is when the screaming begins. A spray of blood splatters against the basement window. Those who escaped immediately panic and flee.\n"
"You don’t stop or look back. You run until the building has faded behind the dense, grey mist, until you can no longer hear the screams of those still inside, until your legs can barely move.\n"
"Is this the kind of “sacrifice” the Silver Twilight Lodge believes in making? And if so, what does this mean for the “binding rite” they seek to complete at the Unvisited Isle?"

"你成功地凭藉著自己的双腿，逃出了那幢建筑。就在奔跑的时候，你还能听到庄园里传来雷鸣般的隆隆声。好几个人从你身后的大门冲了出来，全神贯注，压根没有看见你。其中一人对她的同伴喊道：“快出去，到未访之岛集合！不管有没有那件仪器，我们都得施行咒缚仪式！”\n"
"“守卫者怎么了？”门边的一名男子问道。\n"
"“指望他是没用的。”她答道，“快走！”\n"
"这时响起一声尖叫。一股鲜血喷溅在地下室的窗户上。逃出秘社的人们当即陷入恐慌，四散而逃。\n"
"你没有停下，也没有回头去看。你拔足狂奔，直到那幢建筑消失在灰暗的浓雾里，直到你再也听不见屋内的尖叫，直到你的双腿几乎再也跑不动。\n"
"这就是银暮秘社所信奉的“献祭”吗？若真是如此，这对他们在未访之岛试图完成的“咒缚仪式”意味著什么呢？"

msgid "Every fiber of your being is stretched as the box pulls you in. However, before it can accomplish its task, the lid is suddenly slammed shut by an elderly hand. You reel backward and collapse as the pulling force ceases. When your senses finally return to you, Carl Sanford is standing over you, unflappable as ever. “I see you managed to open the device without defeating its guardian. How fortunate,” he declares. He examines the box closely, removing the key and the coin from the container and recognizing them instantly. “I had a feeling you would be a valuable asset to the Lodge, but it seems I underestimated your resourcefulness. Perhaps it is time that you learn the truth behind our organization. I have a feeling you are destined for great things.” Unexpectedly, Mr. Sanford hands the puzzle box back to you, along with the components that unlocked it. “Come with me. There is much to discuss.”"
msgstr "那箱子直想将你吸入其中，拉拽著你全身每一吋皮肉。但就在你险被吸入箱中的千钧一发之际，箱盖被一位老人用手砰然合上。随著拉拽著你的力量消失，你蹒跚著后退瘫倒：你回过神来，卡尔·桑福德站在你旁边，神色依然淡定自如。“你不曾打败守卫者就把这东西打开了。真是走运。”他说道。他仔细检查这箱子，从里面取出了钥匙和硬币，马上就认出了它们的来路。“我有一种预感，你会成为秘社的得力助手，之前是我低估了你的才智。或许是时候让你了解我社背后的秘密了。我相信你是要干出一番大事业的。”出乎意料的是，桑福德先生将机关盒连同开锁的工具一同交还给你，“跟我来吧。我们好好聊聊。”"

"Every fiber of your being is stretched as the box pulls you in. However, before it can accomplish its task, you manage to reach out and slam the lid shut. You shudder uncontrollably as your senses slowly return to you. This box is more dangerous than you could have imagined. In the hands of the Lodge, it could have been a powerful weapon, though you’re not sure what they intended to do with it. Just then, you hear several Lodge members approaching. You quickly shift one of the room’s bookcases aside and hide behind it before they enter the room. “You’re sure you heard something in here? I don’t see anybody,” one of them says.\n"
"“Hm…” the other pauses, presumably inspecting the room for signs of intruders. “Must have been nothing.”\n"
"“It’s all right. We’re all a bit on edge since the trap box went missing. Come, we don’t want to be late for the ceremony. Tonight is an important night.” Their footfalls become softer as they depart. The man’s words linger in your thoughts momentarily. What did he mean by tonight being an important night? This could be just as important as the puzzle box they had been attempting to open. You quietly follow the two men as they head deep into the tunnels beneath the Lodge. You struggle to keep up with them while trying to keep your footsteps silent on the stone floor of the passageway. Finally, they enter a large door with the familiar three arrows of Silver Twilight emblazoned along its surface. Ritualistic chanting fills the hall from the other side. You approach softly, placing your ear against the door to listen in.\n"
"“Brothers and sisters,” an elderly voice announces, “thank you for coming to this hallowed gathering. The time we have long waited for approaches.” You recognize the man’s voice – it is Carl Sanford, president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and once again we must do what has to be done in order to protect it.” The crowd responds with solemn approval. “Tonight, we will complete the ritual we began many nights ago at the center of the Unvisited Isle. Tonight, we will finally bind the revenant and learn what it knows. We must not allow the secrets of AZATHOTH to be lost to those who would do humanity harm.”\n"
"The cult replies with a monotone hymn, and you take this opportunity to flee the Lodge before you are discovered. The conspiracy you have unveiled leaves you with even more questions. If the revenant Mr. Sanford speaks of is what you think it is, binding it will surely protect Arkham, as he claims. But what knowledge do they seek to learn from it?…and what in the hell is an “AZATHOTH?”"

"那箱子直想将你吸入其中，拉拽著你全身每一吋皮肉。但就在你险被吸入箱中的千钧一发之际，你成功够到箱盖，砰地把它合上。你控制不住地颤抖，久久才回过神来。这个箱子远比你想像的更危险。要是它落到秘社手里，就是一件强大的武器，尽管你不知道他们会用它来做些什么。说时迟那时快，你听到几名秘社成员朝这儿赶来。你迅速将房间里一个书柜移开，赶在他们进屋之前躲在书柜后。“你真的听见这儿有声音吗？我一个人都没瞧见。”其中一人说道。\n"
"“唔……”另外一人话音稍停，大概在观察房间里有没有人闯入的迹象，“定是我听错了。”\n"
"“行了。陷阱盒子丢了后，咱都有点烦躁。走吧，仪式别迟到了。今晚至关紧要。”他们离开的脚步声渐不可闻。那人的话语声一时间回荡在你脑海里。他说的“今晚至关紧要”是什么意思？或许他们所说的事情，跟尝试打开机关盒一样重要。你悄声跟随著那两名男子，走入秘社地下的隧道深处。你努力地让自己跟上他们的步伐，同时尽量不在石道上留下脚步声。最后他们进了三扇相近的窄门，门上饰有“银暮秘社”的纹样。门的另一头充斥著仪式的咏唱声。你轻轻靠近，耳朵贴在门上去听屋内的响动。\n"
"“姊妹们，弟兄们。”一道沧桑的噪音宣布：“感谢你们来到本场神圣的集会。我们期盼已久的时刻终于到来了。”你认出了这个声音——是银暮秘社的会长卡尔·桑福德。“银暮修道会在过去的几十年里，苦心追寻能够造福全人类的知识。我们曾击退外敌，捍卫组织存亡。我们为这神圣的目标牺牲一切。而今正有外敌威胁我们的城市，我们要再一次挺身而出保卫家园。”群众报以肃穆赞同。“今晚，我们将完成几日前在未访之岛中央启动的仪式。今晚，我们将缚鬼伏邪，掌握亡灵所知的一切。我们绝不容许‘阿飒拖思’的秘密落入恶人手中。”\n"
"作为回应，秘会成员开始乏味的吟咏，此时你趁无人察觉，溜出了秘会。你刚刚所发现的阴谋，让你产生了更多的疑问。如果桑福德所说的亡灵跟你所想的一样，那么如他所说，将它咒缚定能保护阿卡姆城周全。但他们想要从亡灵身上得到什么知识呢？……而“阿飒拖思”又是什么鬼？"

"The beast that had emerged from the box was a vicious guardian, slaughtering anyone in its path. Somehow you were able to slay the creature, but the consequences were dire. Many Lodge members were gruesomely killed by the creature’s rampage before you were able to put it down. Worse, the device it emerged from was destroyed beyond recognition. You’re not sure whether it broke as a result of the beast’s emergence or as a result of its death, but either way, it is a regretful outcome. “This didn’t work as planned,” one of the robed members of the Order states matter-of-factly as you examine the crushed puzzle box.\n"
"“That’s a hell of an understatement,” another adds. She places a hand on your shoulder and gently pulls you away from the remains of the device. “Come on, that’s a lost cause,” she says.\n"
"Her partner ignores your presence and stoically addresses her. “We’ll have to get to the Unvisited Isle and complete the binding rite without the trap.” She nods and takes one last look at you before the remaining Lodge members flee the building. Is this the kind of “sacrifice” the Silver Twilight Lodge believes in making? And if so, what does this mean for the “binding rite” they seek to complete at the Unvisited Isle?"

"箱中出现的怪物正是邪恶的守卫者，遇人便杀。不知为何你竟有办法能杀死那头怪物，尽管后果十分恐怖。在它被你打倒之前，许多秘社成员已惨死在它的暴行之下。更糟糕的是，出现怪物的箱子已被摧毁得面目全非。你不知道它被摧毁的原因是那怪物的出现，还是那怪物的死亡，但不论原因是什么，这结果令人扼腕。“这跟计划的不一样。”在你查看损坏的机关盒时，一名身著长袍的修道会成员淡然说道。\n"
"另一名成员加了一句：“你说得倒是轻巧。”她将手放在你的肩膀上，轻轻地将你从那箱子的残骸旁边推开，说道：“别难过，失败是早已注定的。”\n"
"她的同伴无视你的存在，坚定地说：“我们必须前往未访之岛，没有陷阱也得完成咒缚仪式。”她点点头，最后看了你一眼，随后秘社残余的所有成员离开了这幢建筑。这就是银暮秘社所信奉的“献祭”吗？若真是如此，这对他们在未访之岛试图完成的“咒缚仪式”意味著什么呢？"
