"Sunday, November 22nd, 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts.\n"
"Though All Hallows’ Eve is nearly a month past, a grim melancholy lingers throughout the town. Each morning, a thick fog permeates the streets. Nights are beginning to grow longer, and if you ask around town, you’ll hear people swear that it’s getting darker, too. But despite the gloomy mood, progress continues in the sleepy town of Arkham. The election of Nathaniel Rhodes to the United States Senate has upstanding members of the community feeling optimistic about the town’s future. And tonight, at his well-appointed estate in French Hill, a man named Josef Meiger hosts the Silver Twilight Lodge’s charity gala, an annual members-only event that will turn deadly for several attendees…"

"1925年11月22日，星期天 马萨诸塞州阿卡姆\n"
"虽然万圣节已经过去了接近一个月，但整座小镇里仍有著一种可怖的阴郁。每天早晨，街道上弥漫著浓雾。夜晚逐渐变长，要是你到镇上问问，人们会信誓旦旦地告诉你，不光如此，夜晚还变得更暗了。尽管氛围阴郁，阿卡姆这座冷清的小镇里还在继续进行著选举。纳撒尼尔·罗兹竞选美国参议员，此事使社区里正派的民众对小镇的未来充满希望。今晚，在纳撒尼尔位于法兰西山的豪华庄园里，一位名叫约瑟夫·梅吉尔的男子在此举办银暮秘社一年一度的慈善募捐晚会，仅限社员参加。而对于其中几位与会者来说，这个夜晚将会要了他们的命……"

"“Ladies and gentlemen,” Josef Meiger announces, raising a glass of champagne in a toast. A hush descends on the room, until only the crackle of the fireplace and whispers of gossip can be heard. “Allow me to welcome you all into my home for this year’s charity gala. We have some very upstanding citizens here tonight, and I thank all of you for your hard work and generosity.” Cheers and murmurs of agreement fill the room. Many of the guests raise their glasses to Valentino, one of the most esteemed members of the Lodge this year, who sits at the Guest of Honor table, which is nearest to the fireplace.\n"
"Josef ’s assistant, Jerome, blends into the wall behind Josef, discreetly checking his pocket watch. In another corner of the room, the head housekeeper, Penny, walks from table to table, filling empty glasses and collecting dirty salad plates. “Each of you has done great deeds in the name of the Silver Twilight Lodge and our historic city,” Josef continues. “Next year, we will continue to shoulder this burden and do what must be done for the sake of progress.” Jerome steps forward quietly, interrupting Josef ’s speech with the unassuming confidence that comes from years of trusted service. He taps Josef lightly on his shoulder and shows him the time. “I’m afraid I am already out of time. Thank you all very much for attending,” Josef concludes, bowing. Polite applause rises from the audience, and Josef walks briskly toward the parlor, followed closely by his assistant. Two servants collect coats as latecomers trickle into the manor, and Gavriella—Josef ’s head of security—watches over the entrance with hard eyes and a clenched jaw. “Has Mr. Sanford arrived?” Josef asks curtly, tapping his polished leather shoe on the floor.\n"
"I’m afraid not,” Jerome replies, flipping through the last pages of the estate’s guest book. “But he should be here any minute, Mr. Meiger.”\n"
"“Good. I want there to be no problems whatsoever when he arrives; am I understood?” Josef calls out to Gavriella: “Make sure he is well protected.” Gavriella nods, patting the handle of her .45 in her shoulder holster. Josef turns his attention back to his assistant. “And have Penny make sure the main course is kept good and hot while we wait for Mr. Sanford’s arrival. Not a single slice is to be served without his presence.”\n"
"“Not even for Mr. Rivas, sir?” Jerome asks, glancing at Josef over the rim of his thick glasses. Josef pauses for a moment, considering.\n"
"“Pour Mr. Rivas another glass of champagne, and I am sure he will not complain. Also, I’m still waiting on those accounts I asked you about earlier today. Don’t forget,” Josef says, clapping his assistant on the shoulder before walking back into the banquet hall. Jerome nods obediently and heads upstairs.\n"
"Soon after, the dark mist would appear, and nothing would be the same."

"“女士们先生们。”约瑟夫·梅吉尔举起一杯香槟敬酒致辞。房间里突然一片寂静，只剩下壁炉的噼啪声和低声闻聊。“欢迎各位莅临寒舍，参加今年的慈善募捐晚会。今晚到场的各位良好市民，我在此对你们的辛劳与慷慨表示由衷的感谢。”欢呼声与赞同的低语声充斥著整个房间。秘社今年最受尊敬的成员瓦伦蒂诺就坐在壁炉旁边的主宾席，许多宾客向他举杯致敬。\n"
"约瑟夫的助理杰罗姆躲到约瑟夫身后的墙边，小心翼翼地查看自己的怀表。在房间的另一角，管家领班佩妮在餐桌之间走动，为空杯子添酒并且收走脏的沙拉盘。“在座的每个人都以银暮秘社和这座古老城市的名义，作出了伟大的贡献。”约瑟夫继续说道，“明年，我们将继续肩负重担，为成大计不惜一切。”杰罗姆静静地走上前来，凭藉著作为可靠助理的多年经验，不卑不亢地打断了约瑟夫的讲话。他轻轻地拍了拍约瑟夫的肩膀，给他看时间。“恐怕我已经没时间了。非常感谢各位的出席。”约瑟夫一边鞠著躬一边总结道。在观众礼貌的掌声中，约瑟夫快步向会客室走去，身后紧跟著他的助理。迟到的宾客陆续进入庄园，两名侍者正在为他们收起大衣，约瑟夫的保安总管加弗瑞拉下颌紧闭，用严厉的眼光盯紧门口。“桑福德先生到了吗？”约瑟夫简短地问道，擦得锃亮的皮鞋脚尖敲打著地面。\n"
"“我恐怕他还没到，”杰罗姆翻到庄园的宾客簿最后一页，回答道，“但他随时可能会到，梅吉尔先生。”\n"
"“说得好。不管他什么时候到，这儿都不能有任何问题；知道了吗？”约瑟夫对加弗瑞拉命令道：“千万要保护好他。”加弗瑞拉点点头，拍了拍她肩套里的点45手枪。约瑟夫将注意力转向自己的助理：“还有，在桑福德先生到来之前，让佩妮一定要保持主菜妥妥当当、热气腾腾。他没到之前，一盘菜都不能上。”\n"
"“先生，即使是里瓦斯先生也不能上菜吗？”杰罗姆透过他那厚厚的镜片看了约瑟夫一眼，问道。约瑟夫停下来思考片刻。\n"
"“再给里瓦斯先生倒杯香槟吧，我相信他不会再抱怨的。还有，我还在等著今天早些时候问你要的帐目呢。别忘了。”约瑟夫拍拍他助理的肩膀说道，然后走回宴会厅。杰罗姆顺从地点点头，朝楼上走去。\n"

"You stand guard as instructed, waiting for Mr. Sanford to appear. By now, the remaining guests have filed into the banquet hall, and you can hear the sounds of merriment and drinking coming from beyond the wooden door behind you. You pay them no mind, remaining vigilant. Years of fighting and discipline have taught you to be ready for anything, even at a harmless banquet like this. Just as you begin to ponder whether your talents are being wasted under Mr. Meiger’s employ, a dark mist invades the parlor through the front door and the window frames, flooding the room. At first, you believe it to be only the evening fog seeping through the manor’s entryway, until you begin to notice that everything the mist touches seems to have decayed as though aged hundreds of years.\n"
"You step back cautiously, keeping a hand on the grip of your weapon just in case. Never in all your years have you seen something like this. An unnatural chill spreads throughout the room, and shivers run up your spine. As the ashen mist finishes pouring in, it coalesces into a singular form: a humanoid figure wrapped in shadows. It raises its hand and points at you with a charred, blackened finger.\n"
"You unholster your firearm and point it at the creature, allowing your training to take over. “Don’t come any closer!” you shout. The thing watching you from the entrance is unfazed. Its ethereal form begins to glide toward you, dark mist crawling over the carpet in its wake. “I warned you,” you growl, and a thunderous shot echoes through the parlor as you squeeze the trigger. The bullet rips a hole in the figure’s head like a rush of air billowing through a column of smoke. The mist stitches itself together, and the thing continues to drift your way, reaching out menacingly.\n"
"Nothing could have prepared you for combat with such an unnatural enemy. Faced with no other option, you turn and flee up the staircase nearby, pausing to squeeze off several more shots at the top. The bullets that make their target simply pass harmlessly through the ghostly figure, striking the door behind it. A few stray shots shatter a column of the staircase’s wooden balustrade."

"你遵循指示站岗，等待著桑福德先生出现。现在，其余的宾客挤满了整个宴会厅，你能听到身后木门另一边传来的欢笑声与碰杯声。你对这全不在意，保持警觉。多年的实战与训练教会了你要做好一切准备，哪怕只是这样一场和谐的宴会。正当你开始思考接受梅吉尔先生的雇佣是不是在浪费自己的才华时，一团黑雾通过前门和窗户进入会客室，淹没了整个房间。一开始，你认为那只是夜晚的雾气窜进了庄园门口，但你发觉那团黑雾触碰过的一切事物似乎都已衰败，仿佛过了数百年。\n"
"你谨慎地后退，一只手始终紧握著武器以防万一。你长这么大从来没有见到过这样的景象。一股不自然的寒意扩散到整个房间，你的脊梁骨都在颤抖。当灰白色的雾气彻底灌入，它凝聚成了奇异的形状：一个包覆在阴影中的人形。它抬起了手，用一根焦黑的手指指著你。\n"
"你从枪套中取出你的手枪，对准那头生物，让过往的训练经验接管你的身体。“别再靠近了！”你大喊。从门口进来的生物正看著你，似乎未受影响。它虚无的形体朝你滑行靠近，黑雾沿著它的尾迹爬过地毯。“我警告过你了。”你咆哮著扣动扳机，一声雷鸣般的枪声回荡在会客厅里。子弹在它的脑袋上撕开了一个洞，仿佛一道气流从一柱浓烟中翻腾穿过。这团雾自行缝合，然后它继续朝你飘来，伸手迫近。\n"
"你作足一切准备也不是这个诡异敌人的对手。你别无选择，转身从旁边的楼梯往上逃，从上方再开几枪。子弹只是穿过了那个幽灵般的人形，打在它身后的门上，未对目标造成丝毫损伤。零星几发打偏的子弹击碎了楼梯木栏杆的一根柱子。"

"You carefully flip through the pages of Mr. Meiger’s ledger, looking for the accounts he inquired about. You have served Mr. Meiger faithfully for almost a decade, and he trusts you with sensitive information like this—a point of pride for you. While you are often curious about your employer’s business, you have never pried into his personal matters. Not until tonight, anyway.\n"
"You adjust your glasses and lean forward as you turn to the page regarding Mr. Meiger’s request. Some of the names on the list you recognize: Rivas, Gensler, Fairmont, Rhodes, Wick. But many are names you have never heard of before, let alone seen affiliated with Mr. Meiger’s work: Lindquist, Konstantinov, Magro, Atkinson, Lamar…Just how deep do Mr. Meiger’s connections go?\n"
"Strange as that may seem, it is the list of names on the page afterward that raises your hackles. While it was clear that the names on the previous page are associates of Mr. Meiger’s, or at least prominent members of the Lodge, you can only assume that this next series of names is of people your employer is…targeting. For what, you cannot say.\n"
"You stand next to Josef ’s desk and record the list in your pocket journal carefully, making sure to keep the names in the exact order they appear in Mr. Meiger’s ledger. You hope that your suspicion is nothing more than the absurd imagination of an overworked secretary. Still, something about all of this has you concerned. That, and the sudden draft of frigid air that has somehow wafted into the room. Your gaze naturally drifts to the window, at which point you scream out in shock and lose your balance, stumbling backward into Mr. Meiger’s desk.\n"
"Pressed up against the office window is a host of screaming faces emerging from the mist, or perhaps composed of it. Their ghostly hands press against the glass, their eyes hollow and empty. Your reading glasses clatter to the ground and shatter under your heel as you scramble to the other side of the office. You don’t realize that you dropped your pocket journal in the chaos until it is too late."

"你仔细翻看梅吉尔先生的帐本，查找他之前询问的帐目。你忠心耿耿地为梅吉尔先生服务了接近十年，他将如此敏感的信息托付给你——是你的骄傲。尽管你常常对自己老板的生意感到好奇，但你从来没有窥探过他的私事。至少，在今晚之前是的。\n"
"你翻到梅吉尔先生问到的那页帐目，你扶了扶眼镜，向前凑近。你认出了列表上的一些姓名：里瓦斯、詹斯勒、费尔蒙特、罗兹、威克。但还有很多名字你从未听过，更不知道他们与梅吉尔先生的工作有何关联：林奎斯特、康斯坦丁诺夫、玛格罗、阿特金森、拉马尔……梅吉尔先生和他们的关系有多深厚呢？\n"
"虽然这听起来很奇怪，后一页列出的名字让你汗毛倒竖。前一页的姓名明显是梅吉尔先生的生意伙伴，或至少是秘社的杰出成员，你只能设想下一串名字曾是你老板的……“目标”。你说不上来自己为什么这么想。\n"
"你站在约瑟夫的桌子旁边，确保自己按照梅吉尔帐本里列出的顺序，仔细地在自己的日记上记下了这些名宇。你希望自己的怀疑只是一个秘书劳累过度之后的荒谬想像。尽管如此，这一切之中还是有什么引起了你的担忧。担忧的除了那串名字，还有突然不知何故灌进房间里的冷空气。你的目光自然地飘向窗户，就在这时你吓得尖叫出声，身体失去了平衡，跌跌撞撞后退靠在梅吉尔先生的桌子上。\n"
"紧贴著办公室窗户的是一群尖叫著的面庞，它们从雾里涌现，抑或是由雾形成。它们幽灵般的手紧贴著玻璃，眼眶里全是空洞。就在你朝这间办公室的另一边爬去时，近视眼镜咔嗒一声掉落在地，在你脚边裂成碎片。最后你才意识到自己的随身日记已经在混乱中丢失，但已经来不及了。"

"You sigh as the cool New England air embraces you. It has been a very stressful night: stressful enough that you’ve decided to sneak away from the clamor to grab a quick smoke before heading back to work. You rest your arms along the metal railing of the balcony, your fingers trembling as they hold your cigarette. The dreary gambrel rooftops and Victorian manors of French Hill span the view below you, the unlit windows hiding countless secrets.\n"
"You can’t remember a night in which your employer was as concerned with every little detail as he is tonight. He is normally so calm, so collected. There’s something special about tonight that has him on edge. Is it Mr. Sanford? A shudder crawls through you. For some reason, something about that man gives you the creeps. But Josef has interacted with Mr. Sanford many times before, so that cannot be the reason. What could it be that has Mr. Meiger so worried?\n"
"You are torn from your thoughts by the gathering of grey clouds overhead, swiftly blotting out the night sky. As the clouds grow ever closer, you begin to see shapes emerging from the vapor. You squint and lean over the railing for a better view. That is when you notice the true forms of the shapes in the mist: their screaming faces, their clawing hands, all writhing in torment and coming straight for you. You cry out in terror and back up against the wall as the mist envelops the building. A spectral shape emerges from the haze beyond the railing, dressed in bloodstained rags. It begs for rest in a croaking, gasping voice. Your only hope for escape is to retreat back into the manor and call for help…"

"新英格兰的冷空气将你拥入怀中，你叹了一口气。今晚压力很大：压力大到你决定要从这嘈杂声中溜出去，抽一小会烟再回来工作。你将手臂靠在露台的金属栏杆上稍作歇息，手指颤抖著夹紧香烟。向下望去是乏味的复折式屋顶和法兰西山的维多利亚式庄圈，没有亮起的窗户暗藏著数不尽的秘密。\n"
"在你的记忆中，老板约瑟夫·梅吉尔从没像今晚这样在意每一个细节。他平时是那么地冷静、沉稳。今晚有些特别的事情让他焦躁不安。是桑福德先生吗？一股战栗爬上你的脊梁。因为某些原因，那人身上的某些东西让你毛骨悚然。但老板之前与桑福德先生有过几次接触，所以这不是他紧张的原因。究竟是什么让梅吉尔先生这么紧张？\n"
"你的思绪被头顶凝聚的乌云打破，它们迅速遮蔽了整片夜空。随著乌云的靠近，你逐渐看见云雾里浮现出一些身影。你瞇起眼睛俯在栏杆上，想看得更清楚些。这时你发现了云雾里那些身影的真面目：它们尖叫著的面庞、向外攫夺的手臂都在痛苦地扭曲著，直直向你逼近。雾气笼罩了整幢建筑，你惊恐大叫，后退到墙壁前。栏杆外的薄雾里涌现出一个幽灵的身影，身披血迹斑斑的破布。它用嘶哑、喘息的声音祈求得到安息。你逃跑的唯一希望就是返回庄园，寻求帮助……"

"“Are you going to break, or are you going to sit there admiring the cue ball all night?” you ask with a mocking smile. Your opponent sets the ivory ball back on the table with a sigh.\n"
"“I can’t help myself around ivory. You know that, Tino,” Adam replies. You rarely see Adam Gensler except during Lodge functions, but you prefer his company to that of the stuffy business types who make up most of the Lodge these days. He makes his shot, the sudden clattering interrupting the din of conversation. “Your shot, Tino. And do try to avoid hitting the nine ball first. You’re always so overeager.” Adam chuckles as he moves to the other side of the table, making way for you.\n"
"“That was one time, my friend, one time.” You roll your eyes. Truth be told, you’ve enjoyed coming to these events for the opportunity to give back to the community, not to hobnob with Arkham’s gentry. But hobnobbing has had its perks.\n"
"You lean over the table and clear your mind as you line up your shot. The room falls silent as you block out the clamor and the music, focusing all of your attention on the one ball and the corner pocket. You hold your breath and strike the cue ball. It clacks as it hits its target, and the one ball drops effortlessly into the corner pocket. “There, you see?”\n"
"It is only then that you realize the silence around you is not just in your mind. All of the light and warmth has been sucked out of the room. Adam is gone, along with everyone else who was present just moments before you took your shot. “Hello?” you call out. A dark mist coils about your ankles as you walk around the billiards table. “If this is a practical joke of some kind, it’s in awfully poor taste,” you remark. The only response is the deep growl that emerges from beneath the table. Morbid curiosity compels you to look underneath it, at which point a dark hound pounces onto your chest, savagely clawing at your torso. You react instinctively, pushing it off of your body as hard as you can. It lands on the billiards table, causing it to collapse under the creature’s weight. You slowly back up as the creature rises to its feet once again and jumps off the broken table, its hollow eyes gazing into your soul."

"“你是要休息一会儿，还是说继续坐在这儿，用整晚的时间来观赏这颗白球？”你面带讥讽，笑著问道。你的对手将象牙白的台球放回桌面，叹了口气。\n"
"“我控制不住自己想著那颗球。你知道的，蒂诺。”亚当回答说。除了秘社活动，你很少见到亚当·詹斯勒，但你更喜欢亚当的陪伴，因为比起他来，秘社里大部分成员都是些古板的生意人。他打了一杆球，这突然的碰击声打断了谈话的嘈杂声。“轮到你了，蒂诺。试试先别打中九号球。你总是太过心急。”亚当轻笑著走到桌子的另一边，给你让出了位子。\n"
"“我的朋友，我就干过一次这事，就一次。”你翻了个白眼。老实说，你参加这样的活动是为了回馈社会，而不是为了跟阿卡姆的上流社会碰杯的。但喝酒也有它的好处。\n"
"你俯身靠近桌子，让脑子保持清醒，瞄准好球杆。你把注意力集中到一颗台球和角袋，将喧闹声和音乐声屏退，整个房间陷入寂静。你屏住呼吸，球杆向白球击去。它命中了目标，轻轻松松地将目标撞入角袋。“喏，看见了没？”\n"
"在这时你才意识到周围的寂静不仅存在于你的脑海中。这房间里的全部光照与温度都被抽走了。亚当不见了，在你撃球之前还在的所有人都不见了。“喂？”你大声叫喊。你绕著台球桌走动，同时一团黑雾缠上了你的脚踝。“要是这是在开玩笑，那这玩笑的品味真是糟糕透顶。”你说道。只有桌子底下传来的低沉咆哮声回应你。病态的好奇心驱使你向下望，这时一头黑色的猎犬扑向你的胸口，野蛮地抓著你的身体。你本能地作出反应，用尽全力将它从你的身上推开。它落在台球桌上，重量把桌子都压塌了。你慢慢后退，此时那头生物再次起身，从垮塌的球桌跃起，它空洞的双眼凝视盯著你的灵魂。"

"“Mr. Sanford, thank you so much for coming. I know you are a busy man. Your presence at tonight’s meeting is very much appreciated.” Josef shakes Carl Sanford’s hand firmly as he speaks. Sanford merely nods. “I know you’ve only just arrived, but I have some…private matters to discuss with you, if that is all right,” Josef continues, his narrow eyes shifting back and forth between the men flanking Mr. Sanford.\n"
"“Very well.” The elderly man nods to his two enforcers, who step aside to give him privacy. He cradles his hands behind his back, his stature impressive for his age. His discerning eyes fall on Josef. “What is the matter?”\n"
"Josef leans closer. “It’s here, sir. It’s here in this very house.”\n"
"There is a quiet pause between the two men, and then Carl Sanford smiles."

"“桑福德先生，非常感谢您的到来。我知道您是个大忙人。非常感谢您来出席今晚的会议。”约瑟夫紧紧握住卡尔·桑福德的手对他说。桑福德只是点点头。“我知道您刚到这儿来，但我有些……私人问题想跟您讨论，如果您不介意的话。”约瑟夫继续说道，他狭长的眼睛望向桑福德身侧的几名男子，目光在他们之间迅速移动。\n"
"“好的。”年迈的桑福德对自己的两名保镖点头示意，令他们走到一边去，给他一些私人空间。他双手在身后轻轻交握，在如此年纪仍然保持著挺拔的身姿。他锐利的目光落在约瑟夫身上：“什么事？”\n"
"约瑟夫俯身靠近：“就在这儿，先生。就在这幢房子里。”\n"
"两人沉默片刻，随即卡尔·桑福德展露出一抹微笑。"
