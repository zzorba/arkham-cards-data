"It is a breezy November evening in Arkham—the perfect night for a walk through Independence Square, or so you had thought, up until the moment Anna Kaslow offered to tell your fortune. You agreed, though you would soon come to regret this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck, she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune. Judgment. Temperance. Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n"
"“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

"这夜凉风习习，是阿卡姆十一月的一个夜晚——这个晚上在独立广场散个步再好不过，或者说在安娜·卡斯洛主动给你算命之前，你是这么认为的。你答应让她给你算命，但你很快就后悔了这个决定。吉普赛占卜师从牌库里抽出的每一张牌，都编织出一个绝望与不幸的故事。审判。节制。正义。隐士。倒吊人。教皇。恋人。战车。命运之轮。安娜即将完成占卜，她抽出最顶上的塔罗牌，将它放在牌阵中央。牌阵中最为重要的这张牌残破、老旧，上面画有不祥的图案：高耸的黑玛瑙建筑。暴风雨如同地狱般在塔顶肆虐，乌云里一道闪电落下。这张牌写著：高塔·XVI。虽然接下来的解牌都很顺利，但看到中央的那张牌还是让你打了个寒颤。此时此刻，它就像一副合上棺盖的棺材，盛装著你的尸体。\n"
"“你跟我说过，让我直接把它给你。”占卜师说道。她盘腿坐在你面前，表情冷酷。从她坚定的目光和冷酷的眼神，你看得出安娜并不满足于这次解牌。“如果只是不幸，你是不会紧张的。”她解释说，“这关系生死。”她望向高塔周围的塔罗牌——它们全都呈现逆位——专注地盯著这些牌。“你看不见的一切都与你对立。唯独你一人挡了它们的路。”她神秘兮兮地说。"

msgstr "<i>“我怎样才能避免这样的命运呢？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“This is bullshit.”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“一派胡言”</i>"

msgid "The woman nods and draws the top card of the deck with a steady hand, revealing it to you without looking at it herself. Depicted on the card is a single wooden wand, surrounded by a pattern of broken stained glass. It reads: ACE OF RODS. “You must be ready to act,” she advises. “Without hesitation. Without regret. When the opportunity arises, you must set into motion the events that will change this fate.”"
msgstr "安娜点了点头，沉稳地抽出了牌库最顶上的牌，没有看那张牌的内容，直接对你亮牌。那张牌上画的是一根木质权杖，周围是破损的彩绘玻璃。这张牌写著：权杖王牌。“你必须准备好采取行动。”她提出建议，“别犹豫。别后悔。机会来临的时候，你必须行动起来改变命运。”"

msgid "you have accepted your fate."
msgstr "你接受了自己的命运。"

msgid "Before drawing their opening hand for this scenario, the lead investigator searches the collection for 1 copy of The Tower · XVI and 1 copy of Ace of Rods and adds each of them to their deck, if able. The lead investigator has earned these cards. They do not count toward their deck size. (If one or both of these cards are not available, skip this step.)"
msgstr "在调查员队长抽取本场冒险的起始手牌前，如可能，该调查员从收藏中找出1张“高塔·XVI”和1张“权杖王牌”，将这2张牌加入自己的牌组。调查员队长获得这些卡牌，它们不计入该调查员的卡牌张数。(如果上述卡牌中有任何卡牌不可用，跳过本步骤。)"

msgid "The woman smirks. “Yes, in a sense, I suppose it is,” she responds. With a single swift motion, she picks up each of the cards displayed before you, save for The Tower card, and shuffles them back into the deck. “The cards only reveal and advise. They cannot influence or impose.” She locks eyes with you, and her smile vanishes from her face. “In other words, though your fate is not set in stone, I assure you the danger you face is not ‘bullshit.’ It is real.” Her eyes narrow. “It is very real.”"
msgstr "安娜得意地笑了。“没错，在某种意义上说，我希望这是一派胡言。”她重复道。她快速地拿起所有摆在你面前的塔罗牌，留下高塔牌在桌面，将其余塔罗牌洗回了牌库。“塔罗牌只会揭示和建议，不会影响，也不会强加。”她的眼神锁定了你，笑容从她脸上消失。“换句话来说，虽然你的命运未成定数，但我向你保证，你面临的危险可不是什么‘一派胡言’，而是真实存在的。”她的眼睛眯了起来，“非常真实。”"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>you have rejected your fate</i>. Add 2 [elder_thing] tokens to the chaos bag for the remainder of the campaign."

"Silence hangs in the air as you peer into The Tower card. The world around you dissolves into emptiness as your eyes fixate on the onyx tower. Rolling thunder echoes in the distance. “Do you understand now?” Anna asks. There is no other sign of the soothsayer: only her strained voice. A bolt of lightning streaks across the sky. “Do you see your fate before you, as I do?”\n"
"Another resounding crack of thunder, and you are suddenly awake. Icy rain pelts your body, soaking you through to the bone. You are lying in the mud beside a wooded trail, and there is no other soul in sight…"
msgstr ""
"你看著高塔牌的时候，空气中笼罩著寂静。你的双眼凝视著黑玛瑙高塔，周围的世界溶为虚空。远方回响著滚滚的雷声。“你现在懂了吗？”安娜问道。你不见占卜师的踪影：只听见她紧张的声音。一道闪电划过夜空。“你是不是跟我一样，也看见了自己未来的命运？”\n"
"又一道雷声巨响，你突然醒来。冰冷的雨水打在你身上，将你彻底淋湿。你躺在泥地里，旁边是一条树木繁茂的小路，视野里一个人都没有……"

"Act 1a—“Lost in the Woods” has the text: “Locations in front of you are connected to one another.” This text means that regardless of location/connection symbols, the locations in front of you are considered to be connected to one another, and enemies and investigators may move between them. Locations remain connected to one another via their location/connection symbols, as well.\n"
"However, Lost in the Woods also has the text: “You cannot enter locations in front of other investigators.” This means that you cannot move to a location in front of another investigator, even if the two locations are connected or if you are moving via a card effect.

"Despite her wounds, the leader of the coven rises to her feet. More of the hooded figures emerge from the tree line, eager to defend their leader. “Interloper!” one calls you, pulling off her hood and pointing a gnarled wooden rod in your direction. Her bright-red hair glows in the firelight, embers dancing about her extended hand. “They’re the ones from before, High Priestess: the ones who interfered with our great work.”\n"
"The “High Priestess” holds up a single hand, and a hush falls over the other witches. “As always, I admire your perseverance, sister. But I do not believe these are the ones you speak of,” she replies to the red-haired accuser. You lower your weapons as several of the hooded figures approach and surround their leader. They begin chanting in a soft tone as they examine her wounds. The red-haired witch crosses her arms and watches you with a hard glare, her gaze never straying far from you. “I am Anette,” says the leader of the coven, “and these are my sisters. Tell me: Who are you, and why are you here?”\n"
"You explain how you awoke in the woods, how you were attacked by terrible creatures, and how you came to the center of this circle in order to break the spell surrounding the woods. Anette’s eyes narrow as she hears your story. “That is impossible. The circle was closed. None could enter the woods while we were completing our spell.” She grits her teeth. “You must go at once. This is not your place.”\n"
"“But, High Priestess!—” the red-haired witch exclaims, only to be interrupted by Anette’s gaze. The two lock eyes, a battle of wills that quickly proves Anette victorious.\n"
"“Stand down, Erynn,” Anette says with a firm, motherly tone, as though admonishing a child. She turns her attention back to you as the witch named Erynn lowers her head in defeat. “Go. You’ve broken the spell, just as you desired. You can leave the woods now. But I give you one final warning: cross us again, and we will not be so merciful.”\n"
"You begin to protest, but before you are able to utter a single word, a dark gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing. Shadows from beyond the tree line suddenly twist and coil into the clearing, tugging at the edges of the witches’ cloaks. One by one, the shadows twist and pull each of the witches into the darkness beyond. In moments, they are gone. You are left with only the soft glow of moonlight to guide you home."

"尽管遍体鳞伤，女巫集会的领导者还是站起身来。越来越多兜帽覆面的人影从树林里现身，想要保护她们的领导者。“入侵者！”其中一人朝你喊道，同时摘下自己的兜帽，用一根粗糙的木杖指著你。她鲜亮的红发在火光中闪动，伸出的手上有灰烬在飞舞。“女祭司大人，他们就是来自过去之人，曾妨碍我们的大事。”\n"
"“女祭司”举起一手，其他女巫都缄口不语。“妹妹，我一向佩服你的坚持。但我相信他们不是你所说的人。”她向红发女子答道。你放低了自己的武器，数名戴著兜帽的人靠近领袖，围在她周围。她们开始轻声诵咒，同时检查她的伤势。红发女巫双手交叉，用严厉的目光注视著你，视线片刻不离。“我是安妮特。”女巫集会的领导者说道，“而这些是我的姐妹。告诉我：你是谁，你为什么到这儿来？”\n"
"你解释说，你是如何在树林里醒来，如何被恐怖的生物袭击，又是如何为了破坏笼罩树林的法术而来到圆环中央。安妮特听著你的描述，眼睛瞇了起来：“那是不可能的。圆环已经关闭了。在我们施术的时候没人能够踏入这片树林。”她咬紧牙关说道，“你必须马上离开。这不是你该来的地方。”\n"
"“但是，女祭司大人——！”这名红发女巫大声叫喊，被安妮特看了一眼后闭上了嘴。她们四目相对，很快红发女巫就在安妮特的目光下败下阵来。\n"

"你想要抗议，但你还没来得及说出一个字，一阵黑风就把空地中央的火焰吹熄了。树林以外的黑影突然缠绕、旋入地面，拉扯著女巫们的披风边缘。一个接一个，黑影将所有女巫都拖入了另一头的黑暗之中。转瞬之间，她们消失得无影无踪。你留在原地，只有温柔的月光指引你回家的路。"
