"Residents of French Hill are still in a tizzy after the sudden disappearance of several guests and house staff from the home of Mr. Josef Meiger during the night of the annual Silver Twilight charity gala last Sunday. “We are absolutely baffled as to how this could have happened,” said Mr. Meiger the day after the disappearances. “That said, we are confident that Sheriff Engle and the Arkham Police will do their due diligence in finding the missing persons.”\n"
"There is still no evidence whatsoever as to the whereabouts of Miss Gavriella Mizrah, Mr. Jerome Davids, Mr. Valentino Rivas, and Mrs. Penny White, all of whom vanished halfway through the event and have not been seen since. The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.\n"
"So far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”\n"

"上周日的银暮秘社周年慈善夜活动期间，数名宾客及约瑟夫·梅吉尔先生家的工作人员突然消失，法兰西山的居民们至今仍人心惶惶。“我们完全搞不懂这事情怎么可能会发生。”梅吉尔先生在失踪事件发生的第二天说道，“即便如此，我们仍然对恩格尔警长和阿卡姆警局抱有信心，相信他们会尽最大努力寻找失踪人口。”\n"
"目前仍然没有任何与加弗瑞拉·米兹拉克女士、杰罗姆·戴维斯先生、瓦伦蒂诺·里瓦斯先生和佩妮·怀特夫人有关的证据，他们在宴会进行到一半时消失，再也没有出现。如有任何人士提供上述失踪事件的有关信息，警方将予以丰厚酬劳。当问及警方是否将这宗案件视为凶杀案时，恩格尔警长说道：“现在还没有理由怀疑这是一宗谋杀案。但是，根据目前情况，我们必须考虑到每种可能性。”没有其他与会者就慈善宴会作出声明，尽管有人失踪，宴会依然圆满结束。\n"
"至今为止，银暮秘社的杰出成员无一人对秘社即将在同一地点举行的慈善晚宴表示担心：位于法兰西山的约瑟夫·梅吉尔庄园。“我相信这次活动一定会取得圆满成功。”梅吉尔先生在昨天的采访中对阿卡姆报社记者如是说，\"各位阿卡姆市民无须担心。”\n"

"You fold up the newspaper and shove it aside on your desk, examining the other files you’ve collected over the last few days concerning the missing persons. It has been several days since your experience in the woods. You have tried to put it all out of mind, but it is impossible. Every night, you dream of a nameless place in the void of space, a faint discordant melody of hypnotizing flutes pulling you forward. Now there are others disappearing from the town without a trace. The disappearances dance along the edges of your thoughts. <i>No reason to worry</i>, you ponder, turning the man’s words over in your head. You think of the card reader and her warning, and you wonder if you are simply imagining devils where there are none. Regardless, there is only one way to know for sure. You pick up the invitation, examining the silver-embossed stationary and perfect calligraphy.\n"

While nobody is looking, you follow the handrail up and down the stairs until you spot what you are looking for: several splinters of wood, perhaps dislodged by a bullet. You ascend the staircase once more and position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun. A gun was indeed fired in the entry hall of the manor—but if that is true, how did nobody hear the shots?"

Perhaps he’s just a fastidious person…or perhaps he’s been scrubbing evidence of some wrongdoing. You find nothing of note in any of Josef’s files, but after some perusing, you realize there is one place you haven’t checked: the trash. Rooting through the garbage bin yields fruit. Near the bottom is a small pocket journal belonging to Jerome Davids, probably tossed there carelessly by the cleaning staff. You turn to the last page. There, Jerome had recorded a list of names, perhaps transcribed from Josef ’s records. You don’t know what it means yet, but it must be important."
msgstr "约瑟夫·梅吉尔的个人办公室相当整洁，但他的秘书刚刚才失踪。或许他只是个一丝不苟的人……又或许他是在掩盖罪证。你在约瑟夫的档案里找不到任何值得注意的地方，但仔细研读过后，你发现你少找了一处地方：垃圾桶。垃圾桶总能翻到宝的。垃圾桶深处有一本小小的随身日记，它的主人是杰罗姆·戴维斯，大概是被清洁工不小心扔到这里来的。你翻到了最后一页。杰罗姆在这页上记录了一排名字，或许是从约瑟夫的文件里抄录的。你暂时还不知道这些名字有什么意义，但这一定很重要。"

According to eyewitnesses, Penny was last seen entering Josef ’s bedroom, presumably to tidy it up, or perhaps to look for one of his personal belongings. The cigarette butt on the floor of the balcony tells a different story. Penny came here for a break, and judging from how busy the rest of the staff is, it was probably a much-needed one. If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help…only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up. You tuck the cigarette butt into your coat pocket, hoping it’s actually a lead and not a wild goose chase."
msgstr "站在约瑟夫·梅吉尔卧室外的露台，能将下著雨的街道与法兰西山那昏暗的尖顶尽收眼底。据目击者所说，他最后一次看见佩妮时，她走进了约瑟夫的卧室，猜想她是去打扫整理，或者是去找约瑟夫的个人物品。露台地面的烟屁股表明，情况并非如此。佩妮是到这儿透透气的，从其他工作人员的忙碌不难看出，今晚可能真的需要休息。要是她遇到了危险，她会不会从露台往上爬，或往下跳呢？你探头往外看。确实有这样的可能性，但是不大。从这儿掉下去至少会断条腿。她更可能原路返回……本来她能回到庄园求救，但是，没有一人看到她从那间卧室里出来。这有点说不通。你将烟屁股放入大衣口袋，期望这会是一条线索，别让你扑个空。"

This makes the story that he “vanished when they weren’t looking” all the more unbelievable. In the billiards room, where Valentino was last seen, you corner Adam Gensler, the man he was playing billiards with just before his disappearance. “Look, I already told the cops and the reporters what I saw,” he explains, fidgeting and tapping his toes repeatedly. “Tino and I were playing billiards, I looked away, next thing I know he’s gone,” he insists angrily, returning to his billiards game. “Now where is that damned one ball?” he mutters. It might be nothing, but it looks like Valentino wasn’t the only thing to go missing that night."
msgstr "追寻瓦伦蒂诺的足迹算不上什么难事。作为主宾(从你听到的消息看来，他还是整场宴会的主角)，他总是前拥后簇。从这一点看来，“他在无人注意的情况下消失”的说法完全站不住脚。在台球室，瓦伦蒂诺最后被目击的地点，你将亚当·詹斯勒堵在角落，瓦伦蒂诺消失之前就在和他打台球。“听著，我早就把我看到的事情都告诉警察和记者了。”他烦躁地解释道，脚尖不耐烦地点著地。“我和蒂诺当时在打台球，我一转头他就不见了。”他愤怒地说著，继续打台球。“那颗混帐球哪去了？”他抱怨道。这或许说明不了什么，但似乎那天夜里消失的不止瓦伦蒂诺。"

"You are startled from your reverie by the sensation of something crawling up your chest, an icy hand that clasps around your throat. It grips until your breath is trapped and your windpipe starts to crack. Only there is nothing there—just a chilly draft entering the room through the open window. The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\n"
"The cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\n"
"NO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n"

Before any threats can be fulfilled, the silence is broken by an icy voice. “Now gentlemen, there is no need for that.” The men withdraw to reveal an elderly man you recognize as Carl Sanford, the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. Despite the dangerous situation, his expression is almost too casual. The complete lack of fear in his posture and his actions suggests a confidence backed by substantial power. His bodyguards take several steps back, allowing you to speak with Mr. Sanford in private."

msgid "You head out of the manor and are embraced by the brisk evening air. Your investigation has left you exhausted and strangely paranoid. Something about that event felt peculiar to you, though you aren’t sure why. Although the guests seemed oblivious, you noticed that the staff was sweaty and jittery, and the Lodge members seemed tense as well. More than once, you noticed their gaze drawn to you, watching your every move. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think the Silver Twilight Lodge was having you tailed for some reason. Regardless, you weren’t able to find much information about the four disappearances, and you doubt you ever will. Perhaps it was nothing, after all."

The creature reconstitutes before you, and its charred hand grips your throat, holding you aloft with tremendous strength. You kick and dig your nails into the creature’s hand, struggling with the ferocity of a cornered animal, but it is no use. The last thing you see is the red glare of the thing’s eyes as it drills into your mind."
