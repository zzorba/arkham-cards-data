msgid "Scenario VII: In the Clutches of Chaos"
msgstr "冒险VII：混沌魔掌"

msgid "After what you saw at the Unvisited Isle, your faith in humanity is on thin ice. You feel like a wayward spirit, wandering the streets with no destination in mind. You wish you could just return home and forget everything that has happened in the last few weeks, but you know that is just a pipe dream. After hours of aimless meandering, you snap back to reality when you realize you have wandered into Independence Square. A soft breeze carries a trail of brittle leaves across the grass of the clearing, drawing your eyes upward. There, sitting amidst a circle of autumn-colored leaves, sits Anna Kaslow. Her eyes are closed in a deep trance, her fingers pressed against the temples of her head. Laid out on the grass in front of her is a wool blanket, and on top of that, a circle of overlapping facedown tarot cards. You approach and take a seat in front of the fortune teller. It’s only now that you realize just how sore and tired you are. Every one of your muscles aches with pain, and it takes a significant amount of effort for you to not immediately pass out."
msgstr "在你亲眼目睹未访之岛的景象过后，你对人类的信任已所剩无几。你像个游魂，漫无目的在街上游荡，你真希望自己能回家去，把这几个星期发生的事情都忘掉，但你知道这是不可能的。漫无目的地游荡了数小时后，你意识到自己走进了独立广场，这时你很快回过神来。柔和的微风把脆弱的树叶吹落，扫过空旷的草坪，吸引你抬眼望去。安娜·卡斯洛就坐在秋叶形成的一个圆圈中间。她深陷恍惚之中，闭著眼睛，手指按压著太阳穴。她面前的草坪上放著一条羊毛毯子，上面摆放著面朝下的塔罗牌，一张压著一张摆作一个圆圈。你走过去，坐在占卜师前方。你现在才意识到你是多么痛苦，多么疲惫。你身上的每一块肌肉在发疼，得拼命坚持才能不让自己痛晕过去。"

msgid "You recognize the soothsayer from your investigation into the disappearances at Josef Meiger’s manor. It was her advice that led the second set of victims to their doom, or so you suspect. Oddly enough, she appears to recognize you, as well. She runs her fingers along the circle of cards before her. “I suspect the past few weeks have been quite arduous for you. Are you here for guidance?” You grimace. The last time Anna read somebody’s fortune, it did not end well for them. What makes you think you will be any different?"
msgstr "你认出了这位占卜师，你在调查约瑟夫·梅吉尔庄园的失踪事件时见过她。她给的建议导致了第二批受害者的死亡，至少你是这么认为的。奇怪的是，她似乎也认出了你。她的手指摸著面前的一圈塔罗牌：“我猜过去的几个礼拜你过得很艰难。你是来寻求指引的吗？”你面露苦涩。安娜上一次解读他人的命运时，对方并没有得到一个好下场。你凭什么觉得她这一次占卜会不一样？"

msgid "Anna opens her eyes. “I was wondering when we would meet again.” You wonder aloud how she could possibly not know, when everything else she has predicted has come to pass. Your remark earns you a hearty chuckle from the soothsayer. “That doesn’t mean I know everything, my dear.” She runs her fingers across the circle of cards. “I suspect the past few weeks have been quite arduous for you. Are you here for more guidance?” You grimace. This all began with a reading of your fortune. What makes you think another reading will make this all go away?"
msgstr "安娜睁开眼睛。“我刚正在想我们什么时候会再见面。你大声质问她，她预言的一切都成真了，怎么可能不知道。你的话换来了占卜师的大笑：“那不代表我知道一切呀，亲爱的。”她的手指穿过面前的一圈塔罗牌：“我猜过去的几个礼拜你过得很艰难。你又来寻求指引吗？”你面露苦涩。这一切都是从你占卜命运开始的。你凭什么认为再占卜一次就能让这一切都消失？"

msgid ""
"Before you can answer, Anna turns over the card closest to her. It depicts a furtive hooded figure with five swords embedded in the ground around it. Others cower and flee before the victorious figure, and a maelstrom of dark clouds brew over its head. Above this image, the card reads: FIVE OF SWORDS. “You may feel as though you have been defeated, but you must not give in to despair. The battle may be over, but your struggle has not yet ended.” Misery catches in your throat. You want nothing more than for this nightmare to be over, but Anna’s words ring true: you know it will not end unless you put an end to it yourself.\n"
"A flash of light burns across the sky, followed swiftly by a resounding crack of thunder. The clouds above are not natural. Phantasmal shapes shift and churn within the mist above. If you listen closely, you can faintly hear their howls of pain and sadness drifting on the wind. “It has begun,” Anna utters quietly. You rise to your feet, ignoring your exhaustion, your pain, and your fear."

"你还没来得及回答，安娜就翻开了最近的一张塔罗牌。上面画著一个神秘的兜帽人，周围的地上插著五把剑。他俨然凯旋得胜，头顶酝酿著一团乌云，其他人则从他面前退缩、逃走。在图画上写著这张牌的名字：“宝剑五”。“你可能感觉自己已经被打败了，但干万不要因绝望而放弃。战争或许已经结束，但你仍需奋斗。“你喉头一阵苦涩。你只希望这场噩梦完结，但安娜说的听起来像是实话：你知道，只有你亲手将它终结，它才会结束。\n"
"一道闪电划破夜空，接著一道雷鸣轰然巨响。上空的乌云有异样。有幻影在上空云雾中移动、搅动。要是你仔细聆听，你可以隐约听到他们疼痛与悲伤的号叫声在风中飘荡。“已经开始了。”安娜平静地说道。你将自己的力竭、疼痛、恐惧抛在脑后，站起身来。"

msgid "Breaches and Incursions"
msgstr "裂口与入侵"

msgid "In this scenario, doom does not accrue at the usual rate. Instead, breaches—represented by resource tokens—are placed on locations. When enough breach tokens have been placed on a single location, an <b>incursion</b> occurs, which adds doom to that location and causes breaches to open in connecting locations. The investigators’ primary goal in this scenario should therefore be to prevent incursions from happening by removing breaches from locations. This can only be done using the abilities on each location."
msgstr "在本场冒险中，毁灭标记的增速与平常不同。会有以资源标记表示的裂口放置在地点上。当一个地点上放置了足够数量的裂口标记，发生一次<b>入侵</b>，在该地点上放置毁灭标记并导致裂口在其连接地点打开。因此，调查员在本场冒险的主要目标是通过移除地点上的裂口来防止入侵发生。只能通过使用每个地点的能力来达到该目标。"

msgid "Placing Breaches"
msgstr "放置裂口"

"Breaches are primarily placed on locations via the following ability on Agenda 1a: “<b>Forced</b> – When doom would be placed on this agenda: Instead, place 1 breach on a number of different random locations equal to 1 more than the number of investigators.” However, card effects can also place breaches directly on locations. \n"
"<i>For example: There are two investigators in the game, and it is the mythos phase. During the “place 1 doom on the current agenda” step of the mythos phase, instead of placing doom on Agenda 1a, the investigators must choose 3 different locations, at random. The locations randomly chosen are Southside, Rivertown, and French Hill. Therefore, 1 breach is placed on each of those locations.</i>\n"

"<i>示例：如果是2人游戏，且当前是神话阶段：在神话阶段的“在当前密谋卡上放置1个毁灭标记”步骤，调查员不在密谋1a上放置毁灭标记，改为调查员必须随机选择3个不同地点。随机选出的地点为南区、河岸城、法兰西山。因此，在这3个地点上各放置1个裂口。</i>\n"

To resolve an incursion at a location, perform the following steps, in order:"

"The spirit cackles as she hears your words, but her laughter is soon cut short. Emerging from the trees, the remainder of Anette’s coven–led by the red-haired witch Erynn–surround Anette wordlessly. Erynn gives you a solemn nod, her conviction showing through her stern demeanor. Understanding why they have come, you step aside and allow them to do their work.\n"
"One of the witches draws a circle in the dirt around Anette, while the rest bind her with tendrils of searing energy. The revenant shrieks and wails in agony, but the witches dare not cease. Finally, as their chants rise to a crescendo, Erynn pierces the sanctity of the circle with her knife, pressing firmly against the air and straining as though she were attempting to pierce solid stone. Keziah’s ghost departs in a whirl of spectral mist, dissipating into thin air with a final cry. Anette’s body, unsupported, collapses to the ground. “It’s over,” you say, placing a hand on Erynn’s shoulder.\n"
"“No,” she replies harshly, gesturing to the sky above. The storm clouds have all disappeared, yet you count not a single star in the night sky. The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not even realized it was there. How long had it loomed over the city while you spent your time warding against lesser incursions?\n"
"You ask what can be done to close a breach of such size. She clenches her jaw. “I don’t know. But I know who does.” She kneels over Anette, raises her hand, and slaps her hard across the face. Anette jerks awake, startled out of her catatonic state.\n"
"“Is this what you wanted, sister?” Erynn drags her to her feet, forcing her to look up at the catastrophe she has wrought.\n"
"“You know it isn’t,” Anette replies, her voice ragged. “I only wanted us all to have some semblance of the strength she possessed. I had no desire to use it in the same way she did. But the spirit took control, and I could not resist.” She lowers her head in resignation. “I’m sorry, sisters. I failed us all. I was not strong enough.”"

"那鬼魂听了你的话便笑了起来，但她的笑声很快便停止了。女巫集会残部从树林里现身，无声地围住安妮特身侧，领导着她们的是红发女巫伊琳。伊琳神色严肃地朝你点头致意，她坚定的态度表达了她的信念。你了解她们的来意后站到一旁，任她们动手。\n"
"其中一名女巫在安妮特周围的地上画了一个圈，其余的女巫则运起炽热的魔力，如触须一般将安妮特捆了起来。亡灵痛苦得尖叫、哀号，但女巫们却不敢停止。她们的咏唱声渐强，最后伊琳用她的尖刀刺向这个神圣的圆圈，刀子朝著空无一物的地方用力顶去，像是要刺穿坚石一般。凯夏的幽灵离开了安妮特的身体，化作一团鬼灵迷雾，伴随著最后一声尖叫，消失得无影无踪。安妮特的身体失去支撑，倒在地上。“已经结束了。”你一手放在伊琳的肩膀上说道。\n"
"“不。”她指向天空厉声答道。暴风雨的乌云已经全部消失，但夜空中依然一颗星星都看不见。地平线的边界勾勒出你头顶的虚空，那儿的裂口之大，让你之前甚至都没有意识到。这段时间你所防备的入侵比起它来都是小巫见大巫，它究竟笼罩了这座城市多久？\n"
"你问她要怎么做才能关闭如此巨大的裂口。她下颌紧绷：“我不知道。但我知道一个人，她知道办法。”她跪坐在安妮特身上，一巴掌狠狠地打在安妮特的脸上。安妮特从紧张木然的状态中猛地醒来。\n"
"“姐姐，这就是你要的吗？”伊琳把她拉了起来，强迫她抬头看自己一手酿造的大祸。\n"
"“这不是，你知道的。”安妮特声音颤抖著回答，“我只是想让我们每个人都分得她的力量。我无意像那幽灵一样运用力量作恶。但当时它主导了一切，我无力抗拒。”她无奈地垂下头来，“对不起，妹妹。我让大家失望了。是我当时还不够强大。”"

"You wouldn’t put it past the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge to lie about the consequences of your actions – after all, he has already deceived you more than once before. You ask him what he means when he says you will all be extinct. He grimaces and tells you to look outside.\n"
"The storm clouds have all disappeared, yet you count not a single star in the night sky. The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not even realized it was there.

"Sanford limps after you, peering up at the night sky. You ask what can be done to close a breach of such size, but before he can respond, coils of darkness emerge from the shadows, twisting into dark cloaks. In seconds you are surrounded by the witches of Anette’s coven. The high priestess steps forward, glaring at Carl Sanford with all of the intensity of hell itself.\n"
"“Do not trust the word of this sinister worm,” she warns you. “Everything he has done, he has done to further his own agenda. He would gladly hold the world hostage if it meant one last chance at power.”\n"
"Despite his wounds, Sanford rises to his feet and bellows back at her: “What hypocrisy! Do you forget that it was you and your misguided sect who started all of this? Summoning the dead, asking them for power?” He scoffs. “We would have elevated all of humanity. You sought only to elevate yourselves.” Sanford turns to appeal to your judgment one last time. “Do not be a fool,” he says quietly. “This outcome is not what the Lodge desires. Allow me to help, and together maybe we can return things to normal.”"
