"Onward and onward, your steed carries you into the inky nightmare of the void beyond. You dare not turn and look behind you, for you know that what you see will likely break your heart, or perhaps your mind. Great polypous horrors slide darkly amidst the blackness and loneliness of the cosmos. You had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it not ringing in your head this very moment.\n"
"There is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where you must go… The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."

"你的坐骑带你一路前进，进入了彼端的虚空，那漆黑的噩梦，你不敢回头望向身后，因为你知道，你看到的景象可能会击垮你的内心，或是瓦解你的思维。形如水螅一般的恐怖怪物在宇宙的黑暗与孤独中缓缓移动。你本想为这片瑰丽、闪烁的星空而惊叹，但等到依然浩瀚无垠的、黑暗而寒冷的宇宙映入你的眼帘，你只觉得自己腹中传来一阵空空荡荡的感觉。远远传来一段和弦，宇宙中的任何一种已知的乐器都无法重现这段旋律；要不是此时此刻在你的耳中响起，你也根本无法理解这段音符。\n"
"你们撞毁了挡路的骇人缟玛瑙塔楼，一阵强烈的气流随即伴著你们下降到一处极大的洞穴，其中是黑色石块和不可思议的建筑。随著你坚定地穿越一座不可思议的山谷，穿过成群的无形生物，穿过在黑暗中潜伏和舞动的存在，乐声越来越强。你无法不去听这奇怪的音乐，将每一个可怕的不谐音符都留在记忆里。人类无法想到或梦到你所在的地方，这里比地球诞生的时候更为久远。你只能寄望于你的坐骑，希望它能将你带到你必须要去的地方……阿撒托斯的王座。"

Then, put them into play along with facedown player cards from the top of the lead investigator’s deck, as depicted in “Location Placement for Setup / Act 1.” Facedown player cards represent empty space <i>(see “Empty Space”, below)</i>."
msgstr "拿取放在一边的“憎恶宫殿”和“宇宙”顶上的1张卡牌，将其混洗至无法分辨。然后，将这些卡牌与调查员队长牌堆顶上正面朝下的若干张玩家卡一同放置入场，如“冒险设置/场景1的参考摆放位置”所示。正面朝下的玩家卡表示虚空格子(详见“虚空格子”)。"

"Throughout this scenario, new locations will enter play from the top of the Cosmos, a separate deck consisting of double-sided locations. This is primarily done via the ability on each act: “[action] Spend X clues: Draw the top X cards of the Cosmos. Choose one to put into play using its connection instructions, and move to it. Shuffle the rest back into the Cosmos.”\n"
"The revealed side of each Cosmos location has a “<b>Cosmos</b> –” instruction which tells the investigator where to connect that location. (For example, “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect above” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately above the investigator’s location, whereas “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect to the right” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately to the right of the investigator’s location.)\n"
"A new location cannot enter play in a position already occupied by a location. If a location’s connection instructions are impossible to fulfill, shuffle that location back into the Cosmos and cancel the effects of the move.\n"
"“<b>Cosmos</b> –” instructions are only resolved when a location is being drawn from the Cosmos. When revealing a Cosmos location that is already in play, do not follow its “<b>Cosmos</b> –” instructions."

"宇宙牌堆是包含双面地点的一个单独牌堆，本场冒险期间会有新的地点从该牌堆顶上入场。地点主要通过每个场景的能力入场：“[action]花费X个线索：抽取‘宇宙’顶上的X张卡牌。选择其中一张卡牌，按照其‘<b>宇宙</b> – ’指示放置入场，移动到其上方。将其余卡牌洗回‘宇宙’。”\n"
"每个宇宙地点的已揭示面均有“<b>宇宙</b> – ”指示，告诉调查员该地点应该连接到什么地方。(例如，“<b>宇宙</b> – 与上方连接”意味著新抽出的地点应立即放在该调查员所在地点的上方，而“<b>宇宙</b> – 与右方连接”则意味著新抽出的地点应立即放在该调查员所在地点的右方。)\n"
"如果一个新地点将要放到已被另一地点占据的位置，那么该新地点不能入场。如果一个地点的“<b>宇宙</b> – ”指示不可能满足，将该地点洗回宇宙牌堆并取消该次抽取并放置地点的动作。\n"
"“<b>宇宙</b> – ”指示仅在从宇宙牌堆抽出一个地点时结算。在揭示已在场上的宇宙地点时，无需遵守其“<b>宇宙</b> – ”指示。"

"During this scenario, you will sometimes be instructed to place “empty space” into play. This is done by taking the top card of the active investigator’s deck and putting it into play facedown, in the indicated position. If there is no active investigator, the top card(s) of the lead investigator’s deck should be used, instead.\n"
"Empty space is not a location, and cannot be entered by enemies or investigators unless otherwise noted. It does, however, count as a location for the purposes of determining the distance between two locations.\n"
"A location can enter play in a position occupied by empty space. Should this happen, the empty space card is shuffled back into its owner’s deck."

"本场冒险期间，你有时会收到指示要放置“虚空格子”入场。收到上述指示时，你需要拿取当前调查员牌堆顶上的1张卡牌，将其正面朝下放置入场，放到图示位置。如果没有当前调查员，应改为拿取调查员队长牌堆顶的卡牌。\n"
"虚空格子不是地点，敌人或调查员不能进入，除非有特殊说明。但是，在计算两个地点的距离时将每个虚空格子作为一个地点计算。\n"
"新地点可以在一个已被虚空格子占据的位置入场。如果发生了这样的情况，将该虚空格子的卡牌洗回其所有者的牌堆。"

Nebulae collapse and become stars. New worlds are forged, and new beings evolve to inhabit them. Inevitably, one learns of Azathoth. Its worship grows. In the end, all will succumb to madness or join you in oblivion… For in the grand scheme of fate, we are but specks of dust adrift in the aether, living only by the whim of an uncaring cosmos."

"It was not until recently that you understood the purpose of the awful piping which you have heard constantly throughout your investigation. It is a lullaby of sorts, meant to keep the oblivious god from waking. For just a brief moment, the pipers’ song was interrupted, and Azathoth began to stir. Now you understand why Anna came to you that fateful night and begged to read your fortune. She knew the part you would have to play when you arrived here.\n"

msgid "You refuse to allow this creature to destroy everything you have ever loved. You gather together what you need for your ritual—a bit of shadowy essence from the witches’ cloaks, a fragment of spectral mist from the wraiths you banished, and the knowledge you’ve gained from delving into Arkham’s past. Slowly, quietly, you weave your wall together, stitching darkness with blood, blood with souls, souls with onyx stone. It takes ages to complete. When you are done, your reward is oblivion. A stillness and silence so pure, so perfect, no disturbance can penetrate it. The barrier cannot hold Azathoth—nothing truly can—but perhaps now it will not stir when fools on Earth call forth its name or draw from its power. With your task complete, you turn and face the darkness, summoning your steed. It is time to go home."

A quill appears in your hands as you open the tome, and a voice from beyond reaches your ears. “Sign it with your blood. Take a new secret name, and your desire shall become truth.
