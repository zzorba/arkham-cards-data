"The upstairs study of the Silver Twilight Lodge is cozy, if a little cramped. The floor is covered in a plush carpet, and several comfortable sofas and small round tables fill the warmly lit room. Portraits of world-weary Lodge members line the walls around you. Carl Sanford, president of the Lodge, sits across from you, idly swirling a glass of Merlot in his wrinkled hand.\n"
"“The Silver Twilight Lodge pursues knowledge that can help us elevate our understanding of the universe,” Mr. Sanford explains, pausing to take a sip from his wine. “The creature you encountered in Josef Meiger’s estate—its appearance is not the only peculiar happening in Arkham as of late. Tell me: have you experienced anything else recently that might be connected to these events?”"

"楼上的书房虽然稍显局促，但却很舒适。在这间温暖的房间里，地板上铺著一块绒毛地毯，还摆著几张舒适的沙发和一张小圆桌。你周围的墙上挂著一排肖像，是厌世的秘社成员。秘社的会长卡尔·桑福德坐在你对面，皱巴巴的手里悠闲地转著一杯梅洛葡萄酒。\n"
"“银暮秘社追求的知识，能够提高我们对于宇宙的理解，”桑福德解释说，停下来小酌一口：“你在约瑟夫·梅吉尔的庄园遇到的那只怪物——它的出现不是阿卡姆最近发生的唯一一件怪事。告诉我：你最近经历的事情中，有没有可能与这几起事件有关的？”"

"You tell Mr. Sanford about your experience last week—waking up in the middle of the woods, the strange mist that weaved throughout the trees, the witches and their spell. He leans forward and listens intently as you explain the night’s strange events, your memories still somewhat of a haze. You conclude your story, and the elderly man considers your words. “Interesting,” he says at last. “I know of this coven. They are led by a witch named Anette Mason. Their magic is no trivial thing. They have passed down arcane secrets that can manipulate the energies of the universe. It is dangerous knowledge they possess—knowledge I believe they derived from a powerful witch who fled from Salem over two hundred years ago. Does the name ‘Keziah’ mean anything to you?”\n"
"You nod. Everyone in Arkham has at least some passing knowledge of the witch whose ghost supposedly haunts the old condemned “Witch House” in French Hill. Most believe her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the decrepit house. Mr. Sanford’s steely gaze and humorless tone makes it clear to you that this is not the case. “Perhaps this Anette is a true descendant of Keziah, or perhaps she is simply using her name. In any event, I believe these events are connected. To that end, I have a task for you, on behalf of the Silver Twilight Lodge.” Carl Sanford rises to his feet, using his cane more for show than for balance. You rise as well, ready to perform whatever duties are necessary to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n"
"“We need as much information about this coven as we can obtain. If there is any place that will have these answers, it is the house where Keziah herself lived all those years ago.” You nod in agreement—there are too many questions you need answered. What spell were the witches casting that night in the woods? What is their motive? And what is their connection to the creature that kidnapped those four unfortunate souls? You shake Mr. Sanford’s hand and depart for the Witch House."

"你告诉桑福德你上周的经历——在树林里醒来、树林里弥漫著的怪雾、女巫和她们的法术。你说到那天夜里发生的怪事时，你的记忆仍然有些模糊，他俯身专心聆听。你说完之后，这位老人思考你说的话。“有趣。”最后他说道，“我知道这个集会。领导者是一位名叫安妮特·梅森的女巫。她们的魔法可不是闹著玩的，她们所传承的奥秘能够操控宇宙的力量。这是一种危险的知识——我相信这源于两百多年前从塞勒姆逃出来的强大女巫。你听过“凯夏”这个名字吗？\n"
"你点点头。阿卡姆的每一个人多少都对那位女巫有所了解，据说她的幽灵常常在法兰西山的“巫宅”出没。大多数人觉得她是虚构的；一个为了让小孩子远离那幢老房子而编出来的故事。桑福德先生冷冰冰的视线和毫无幽默感的语气，让你清楚地认识到事实并非如此。“安妮特可能是凯夏真正的后裔，或者她可能只是借用了凯夏的名头。无论如何，我相信这些事件之间是有关联的。为此，我代表银暮秘社交给你一个任务。”卡尔·桑福德站起身来，他的手杖更像是用来炫耀的，而不是用来保持平衡。你也站了起来，不论任务是什么，你势在必行，定要把这谜团弄个水落石出。\n"
"“我们需要知道更多关于女巫集会的信息。你要找的答案，一定就在凯夏多年前居住的那幢小屋里。”你点头表示同意——你心中有太多的问题需要答案。那晚女巫们在树林里施放的是什么法术？她们的目的是什么？和绑走四个可怜人的怪物有什么关系？你与桑福德握手，出发前往巫宅。"

"You shake your head. You’re not sure if the events that took place in the woods are connected, or if they even really happened—some part of you still believes it was all a strange dream. Mr. Sanford examines you with a cold, piercing glare. You get the feeling that he is looking directly through you. “Very well,” he says. “Out of curiosity, does the name ‘Keziah Mason’ mean anything to you?”\n"
"You nod. Everyone in Arkham has at least some passing knowledge of the witch whose ghost supposedly haunts the old condemned “Witch House” in French Hill. Most believe her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the decrepit house. Mr. Sanford’s steely gaze and humorless tone makes it clear to you that this is not the case. He motions to an old, worn tome which lies on the table in front of you, open to a page filled with strange inscriptions and arcane glyphs. “I believe the creature you encountered in Josef ’s manor is tied to Keziah and the secret knowledge she possessed. See for yourself.” You pick up the tome and examine the markings on the page closely."

"你摇摇头。你不确定树林里发生的事情是否有关，也不确定它是不是真实发生的——你心底里仍然觉得那一切不过是场怪梦。桑福德用冰冷而锐利的目光审视你。你感觉他看穿了你的一切。“好的。”他说道，“好奇问一句，你听过‘凯夏·梅森’这个名字吗？”\n"

"After your confrontation with the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge, you travel to the manor of the Arkham Historical Society in Southside. You are positive that the events you experienced in the woods last week have something to do with the creature that kidnapped those four unfortunate souls. It’s just a hunch—a feeling that crawls along the back of your neck, imploring you to look away—but you’re sure that everything is connected. You’re just not sure how.\n"
"As you enter, one of the Historical Society’s many researchers greets you and asks if she can help in any way. You give a cursory description of the information you’re looking for; just enough that she can direct you where to look, but vague enough to leave your motives at the door. “I don’t know why you are researching such morbid affairs, but the records you are looking for should be in the library on the third floor,” the researcher says.\n"
"You thank her and head to the third floor, where you begin to study the history of witchcraft in Arkham. In the late 17th century, Arkham was one of the New England towns caught up in the hysteria of witch trials. Accusations of witchcraft spread like wildfire, and many of the accused were executed by hanging or burning, guilty and innocent alike. But there was one witch whose infamy rose above the rest, and whose mystical power was never in question: Keziah Mason.\n"
"You recognize the name as the ghost who supposedly haunts the old Witch House in French Hill. You had always thought her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the condemned house. But the Historical Society’s records indicate that Keziah was a real person: a powerful witch who had fled from Salem over two hundred years ago.\n"

"你进入时，历史协会的其中一名研究员向你问好，询问你是否需要她的帮助。你粗略地说明要找的信息，详细程度刚刚好能让她告诉你到哪查找，避免暴露你的动机。“我不知道你为什么在调查这么恐怖的事情，但你要找的资料应该在图书馆的三楼。”研究员说道。\n"
"你向她道谢，往三楼走去，开始研究巫术在阿卡姆的历史。在17世纪末，阿卡姆跟其他新英格兰城市一样，陷入了女巫审判的狂潮。有关巫术的罪名如同野火一般蔓延，许多被冠上罪名的人被判以绞刑或火刑，不论是否无辜，一概论处。但有一个女巫，污名远超众人，拥有毋庸置疑的神秘力量：凯夏·梅森。\n"

"You pin the newspaper article up on your wall along with the rest of the evidence you’ve found. Whatever is happening in Josef Meiger’s manor, it’s getting out of hand. First, there were the four disappearances on the twenty-second, at the Silver Twilight Lodge’s annual charity gala. Now more have gone missing after a second event at the same estate. Is the Lodge somehow involved? Why else would they move this dinner to Mr. Meiger’s estate?\n"

You had always thought her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the condemned house.
