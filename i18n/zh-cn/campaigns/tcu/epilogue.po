"“Gone? What do you mean she’s gone?!” Sheriff Engle demands.\n"
"“See for yourself,” the officer replies. He guides the sheriff through a long hallway flanked by holding cells. “She was guarded at all hours, trust me. One moment she was there, the next…” He stops in front of Anette’s cell, and watches as Sheriff Engle’s jaw drops. Smeared along the walls of the cell is a sticky red substance, painted in a delicate pattern. The woman is nowhere to be seen."

"“逃走了？‘她逃走了’是什么意思？！”警长恩格尔质问道。\n"
"“你自己看吧。”警员回答。他领著警长走过一条长长的走廊，两侧都是牢房。“她二十四小时都有人看守，相信我。上一秒她还在这儿，但下一秒……”他停在安妮特的牢房门前，看著警长恩格尔惊讶地张开了嘴巴。牢房墙壁上涂抹了一种粘稠的红色物质，描绘出精致的图案。那个女人不见了。"

msgid "You nod to the knight as he places the file you had requested onto your hardwood desk. Finding all of Carl Sanford’s records hadn’t been easy, but now all of the secrets of the Order were within your grasp. “What is the next step?” he asks, eager to serve. You inform him that there is to be a meeting in the sanctum this very night. “Very well. I will summon our most loyal members.” You dismiss him and turn to look out the window of your new office. The city of Arkham is as grim and moody as ever…but at least now you can protect it from the forces that lay beyond the Earth."
msgstr "骑士将你要求的文件放在你的硬木桌上，你朝他点头致意。要找出卡尔·桑福德的所有记录并不是件易事，但现在修道会的一切秘密都在你掌握之中。“下一步是什么？”他急于为你效力，问道。你告诉他，今晚要在圣堂召开一场会议。“好的。我会召集我们最忠心的成员。”你让他退下，随后转身望向你新办公室的窗外。阿卡姆城一如既往的冷酷、阴郁……但至少现在这座城的秘密掌握在你手中。"

"Anna regards you calmly as you enter. As always, her prescience is disconcerting, but by now you have gotten used to it. “I’ve been expecting you for some time,” she admits. “I suppose you have questions for me. Very well. Ask away. Though I imagine that by now you must know the answer.” She neither offers you a seat nor a drink. You begin to describe your situation, though the truth of your condition is plain to see for somebody with her gifts (and few else). You had hoped for another explanation— any explanation at all—but it was only a desperate clinging to hope, without justification. Anna gives you a pitying grimace and shakes her head. “Surely by now you must understand. You have completed your task. Your business here has concluded. Now is the time for you to rest and be at peace.”\n"
"Peace? No, you cannot be at peace! There is still so much left for you to do…!"

"你进来时，安娜平静地看著你。一如往常，她的预见令人不安，但你已经习惯了。“我等了你好一会了。”她坦承地说，“我猜你有问题要问我。好，问吧。但我想你现在已经知道答案了。”她既不请你坐下，也不给你倒杯喝的。你开始描述你的情况，尽管某人能够凭藉她的天赋(或是别的东西)，一眼洞穿实情。你曾希望能得到另一种解释——不管是什么解释——你极度渴求希望，甚至不需要理由。安娜露出遗憾的神情，摇摇头：“现在你得明白，你已经完成了自己的任务。你要做的事情已经完成了，是时候该休息了，安息吧。”\n"
"安息？不，你不能安息！你还有很多事情要做……！"

msgid "In your dream, a tall man approaches. His grin is full of malice. “It is time to pay your due,” he announces. “You got what you wanted. Now it is my turn.”"
msgstr "一名高挑的男子来到你的梦境之中。他的笑容充满恶意。“你欠下的东西，是时候该还了。”他说道，“你得到了你想要的东西。现在该我了。”"

"No matter what you do, the creature’s assault on your mind never ceases. Its gaze haunts you everywhere you look. It controls your every thought—your hopes, your bonds, your fears, your ambitions. A reminder of your futile existence. Each night, you toss and turn, unable to wrench free from this sensation of worthlessness. Your thoughts turn to a grim, uncertain future. A future without life. A future without <i>you</i>. It is the one ordeal every mortal must endure, and yet the one experience no mortal could possibly describe. Ghosts? Realms beyond our mortal coil? Nothing but a last resort for a mind desperate to cling to life.\n"
"When the creature next invades, you have come to a new conclusion. An icy draft surrounds you as the thing coalesces before you. Your throat constricts and tears well in your eyes, but you stand tall. You are unafraid. The creature gazes at you curiously, and the piping of infernal flutes fades into silence. It extends its clawed hand, and you shake it. You will never truly be free from its grasp, but perhaps you and the creature can work in agreement. Perhaps you can tame your fear. It doesn’t matter if the world has no point. It’s yours, damnit, and nothing will stop you from altering it to your liking."

"无论你做什么，这怪物都会无休止地折磨著你的意志。不论你的目光转向何处，你总能看见它凝视著你。它控制著你的所思所想——你的希望、你的牵绊、你的恐惧、你的野心。它提醒著你，你的存在毫无意义。你感到自己一文不值，每个夜晚你辗转反侧，无法摆脱这种感觉。你的思想指引你走向一个糟糕的、不确定的未来。那里没有生命。也没有你。这是每一个凡人都必须遭受的苦难，但没有一个凡人有机会描述这段经历。幽灵？超然尘世之外的领域？对于一个渴望得到生命的意识体来说，这就是最后的办法。\n"
"当那怪物再次来袭，你迎来了一个新的结局。你面前的东西融合在一起，一股冰冷的气流包围了你。你喉咙发紧，眼里盈满泪水，但你挺直了腰杆。你不害怕。怪物好奇地盯著你，旋即地狱般的笛声消失了，归于寂静。它伸出一只带有爪子的手，你将其握住。你永远不可能真正摆脱它的掌控，但或许你能与它达成一致。或许你能克服你的恐惧。哪怕这个世界不再具有任何意义，也没有关系。世界就是属于你的，管他呢，没有什么能够阻止你将它改变成你喜欢的样子。"

"“You’re a fool,” Carl Sanford says from behind bars, his tone confident. “How long do you expect this to stand?”\n"
"You know he is right. The charges brought against Sanford are flimsy at best. No judge or jury is going to believe any story about dark rituals and eldritch beings. Even if you could convince others of Sanford’s dangerous ideologies, his considerable influence and political clout ensures he’ll be released sooner than you would like. Even so, you had to separate him from his lackeys while you cleaned up his mess. You tell Sanford that you’ll be keeping an eye on him once he is out.\n"
"“And I, you,” he retorts."

"“你真蠢，”卡尔·桑福德在监牢里说道，语气充满自信。“你觉得这种情况会持续多久？”\n"
"你知道他是对的。对桑福德的指控充其量十分薄弱。没有法官或陪审团会相信任何关于黑暗仪式和恐怖生物的故事。即使你能说服其他人相信桑福德危险的思想，他巨大的影响力和政治权势也能确保他比你预期的更早被释放。即便如此，你还是得把他和他的手下分开，以便收拾他的烂摊子。你告诉桑福德，就算他放出去，你也会盯著他。\n"
"“彼此彼此，”他回道。"

"A cold wind blows through the silent woods, the clearing bathed in a silver glow bestowed by the full moon. “We have new blood joining our circle,” Erynn states from the center of the clearing, where Anette once stood to lead her sisters. She beckons you forward. “Our coven is bound by much more than simple association. We are a family. And we are proud to welcome you into our midst.”\n"
"With your new understanding of the universe and the forces that hold it together, you promise to use your knowledge only to maintain the balance of the world. Erynn and the others nod in agreement.\n"
"“This city is already stained with much blood,” she says. “Spilling more is not an act of cleansing. Let us be shields, and blades of vengeance no longer.”"

"冷风吹过寂静的树林，满月的银色光芒洒在空地上。“有新血加入我们的圈子，”伊琳站在空地中央说道，那里原先是安妮特领导她的姐妹们的位置。她示意你前进。“我们的羁绊不仅仅是简单的集会，我们是一家人。我们很荣幸地欢迎你加入我们。”\n"
"你对宇宙和维系宇宙的力量已经有了新的认识，你承诺只会用你的知识来维持世界的平衡。伊琳与其他人点头同意。\n"
"“这座城市已经沾满了鲜血，”她说道。“再洒更多的血并不能清洗。让我们作为盾牌来守护，不再成为复仇的刀刃。”"
