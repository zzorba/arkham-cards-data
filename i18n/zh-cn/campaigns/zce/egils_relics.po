"Egil knew no greater loss than the death of his sons, Gunnar and Bodvar. Determined to starve and follow them into darkness, Egil sequestered himself into his room in Borg. His daughter Thorgerd tricked him to break his fast with a horn of milk he mistook for water. In his anguish he chomped off part of the horn with his teeth, and resolved to honor his sons in verse.\n"

"At the Battle of Brunanbur, Egil and Thorolf helped turn the tide for King Athelstan. Unfortunately, the King's order to have Thorolf command his own force separate from Egil led to his untimely death, being exhausted from a berserk rage the day before. Thorolf was always the light to Egil's dark, and in a moment, that light was extinguished.\n"

"After slaying both Berg-Onund and King Eirik's son, Rognvald, Egil's fury would not abate. In accordance with runic tradition, he proclaimed a nithing, or a curse, upon Eirik's lands and all of the spirits of Norway. He carved the runes into a maple pole, affixed the head of a horse, and planted it firmly in Norwegian soil. Egil had a seemingly endless capacity for spite that only sharpened his sense of honor.\n"
