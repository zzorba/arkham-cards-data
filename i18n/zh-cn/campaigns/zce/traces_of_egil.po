"Nothing could slake Egil's thirst at the banquet. He cursed his host, Bard of Atley, who had withheld the ale for the arrival of King Eirik and his retinue. In response, Queen Gunnhild plotted with Bard to poison Egil's next drink, but was foiled when he sliced open his hand and wrote magic runes on the horn in his own blood:\n"
"<blockquote>Write we runes around the horn,\n"
"Redden all the spell with blood;\n"
"Wise words choose I for the cup\n"
"Wrought from branching horn of beast.\n"
"Drink we then, as drink we will,\n"
"Draught that cheerful bearer brings,\n"
"Learn that health abides in ale,\n"
"Holy ale that Bard hath bless'd.</blockquote>\n"
"The poisoned horn shattered in the ale maid's hands, and Egil ran Bard through the middle with his sword."

"At the age of 90, a blind Egil sat at home in Mosfell, feet by the fire, when he was struck by an idea:\n"
"\"I mean to take with me to the Thing two chests that King Athelstan gave me, each of which is full of English silver. I mean to have these chests carried to the Hill of Laws just when it is most crowded. Then I mean to sow broadcast the silver, and I shall be surprized if all share it fairly between them. Kicks, I fancy, there will be and blows; nay, it may end in a general fight of all the assembled Thing.\"\n"
"Too frail to attend himself, Egil had the silver buried, then murdered the slaves he hired to ensure it never be found."

"Thorfinn's daughter, Helga, had complained of pining sickness. She could not sleep and she was getting weaker by the day. Egil decided to try his hand. Inspecting the bed, he discovered a whalebone carved with a set of ineffectual runes. He shaved them off into the fire and inscribed his own. Egil proclaimed:\n"
"<blockquote>Runes none should grave ever\n"
"Who knows not to read them;\n"
"Of dark spell full many\n"
"The meaning may miss.\n"
"Ten spell-words writ wrongly\n"
"On whale-bone were graven:\n"
"Whence to leek-tending maiden,\n"
"Long sorrow and pain.</blockquote>\n"
"Helga arose from where she fitfully lay to wonder at her sudden shift in mood. While still weak, she would shortly recover."

"Egil's rage could not be contained, even as a small child. After being bullied by an older boy named Grim, Egil resolved to have vengenace. With a halberd given to him by Thord, he returned and drove the blade into Grim's skull, piercing his brain. That night, Egil penned this poem requesting his family procure a ship so as to begin his Viking career:\n"
"<blockquote>Thus counselled my mother,\n"
"For me should they purchase\n"
"A galley and good oars\n"
"To go forth a-roving.\n"

"Hold course for the haven,\n"
"Hew down many foemen.</blockquote>\n"
"Egil would set sail only a few years later."
