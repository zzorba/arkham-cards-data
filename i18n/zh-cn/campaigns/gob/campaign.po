msgid "While not an official variant, some people like to play the two scenarios included in the Guardians of the Abyss expansion as a two scenario mini-campaign. Because this is an unofficial variant, note that you might want to utilize standalone deckbuilding rules, since the product was intended to be played with decks with some amount of XP."
msgstr "尽管官方无此变体，但一些人喜欢将深渊守卫扩充(含两场冒险)当作一个包含两场冒险的迷你剧本。因为这是一种非官方变体的玩法，且此扩充原本是设计给已经取得一些经验的牌组来进行，你也许会想采用独立扩充包的牌组构建规则(以降低难度)。"
