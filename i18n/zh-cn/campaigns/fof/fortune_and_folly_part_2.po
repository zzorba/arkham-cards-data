msgid "Only a few hours remain until the heist begins. Isamara paces nervously in front of you before taking a deep breath to calm her nerves. She steps forward to the table where a map of the casino is displayed. With one hand, she gestures toward it. \"I m still not sure exactly how you're going to pull this off, but this is what I know...\""
msgstr "离开始行动只剩几个小时。伊萨玛拉焦急的来回踱步，不断深呼吸来缓解自己的紧张。她走到展示著赌场平面图的桌边，用一只手指著它说：“我还是不确定你要怎么让计划成功，但我会尽力告诉你我所知的东西……”"

msgid "Together with Isamara, you examine the relic that was the source of all this trouble. Sometimes it looks just like an ordinary coin, albeit an incredibly ancient one from some long forgotten civilization. At other times, however, the air around it distorts and warps. You also know now from experience the ways in which it can make the seemingly impossible all too real. For the first time, you see a genuine smile on Isamara's face. \"I have to thank you for this. For getting it out of Abarran's hands. And getting it away from this place. I don't know what would have happened if you didn't. Tonight was bad enough, but nothing would have stopped Abarran from holding tight to his prize, no matter how many died along the way.\" You begin to gather your things, as Isamara does the same. You know that you will need to leave Monte Carlo immediately, as any of the Fortune's Chosen who have survived, including Abarran himself, will hunt for you and the Wellspring. \"I saw him one last time, before we escaped,\" Isamara explains, \"The look of rage in his eyes... Without his precious artifact he'll be even more unstable.\" You tell her that maybe he is the one that should be scared instead. After all, she successfully orchestrated his downfall from within. At your words, that same smile crosses her face once more. \"I could get used to that idea.\" With everything ready to go and the Wellspring in hand, you leave Monte Carlo behind, hoping your luck will hold."
msgstr "你跟伊萨玛拉一起检视著这个遗物，一切麻烦的源头。有时候它看起来就只是普通的钱币，来自某个远古以前、早已被遗忘的文明。但在某些时刻，它周遭的空气中会出现扭曲或模糊的状况。现在你从过往的经验中得知它的确具有将不可能化为可能的力量。伊萨玛拉笑著说，这是你第一次看到她露出真心的笑容：“我得谢谢你，将它从阿巴兰的魔掌中拿走，并带离这个地方。我不知道如果你失败的话会发生什么事，今晚已经够糟了，但如果让阿巴兰继续持有它的话，不管有多少人受害，他都不会停止使用这股力量。”你跟伊萨玛拉开始收拾自己的东西，你们知道自己必须立刻离开蒙特卡罗，因为任何还存活的时运之子，包括阿巴兰自己，都会为了时运泉源猎杀你们。“我在逃离前看到他最后一眼。”伊萨马拉说道，“他的双眼中充满了愤怒……失去他的宝贝必定会让他变得更不稳定。”你告诉她，或许阿巴兰才是该感到害怕的人，毕竟她在他的眼皮子底下策划一切，还亲手让他垮台。伊萨玛拉听到这又再度露出真挚的笑容：“我喜欢这个想法。”一切都准备好后，你带著泉源离开蒙特卡罗，希望幸运始终眷顾你。"

msgid "By all accounts, escaping from the clutches of those horrible creatures and an army of casino staff and security could be called a successful night. Yet the Wellspring, the whole purpose for this ill-fated heist, has eluded your grasp. In the days that follow, you wonder if you are courageous or mad enough to try again, but the casino never reopens its doors and there is no further sign of Abarran or the Fortune's Chosen. The newspapers are strangely muted regarding the night's events, making no mention of the fantastical monsters that terrorized casino patrons. More than ever, it seems that some person or group helped Abarran set up his operation here and is protecting him after the fact as well. More importantly, after your attempted heist and the strange dimensional incursion, Abarran has taken the Wellspring somewhere far from here. It is possible that you could track him down and find some other way to obtain the relic, but for now, there are no leads and no sign of where he may have gone. You leave Monte Carlo, licking your wounds and wondering if you will have the fortune, or misfortune, of running into Abarran and the Wellspring again one day."
msgstr "不管怎么样，能从那些可怕的生物跟赌场人员手中逃出生天，已经是一场胜利了。虽然这场命运多舛的劫案原本的目标——时运泉源从你的指缝间溜走了。接下来几天，你考虑著自己是否有足够的勇气——或疯狂，来再度尝试。但赌场的大门保持紧闭，从未再打开过，也没有阿巴兰跟时运之子的消息。报纸也出奇的沉默，没有任何关于当天晚上的报导，没有提到那些造成赌客们惊恐万分的怪物。看来真的有些人在协助阿巴兰并掩盖他的所作所为，防止真相被揭露。更重要的是，由于你的介入，还有奇怪的异次元干扰，阿巴兰似乎不得不将泉源转移，离开这里。你也许可以追踪他，并找到其他方式取得那个遗物。但眼下无线索可循，你无法得知他去了哪里。你离开蒙特卡罗，照料自己的伤口，想著也许有一天你会幸运的——或不幸的，再度遇上阿巴兰跟泉源。"

msgid "When you come to consciousness some me later, you are struck first by the absolute quiet. As you rise to your feet, the casino is completely empty. No cultists. No monsters. No patrons. Not a single soul to be seen. And it doesn't take much to realize that the relic you sought is long gone too. You stumble out into the daylight to find the city going about its business, as if nothing untoward had taken place. In the days that follow, the casino closes its doors for good. There is no further sign of Abarran or the Fortune's Chosen. You leave Monte Carlo, nursing your wounds and wondering if you will have the fortune, or misfortune, of running into Abarran and the Wellspring again one day."
msgstr "当你恢复意识时，全然的寂静像当头棒喝般袭来。你站起身，发现赌场已经一片空荡，没有邪教徒、没有怪物，也没有赌客，没有任何有生命的东西还留在这。你很快也发现你追寻的遗物也消失了。你步履蹒跚的踏进阳光中，发现城市依然照常运转著，就像什么事都没发生过一样。接下来几天，赌场大门深锁，似乎已永久停业，也没有任何阿巴兰跟时运之子的踪迹。你离开蒙特卡罗，照料自己的伤口，想著也许有一天你会幸运的——或不幸的，再度遇上阿巴兰跟泉源。"
