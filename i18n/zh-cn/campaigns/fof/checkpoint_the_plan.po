msgid "With the stakeout completed, the time has come to plan out the actual heist. There are only a few days until Saturday night at Défis de la Roulette, the busiest night of the week and the perfect time to get lost in a crowd. The plan for the heist is simple, at least in theory. With the casino staff and security occupied by the Saturday crowd, you will first enter the public areas, just as you did last time. There, you will try to avoid notice as much as you can while completing any needed tasks. Once that's done, you will slip into the restricted areas in the back of the casino that are reserved for staff. This area holds the vault itself, where the Wellspring of Fortune is located. According to Isamara, the vault door is not only secured by solid steel, but also held shut by some kind of energy. If that wasn't enough, it is constantly monitored by guards, patrols, and the cultists of the Fortune's Chosen. It will take a carefully executed plan, and some improvisation, to succeed against all odds. With only a short time to gather supplies and practice the approach, there may not be enough time to rest and recuperate from your first tangle with the casino."
msgstr "你完成了准备工作，是时候进行真正的劫案了。离周六只剩几天，那是轮盘挑战一周中最忙碌的时候，很适合在人潮的掩护下消失。计划很简单，至少理论上是这样。当赌场员工跟保全被周六的人潮忙得焦头烂额时，你首先会进入开放区域，就像上次一样。接著在避免引起注意的状况下完成所需的任务。完成后你就能溜进禁止进入的员工区域，也就是金库的所在位置，时运泉源就锁在里面。据伊萨玛拉所说，金库大门不只是厚重的钢铁，还有某种能量保持其封闭。棘手的还不止这个，守卫会全天候监视著大门，还可能遇上巡逻队或时运之子。你必须非常小心的执行计划，并随机应变，才能克服所有困难。所剩的时间不多，你必须找齐装备、进行演练。在你与赌场正面交锋前没多少时间可以休息了。"
