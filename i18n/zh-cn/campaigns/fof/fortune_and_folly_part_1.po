msgid "MAN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING TWICE MINUTES AFTER WINNING BIG! This sensational headline is what first grabbed your attention. You might have written it off as just an extraordinary and unlikely event exaggerated to sell papers, if it weren't for the other stories that followed, all centering around the same place: a casino in Monte Carlo called Défis de la Roulette. In addition to the unlucky patron being struck down mere moments after leaving the casino with his winnings, others have also met grisly yet improbable fates either within or nearby. Upon inquiring further, it seems that this casino appeared quickly and unexpectedly, and the authorities in Monaco have been suspiciously tight-lipped about where exactly it came from and who owns it. Since its opening, the casino has been a magnet for the unnatural and implausible. The more you learn, the more it seems worth at least taking a look to determine whether these events are simply coincidence, or the result of something much more sinister."
msgstr "两道闪电击中大奖赢家！这个耸动的标题是第一篇引起你注意的报导，你一开始认为这只是记者为了吸引读者而夸大的事件。但在短时间内，几个类似的事件接连发生，而且全都围绕著同个地点：蒙特卡罗一座名为轮盘挑战的赌场。不只是那些满载而归的赌客，血腥的厄运也降临在赌场中或附近地区的民众身上。在深入调查后，你发现这座赌场崛起的非常突然而快速，更可疑的是，摩纳哥政府当局对于赌场的来历跟经营者的资讯守口如瓶。自从赌场开幕，这里似乎吸引了许多超自然跟无法解释的事件。你越深入调查，越确定自己必须走一趟，亲眼确认这些事件是诡异的巧合；还是背后藏有更大的阴谋。"

msgid "Your cell has been given the name of a contact at Défis de la Roulette: Isamara Ordoñez. Isamara is not just an employee there, she is the \"Flor de Nicaragua,\" a singer whose performances have become a major draw for the casino. She has repeatedly reached out to various parties for help over the course of the past month, concerned with some of the events she has witnessed behind the scenes. The Foundation has reason to believe a Key may be involved in these strange events. You find a table in the casino lounge, and wait for an opportune moment to attract her attention. Only a few minutes later, a woman in a striking red dress takes the stage. Her performance is so captivating that she is already leaving the stage before you remember why you are here. There is no doubt that she is the one you are looking for. As she glances at the crowd, you give a small wave. At first, she appears to take little notice, but then her eyes fall to the flower that you were told to wear. She approaches your table and sits down. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"If you were sent by Them, its not safe to talk here. Meet me in an hour.\" She hands you a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance!\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. Hope to see you again soon!\""
msgstr "你取得了一个名字：伊萨玛拉·奥多涅斯，她是你在轮盘挑战中的联络人。伊萨玛拉不是普通员工，她是被称为“尼加拉瓜之花”的歌手，她的表演是赌场的主要卖点。据说她在过去几个月秘密帮助了几个想调查这些奇异事件的组织，她对于自己在幕后目击到的一些事件非常担忧。根据目前掌握的情报，基石相信这些超自然事件背后有密钥的力量作祟。你在赌场交谊厅的一张空桌坐下，等待引起她注意的时机。几分钟后，一名女子身穿一袭令人惊艳的红色礼服走上舞台，她的表演摄人心魄，一直到她走下舞台，你才重新想起自己前来的原因。毫无疑问，她就是你要找的人。当她扫视人群时，你向她低调的挥手。一开始她似乎并没有注意，但接著她看见了你配戴的花，这是你们约定好的暗号。她走到你的桌子旁坐下，脸上挂著轻松的微笑，但话语却紧绷而尖锐：“这里不安全，一个小时后跟我碰面。”她将一张卡片塞进你手中，上面写著附近一间咖啡厅的地址。她随即起身，抚平礼服上的皱褶。“谢谢各位的赞美！”她向所有观众说，“希望很快能再相见！”"

msgid "Although you ask around town about the casino for several days, promising leads seem to be scarce. When you visit the casino itself, nothing appears out of place, although your probing questions don't go entirely unnoticed. As you sit in the casino lounge, assessing whether the trip to Monte Carlo was a complete waste of time and if nothing is amiss here after all, a woman in a striking red dress sits down at your table. You recognize her as Isamara Ordoñez, the singer who had performed just moments before, capturing the audience with her hauntingly beautiful voice. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"You're being too careless. We can't talk here. If you want to know the truth, meet me in an hour.\" She hands vou a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance,\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. \"Hope to see you again soon!\""

"Isamara is wearing a long overcoat of the darkest blue when you meet, her wavy brown hair partially hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Clearly, she is worried about someone recognizing her. \"You're right to be suspicious about what's happening at Défis,\" she begins, wasting no time with pleasantries. \"On the surface, it's a casino like any other. But there's more going on than anyone could guess, Behind the scenes, a cult called the Fortune's Chosen are the ones that really run the show. They are deadly and dangerous. Anyone who has gotten too close to the truth or crossed the casino in some way has met a horrible fate.\"\n"
"You ask about the casino owner, and how involved he is with this cult. Isamara gives a mirthless smile. \"Abarran? He is their leader. Not just that, he is the worst of them all. He brought the casino here, but more importantly, he brought the Wellspring.\"\n"
"Isamara explains that the vault of the casino holds a strange and powerful relic of mysterious origin. It is this relic that is responsible for the unlikely events that seem to pop up around the casino. This item is known as the Wellspring of Fortune, and it has the power to manipulate probability and luck. Abarran guards it jealously, as whoever possesses the Wellspring is able to turn fortune to their cause, no matter how selfish and destructive that cause may be. Over time, he has created the loyal cadre of the Fortune's Chosen by granting them some measure of the benefits of the Wellspring. They have come to revere it almost as a god. These true believers can be easily distinguished from the regular casino employees by the distinctive coin medallions they wear around their necks. \"Abarran trusts me for some reason, and he's even offered me to join. I think he views me as a potential asset,\" Isamara mutters.\n"
"You ask Isamara what she would have you do. \"Steal the Wellspring. Take it far away from here. I don't know how to say it more plainly. As long as it is in Abarran's grasp, he will use it to aggrandize himself. Even worse, I fear that the longer its powers are used, the greater the chance of harm coming to those in the casino. Who knows what seemingly impossible catastrophes it may summon if it is not removed?\"\n"
"Her words seem not so much a plea for help as a call to action. You find yourself agreeing to the task almost without conscious thought. As you move to stand, she stops you with her hand.\n"
"\"One last thing: do not underestimate Abarran. He is a dangerous man. He puts on a face of civility to the world, but underneath that mask there is a barely contained anger that can explode if he feels his prize is threatened. I've seen his temper, and I don't doubt it could drive him to tear a man limb from limb with his bare hands if he felt he had the cause.\" Left with that cheery thought, you begin planning a heist with the highest stakes."

"伊萨玛拉来时穿著深蓝色的风衣，宽边帽下露出一缕卷曲的棕发。很显然她不希望被认出来。她没有浪费时间寒暄，直接切入重点：“你对赌场的怀疑是对的。表面上它只是一般的赌场，但背后其实有常人难以想像的力量。幕后黑手是一个名为‘时运之子’的邪教，他们才是真正的掌权者。他们极度危险，任何太接近真相或阻碍他们的人都会面临凄惨的命运。”\n"
"你询问赌场老板是谁，他又跟邪教有什么关联。伊萨玛拉苦笑著说：“你是说阿巴兰吧？他就是首领，不只如此，他还是他们之中最糟的。是他把赌场带来这里，更重要的是，他带来了‘泉源’。”\n"
"伊萨玛拉说赌场的金库中放著一个充满力量的神秘遗物。就是它导致赌场那些奇异事件发生。这件物品叫做时运泉源，它具有操纵机率跟运气的力量。阿巴兰不允许任何人靠近它，它能让幸运永远眷顾它的拥有者，不管出于多自私的行为，甚至能造成毁灭。长年来他收拢了一群忠诚的使徒，利用遗物的力量给予他们一些小恩小惠以控制他们，他们将这件遗物奉为神明。很容易区别那些信徒跟一般的赌场员工，他们脖子上都会带著独特、外型像钱币的护身符。“阿巴兰出于某种原因而信任我，他甚至邀请我加入。也许他将我视为某种有潜力的资产。”伊萨玛拉呢喃著说。\n"
"你问伊萨玛拉希望你怎么做。“我想不到委婉的说法，所以我就直说了：偷走时运泉源，把它带离这里。只要它还在阿巴兰手中，他就会继续利用它来造成悲剧。更可怕的是，我害怕越是使用它的力量，人们就会遭受更大的危险，谁知道它还能招来多巨大的灾难？”\n"
"她不像是在请求帮助，反而比较像在下达命令，但你还是想都没想就答应了。你准备起身离开时，她拉住了你的手。\n"
"“最后一件事：别低估了阿巴兰，他非常危险。他在别人面前带著一张文明的面具，但在伪装之下是满腔的怒火，如果他发现有人觊觎自己的东西，就会毫不犹豫的爆发出来。我见识过他的怒气，我毫不怀疑他能徒手将人五马分尸，如果他觉得有必要的话。”你带著这个令人“振奋”的消息离开，开始筹划一场惊天劫案。"
