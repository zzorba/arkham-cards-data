msgid "The road to Eastwick Bog branches sharply off from the same road you took in from Akwan. The landscape is incredibly vibrant, almost tropical, with rainbow-patterned tree trunks standing guard at the edge of black mirrored ponds. Dr. Marquez and Judith trade friendly barbs in the truckbed, occasionally swatting away gnats. As the conversation turns sour, you attempt to break the tension by asking Judith for a hunting story."
msgstr "你们走在前往艾湾的路上，一条分岔路急遽转向，指引通往东方沼泽的方向。这里的地貌茂盛的令人难以置信，几乎像是热带雨林的景观，树干上有虹彩般的图样，树木如静默的守卫般伫立在黑色镜面般的平静池塘旁。马尔克斯博士跟茱蒂丝在后车斗互相挖苦，偶尔挥手赶走叮人的蚊虫，一开始她们的谈话还是以善意居多，但气氛逐渐变得紧张。你询问朱蒂丝有没有什么有趣的狩猎故事，试图打破这个紧绷的状态。"

"Judith doesn’t miss a beat. “See this scar? I got it in a fight at a speakeasy. Some rich kid cut me with a broken bottle. A friendly scuffle, y’know. His family was from this area, and very rich, I’ll add again, and they were so afraid a scandal’d break out that they offered me a job. Not that I woulda ratted on him.”\n"
"“I don’t know what I expected to hear from a bodyguard, but it wasn’t that,” says Dr. Marquez, possibly annoyed. An acrid breeze, smelling sweetly of death, blows off the bog and ends the conversation. The truck comes to a stop. Judith rolls her eyes, pulls on a pair of old waders, and walks out onto the bog, rifle slung over her shoulder.\n"
"“Believe me or don’t. I’m just here for the money.”"

"茱蒂丝毫不迟疑地说：“看到这个疤吗？这是在一场酒吧斗殴里弄的，一个富家子弟用碎玻璃瓶割伤我，只是场友善的争执，你懂得。他的家族就来自这一区，容我再强调一次，他们非常有钱，而且担心这种丑闻会传出去，所以他们给了我一个工作，换取我守口如瓶。”\n"
"马尔克斯博士有点烦躁地说：“我不知道自己想从保镳那听到什么样的故事，但绝对不是这种。”一股刺鼻的微风拂过沼泽，打断了谈话，空气中带著一丝死物的甜腻味。卡车停了下来，茱蒂丝翻了个白眼，穿上一套老旧的防水连身衣，将来福枪扛在肩上，走进沼泽之中。\n"
"“信不信由你，我是看在钱的份上才来的。”她说。"

"The young woman’s steely demeanor relaxes. “Something big lives in Eastwick Bog. An apex predator the size of a killer whale, with razor sharp teeth and too many eyes. Smells like rotten seaweed.” You tell her it sounds like she has personal experience with the creature, and she nods. “I owe it. Or it owes me. See this?” She points to the wicked scar on her cheek. “That thing almost took my eye. I plan to settle the score.” Dr. Marquez is nonplussed. “I guess you think an academic will buy up any story, but if you expect me to believe—” An acrid breeze, smelling sweetly of death, blows off the bog and stops Judith mid-retort. The truck comes to a stop. Judith pulls a bandana over her nose and mouth, slides into a pair of old waders and walks out onto the bog, rifle slung over her shoulder.\n"

"这位年轻女性紧绷著的表情放松了下来，“东方沼泽里有某种巨型生物，一只跟杀人鲸差不多大小的顶级掠食者，牙齿跟剃刀一样利，眼睛的数量多的不自然，全身散发腐烂海草的味道。”你提出这听起来像是她的亲身经历，她点了点头：“牠欠我一次，我跟牠有笔帐要算，看到这个了吗？”她指著自己脸上的一道狰狞的疤痕说，“那玩意儿差点弄瞎我的眼睛，我打算以眼还眼。”马尔克斯博士看起来有点不知所措：“我猜妳觉得一个学者会接受任何天方夜谭，但如果妳期望我会相信妳的话 — ”一股刺鼻的微风拂过沼泽，打断了茱蒂丝的反驳，空气中带著一丝死物的甜腻味。卡车停了下来，茱蒂丝用头巾摀住口鼻，穿上一套老旧的防水连身衣，将来福枪扛在肩上，走进沼泽之中。\n"

msgid "“I really didn’t get what everyone else liked about Journey to the Center of the Earth. A hollow earth? It sounds insane,” Theo chatters as rain hammers down on the truck cabin. The landscape is incredibly vibrant, almost tropical, with rainbow-patterned tree trunks standing guard at the edge of black mirrored ponds. The truck suddenly hits a patch of deep mud and squelches to a halt. “I think I need some help,” Theo says."
msgstr "我真的不懂为什么大家都喜欢看《地心冒险》，中空的地球？听起来太疯狂了。”西奥的闲聊声伴随著大雨打在车厢上的声音。沼泽的地貌茂盛的令人难以置信，几乎像是热带雨林的景观，树干上有虹彩般的图样，树木如静默的守卫般伫立在黑色镜面般的平静池塘旁。卡车突然停下，陷入一漥烂泥中，轮子不断发出空转的声音。西奥说：“我好像需要一点帮助。”"

Theo waves dismissively. “I can get those on the way back. I’ve got some family stuff back in Akwan to take care of.” Theo leaves you at the edge of the bog, wreathed in mist in the chill rain."
msgstr "经过一番挣扎，你们设法将车轮推出了坑洞，指引西奥通过满是坑洞的崎岖河岸。几袋补给品从车斗掉出来，西奥不在意的挥挥手说：“我回程的时候再捡吧，我得去艾湾处理一些家务事。”西奥将你们放在沼泽边缘，冰冷的雨雾笼罩你们。"

msgstr "每位调查员在下一场冒险开始时减少1次行动。"

msgid "Theo presses his shoulder to the rear of the truck as you rev the gas. The vehicle lurches forward only to bury the front tire in another pothole. Theo jumps into the truck next to you and lets out an exhasperated sigh. “I think you’ll have to continue on foot from here. It’s not that far.”"
msgstr "西奥在车后用肩膀顶著卡车，你则大力踩下油门，车子向前猛冲，前轮却再度落入另一个坑洞中。西奥在你身边跳上车，恼怒的喘著气说：“我想你们可能得走过去，已经不远了。”"

msgstr "每位调查员在下一场冒险开始时减少2资源。"

msgid "The road to Eastwick Bog is covered in rough potholes that reflect a brilliant, prismatic sheen in the sky above. Theo stops the truck as the road grows treacherous. “I’m sorry to do this, but this old girl can’t make the trip through all that mud,” Theo says. You step off the truckbed, say goodbye to Theo, and walk down the muddy road past a close thicket of gaudy, colored trees riven with cracks of light."
msgstr "通往东方沼泽的路上布满积水的坑洞，映射著天空中明亮多彩的光芒。随著道路越来越崎岖，西奥停下了卡车说到：“抱歉，我也不想这样，但这台老伙计没办法通过那些泥巴。”你们下了车，向他道别，然后步行穿越泥泞的道路，路边的树木被染上艳丽的色彩，光芒从树干上的裂缝倾泄而出。"

msgid "The moonlight is as bright as day, illuminating the desolate landscape around the truck like something in a Grimm fairy tale. An acrid breeze blows off the bog, smelling sweetly of death, as you pull to a stop on the shoreline and look up at the moon, veiled in gathering clouds. A single thin tree stands silhouetted against the moon, reaching up like a grasping hand. You hoist your supplies out of the truck and look back. The thin tree has disappeared, leaving a dark ripple in its wake."
msgstr "明亮的月光将夜晚变得如白天一般，照亮卡车旁荒凉的地貌，像是在童话故事中。一股刺鼻的微风拂过沼泽，空气中带著一丝死物的甜腻味，你们停在岸边，抬头望著月亮逐渐被云给遮盖。月光映照出一棵孤立瘦长的树木，它的轮廓直入天际，像是朝天空伸出双手一般。你们将补给品从卡车上卸下，但一转头那棵瘦高的树木就消失了，只在黑暗中留下一片涟漪。"

I mean, I’m sure it’d kill us if it saw us. But, well,” he waves his hand. “I’m glad I found you. There was something moving down on the shore, but I didn’t bother checking.

msgid "You can tell from the moment your clippers cut the stem that something is wrong. The reptile moans as you lift the glowing gray blossom from its back, then opens its mouth to expose rows of serrated teeth as it snaps at you. Arsenic white fluid spurts from the hollow stem, coating you with a stinking secretion that burns your skin. You nearly drop the blossom as you stumble back, realizing your mistake. The vapors from the fluid make you dizzy and lend the forest an exaggerated fluorescence. The poor reptilian creature flails in pain and sinks, leaving swirls of milky blood on the surface. A sharp pain forces you to drop the alkaloid blossom, and you examine your hand to find a sharp cut on your palm. The shape of the wound suggests the stem had begun to penetrate the flesh. You put the sample in a specimen jar and head for the southern shore."
msgstr "你正在用剪刀采集这些植物的茎，但你感到有什么事不对劲。在你将发出灰光的花朵从牠背上摘下时，这只龟型生物发出哀号，牠张开带著锯齿状尖牙的巨嘴朝你咬下。中空的花茎流出白色的砷化物液体，分泌物滴在你的皮肤上，造成刺痛跟灼烧感。你踉跄后退，差点松手放开花朵，同时意识到自己犯了个错。那些液体蒸散发出的气体让你感到头晕目眩，周遭的森林也染上一层夸张的萤光。那只可怜的爬虫类在痛苦中挥动四肢，沉入水中，在水面上留下一团乳白色的血液。一股尖锐的刺痛袭来，迫使你放开这些状似水仙的花朵，你查看自己的手，发现手掌上有一道尖锐的割痕，伤口的形状显示花茎刚才已经开始试图穿透你的血肉。你将样本放进采样罐，转身朝著南岸走去。"
