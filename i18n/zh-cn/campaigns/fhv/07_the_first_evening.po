"As you return to Hemlock Vale, a young red-headed girl in a rabbit mask introduces herself as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter, and leads you by the hand to dinner in the Commons. The long building’s large barn doors are open to let out the rich scent of roasted vegetables and savory meat. The people of the Vale sit and eat in lively conversation, each of them in their white-gold cloaks. At the head of the room, Mother Rachel stands up and calls for attention. Rebecca leads you to the now-picked-over dinner spread as the room falls silent.\n"
"“<i>Meine lieben Freunde.</i> What a blessing that all of us have come here, on the threshold of infinity. And what a greater blessing still that pilgrims have come here, so full of light and curiosity!” Mother Rachel gestures to Dr. Marquez to her right, and to you. “We have waited for the right moment to open our community. Our community which is truly the ‘Sanctuary of Transfiguration’ we long dreamed of. For each of us yearns to be remade as we wait to join our light with the light of the cosmos.”\n"
"The room bursts into applause as Leah Atwood and several locals place trays of honeyed cakes topped with robust red fruit in the center of each table. Your stomach grumbles as you take a bite of shriveled greens. It has a faint bitter taste, and a sharp smell."

"你们回到铁杉谷，一个带著兔子面具的红发女孩向你们自我介绍，她叫蕾贝卡，瑞秋主母的女儿。她牵著你们的手到城镇大堂用晚餐，这栋长方形的建筑是由谷仓改建而成的，烤蔬菜跟烤肉的香味从大开著的谷仓大门传进你们的鼻子。谷地的人们穿著衬金白袍，坐在一起用餐，一边热络的聊著天。在主桌的首座，瑞秋主母站起身，准备发言，就在蕾贝卡带你们夹取晚餐时，整座大堂安静了下来。\n"
"“亲爱的亲朋好友，以无垠之名，赐予我们恩惠，让我们能齐聚一堂。朝圣者们也加入我们，为我们添增祝福，他们是多么充满光明与好奇心！”瑞秋主母挥手示意坐在她右手边的马尔克斯博士，以及你们其他人。“我们已经等待了许久，等候正确的时机开放我们的社区，我们长久以来梦想将社区打造成‘升变圣所’，因为我们每个人都渴望能重塑自我，耐心等待著将我们的荣光与宇宙之光合而为一。”\n"

I attended seances with Sarah Winchester, studied mesmerism in France, and became a member of the Ghost Club in London. Everywhere I studied, I learned more and more of our connectedness. Our many-faceted oneness. And so I brought my learning home, to my family, where it always belonged.”"

My grandfather Wilbur commanded dozens of whaling vessels. But his pride and joy was the Annabelle Lee.” He looks forlornly at his elderly mother. “Naturally, it sank. As did the profits from the whaling industry. My grandfather blamed it all on some kind of curse. He believed in it so strongly that he locked my poor mother in the attic of our family home for weeks at a time.”\n"
