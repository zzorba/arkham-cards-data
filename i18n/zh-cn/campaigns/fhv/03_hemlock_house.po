"“Oh, please, it’s not haunted.” Theo smiles nonchalantly as he pulls his truck to a stop in front of the towering, shingle style manor. “Old Gideon says a lot of things about this place. But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people,” he laughs. “I’m sure there’s something to it. Rumor is, there’s some kinda infestation in there. Rats, probably. Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. It’s an old house, y’know? Lots of nooks in the walls, places for them to hide. Brother William asked Ms. Park to find and repair ‘em, clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls, but she hasn’t gotten around to it yet. I still got all those supplies in my truck, if you feel like helping out.”\n"
"You unload several planks of wood, a box of tools, and a bucket of some foul- smelling chemical mixture from the back of Theo’s truck. As he drives off, you stare up at the crumbling manor. There is something crooked and unsettling in the arrangement of its windows, the slant of its gambrel roofs. The house’s previous grandeur has not set right with the landscape, perhaps by some crack in its foundation—or, if the rumors are right, whatever lives within its walls."

"“喔拜托，这里没有闹鬼啦。”西奥漫不经心地微笑，他将卡车停在一栋高耸的瓦格式大宅外。“老吉迪恩总是说这里有问题，但你们要知道，他也相信有个海底王国，里面还住满了鱼人！”西奥大笑著说。“不过我确定里面的确有什么东西，传闻说里面有些动静，八成是老鼠，也有可能是森林里的野生动物把这里当作避难所。你们懂的，这里很老旧了，墙壁里都是洞，牠们有很多地方躲。威廉弟兄有请朴小姐来修理，顺便把住在墙壁里的东西赶走，但她还没有时间来处理。我把修理的材料带上了，你们应该用得著。”\n"
"你们从西奥的卡车上卸下几块长木板、一箱工具，还有一桶刺鼻的化学混合物。他驾车离开，你们转身看著这座摇摇欲坠的大宅，窗户的排列方式、层叠式屋顶的倾斜角度，整栋房子的格局散发出一种令人不适的躁动感。这栋曾经宏伟的大宅与周遭的地形有点格格不入，也许是地基出现了裂痕，又或许，如果传言属实，是由于住在墙壁中的生物，不管牠们到底是什么。"

"The rear wheels of Theo’s truck spit up mud as it putters toward the cape, where the shingle style manor towers atop a ruinous hill. “There it is,” Theo says, pointing at the silhouette of the manor, barely visible through the torrent of rain beating down on the windshield. “Old Gideon says a lot of things about this place. But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people,” He laughs. “I’m sure there’s something to it. Rumor is, there’s some kinda infestation in there. Rats, probably. Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. It’s an old house, y’know? Lots of nooks in the walls, places for them to hide. Gotta be even worse with all this rain.”\n"
"Having seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle, you know better than to assume the house’s other inhabitants to be mere rats or raccoons. You ask Theo what Mr. Hemlock wants done to the place, which elicits a brief chuckle. “He asked Ms. Park to repair the place and clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls. They’re both there right now, I think, if you wanna help out or chat with them. Can’t believe he still thinks the place is salvageable, but hey, who am I to judge?”\n"
"Theo drops you off in front of the crumbling manor so you don’t have to plod through mud and rain. You shudder as you glance up at its crooked frame. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its gambrel roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls."

"西奥的卡车溅起一阵泥巴，你们正开往海峡，有座瓦格式大宅耸立在前方荒废的山丘上。“就是那里。”西奥指著前方说，滂沱大雨击打在挡风玻璃上，你们很勉强才看见宅邸的轮廓。“老吉迪恩总是说这里有问题，但你们要知道，他也相信有个海底王国，里面还住满了鱼人！”西奥大笑著说。“不过我确定里面的确有什么东西，传闻说里面有些动静，八成是老鼠，也有可能是森林里的野生动物把这里当作避难所。你们懂的，这里很老旧了，墙壁里都是洞，牠们有很多地方躲。这么大的雨可能会让情况更糟。”\n"
"与赫姆拉克岛上潜藏的恐怖正面冲突过，你们合理推断栖息在大宅中的，绝对不是老鼠或浣熊这么简单。你们问西奥，赫姆拉克先生是想要怎么处理这栋宅邸，他轻笑著说：“他请朴小姐帮忙修理，顺便把藏在墙壁里的东西赶出来。如果你们想帮忙或跟他们聊聊，我想他们两个现在应该都在那了。我不敢相信他居然还觉得这里能修好，不过，嘿，我算哪根葱啊。”\n"
"西奥将你们放在摇摇欲坠的大宅门口，你们才不必在大雨中走过泥泞的道路。大宅令人不适的外观让你们打了一个冷颤，窗户的排列方式、层叠式屋顶的倾斜角度，整栋房子的格局散发出一种深沉的躁动感。不管这里曾经有多气派辉煌，都已经是很久以前的事了。它现在只剩一具空壳，而你们怀疑造成这一切的原因仍栖息在断垣残壁中。"

"“Considering what Brother William was prattling on about last night at the dance? Yeah, maybe it is haunted. I dunno.” Theo sighs as his truck pulls to a stop in front of the towering, shingle style manor. Dark clouds loom over its gambrel roofs, its frame crooked and misshapen. Its attic truss is burnt almost to the frame, its outer wall exposed to the elements by extensive fire damage. “Old Gideon says a lot of things about this place. But old Gideon also believes in underwater kingdoms filled with fish people. Still...” Theo sighs, shaking his head. “Maybe there is something to it all. I thought if there was an infestation, it was probably rats, y’know? Maybe even some wild animals taking refuge from the woods. But Brother William looked downright terrified when he came back into town yesterday. Who knows?”\n"
"You ask Theo what Mr. Hemlock was doing here—perhaps you can help figure out what’s wrong with the place. “Last I checked, he asked Ms. Park to repair the place and clear out whatever’s hiding in the walls. That was a couple days ago. Ms. Park’s still here, but after yesterday I don’t think Brother William’s gonna be venturing anywhere near this place until it’s cleaned up.”\n"
" You point the fire damage out to Theo, who gives a whistle in response. “Yeah, that’s new. I did hear some pretty close thunder during that storm last night. Wouldn’t be surprised if that was from lightning. Lucky the rain must’ve put the fire out.” You wonder if it was in fact fortune that kept the old manor standing, or something else entirely. As if in response to your ruminations, something slithers just out of view from the exposed floor of the attic. You ask Theo if he saw it, but he only shrugs. “Saw what? You don’t plan on heading up there, do you? Be careful. This place was decrepit even before the storm.” He turns the ignition off and gets out of the truck, joining you under the awning of the manor’s front porch. “I’ll come with, ok? I won’t go all the way up there, but just in case something happens, I’ll be here.”\n"
"You nod. Having seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle, you know better than to assume the house’s other inhabitants to be mere rats or raccoons. It might be nice having Theo and his truck on hand for a swift exit. Taking in a deep breath, you glance once more at the manor’s crooked frame. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls.\n"
"Upon entering the house, you immediately climb its inner staircase up to the attic, leaving Theo downstairs. Scarred by fire damage and partially exposed to the wind, the decrepit bedroom bears no trace of whatever creature you saw from below. With each of your steps, the old building groans precariously. You cannot help but wonder if it is in fact the rumbling of an empty stomach..."

"“昨晚舞会的时候，威廉弟兄一直在喃喃自语这里的事，也许这里真的闹鬼了，我不确定。”西奥叹了口气，在一栋高耸的瓦格式大宅前停下卡车。黑云笼罩在层叠式屋顶上，宅邸外型扭曲且令人感到不适，阁楼突出的部分烧到只剩骨架，外墙处处都有大片烧焦的痕迹。“老吉迪恩总是说这里有问题，但你们要知道，他也相信有个海底王国，里面还住满了鱼人。可是……”西奥叹气，摇著头继续说：“也许真的有什么东西，我之前以为里面的动静八成是因为老鼠，你们懂的，也有可能是森林里的野生动物把这里当作避难所。但在威廉弟兄昨天从这里回到镇上后，他看起来彻底吓坏了。谁知道呢？”\n"
"你们询问赫姆拉克先生在这里做什么，也许你们可以帮忙找出这里发生了什么事。“据我所知，他请朴小姐修理这里，同时赶走躲在墙壁里的东西，不管牠们是什么。那是几天前的事了。朴小姐还在这里，但我想经过昨天的事后，在这里被清理干净前，威廉弟兄都不会再靠近这了。”\n"
"你们指著火烧的痕迹给西奥看，他吹了个口哨说：“嗯，真新奇。我听说昨晚的暴风雨中有几道雷打得很近，如果是雷电造成的我也不意外，还好大雨顺便把火扑灭了。”你们怀疑到底是运气保住了大宅，还是完全无关的其他东西。就像在回应你们的猜测，一道影子从阁楼凸出的地板上一闪即逝，你们问西奥有没有看见，但他只是耸耸肩：“看到什么？你们不是真的要上去对吧？小心点，这地方在暴风雨来前就已经很脆弱了。”他将卡车熄火，跳下车，走到宅邸的前廊下与你们会合。“我一起去，可以吧？我不会陪你们上去，但万一出了什么事，我会在这。”\n"
"与赫姆拉克岛上潜藏的恐怖正面冲突过，你们合理推断栖息在大宅中的，绝对不是老鼠或浣熊这么简单。有个退路总是好的，有西奥跟他的卡车，你们可以快速撤离这里，你们深吸一口气，看了大宅令人不适的外观最后一眼，窗户的排列方式、层叠式屋顶的倾斜角度，整栋房子的格局散发出一种深沉的躁动感。不管这里曾经有多气派辉煌，都已经是很久以前的事了。它现在只剩一具空壳，而你们怀疑造成这一切的原因仍栖息在断垣残壁中。\n"
"进入屋内，你们迳直爬上楼梯前往阁楼，将西奥留在楼下。破碎的卧房有火焰灼烧的痕迹，部分还暴露在风雨中，但没有其他生物的踪迹。随著你们的脚步，老旧的建筑发出随时会崩塌的呻吟，但你们怀疑其实声音也许是从你们翻搅的空腹中传出的……。"

"Theo’s truck slows to a halt as you pull up in front of the towering, shingle style manor. From what you’ve been told, the old Hemlock House is infested with something or other—what exactly is a matter of some debate. Before lending you his truck for the night, Theo made mention of rats in the walls, or potentially wild animals taking refuge from the woods, not to mention the storm brewing on the horizon. But you’re not so sure. After all, you’ve already seen firsthand the kinds of terrors that dwell on Hemlock Isle—you know better than to assume mere rats or raccoons to be the issue.\n"
"Approaching the crumbling manor, you find a stockpile of supplies tucked away near its entrance: several planks of wood, a box of tools, and a bucket of some foul-smelling chemical mixture. According to Theo, Mr. Hemlock had asked Judith to try to fix the place up and clear out whatever was infesting its walls. Seems like she hasn’t gotten very far yet. You look up at the house’s crooked frame, set against a backdrop of dark stormclouds. There is something deeply unsettling about the arrangement of its windows and the slant of its gambrel roofs. Whatever grandeur this house may have had in its past life is long gone. It is but a shell of its former self—and you suspect the cause still dwells within its walls."

msgstr "威廉来回踱步，看似对老房子的每道裂痕都十分惧怕。你询问他是否一切安好，引起这位闷闷不乐的赫姆拉克末裔一阵叹息：“喔，一切再好不过了。茱蒂丝跑了，留我一个人；我找不到母亲的娃娃；还有我儿时的家无时无刻都在崩坏。除此之外再好不过了。”他语带苦涩说著。“帮我找到茱蒂丝，好吗？那个勇敢的小姐应该要保护我，帮我把这里清理干净的。”他紧紧跟著你，在屋子忿恨的嚎叫声中，他的视线在每道阴影之间来回游移。"

msgid "Gideon barely looks up from a musty book as you approach. “I don’t suppose ye’ve ever heard the story of the Delilah?” You tell him no, but you think you’re about to. He laughs. “The Delilah was a fishing vessel that mapped this island years ago.” He grabs another book as he rambles on about not only the Delilah, but also three other tangential stories. At length, you glean that the old man is looking for a map somewhere in the parlor."
msgstr "吉迪恩盯著一本发霉的书本，即使你靠近也几乎没抬头看你。“我想你应该没听过狄莱拉号的故事吧？”你回答没有，但心想他应该马上就会开始讲了。他大笑著说：“狄莱拉号是一条渔船，好几年前它绘制了这座岛的地图。”他边拿起另一本书，边喋喋不休地说著关于狄莱拉号，还有另外三个能跟这艘船扯上一些关系的故事。在冗长的故事中，你终于听出老人要找的是一张地图，就在这个客厅里。"

msgstr "你可以取消下次掠食。请记住“你正在帮助吉迪恩”。任意一位调查员可以再次触发此圣典。"

msgid "“Rats. ‘Rats,’ he said!” Judith scoffs. “Rats, my ass...” she trails off into grumbles, then faces you with a stern expression. “This place is a cesspool. There’s something in the walls that I swear is following me.” Any fear within her seems to have settled into anger. “It’s no wonder he didn’t want to come back with me today. There’s no ‘legacy’ here. Just a bunch of ugly furniture, and whatever creature has taken up residence.” You ask what she thinks should be done. “It’s too dangerous to be left alone as it is.” She may be right—it would surely upset William, but left as is, this house is a danger to him and the rest of Hemlock Isle."
msgstr "“老鼠，他说只是老鼠！”茱蒂丝歇斯底里的叫喊著，“老鼠个鬼……。”当她终于停止抱怨，她带著严肃的表情面向你说：“这地方根本是邪恶的巢穴，我发誓墙壁里有什么东西在跟著我。”她恐惧的情绪似乎全都转换成了怒气。“难怪今天他不愿意跟我过来。这里根本没有什么‘遗产’，只有丑不啦叽的家具，还有占据这栋房子的生物，不管牠们是什么鬼东西。”你问她现在应该怎么做。“不能放任它继续存在，太危险了。”茱蒂丝也许是对的，虽然威廉一定会生气，但放任这栋屋子不管，无论对他还是铁杉谷的居民们都是一个威胁。"

msgid "Take control of Judith Park. Remember that “Judith is remodeling.”"
msgstr "控制茱蒂丝．朴。请记住“茱蒂丝正在拆毁房屋。”"

msgid "“There you are,” Judith struts to where William stands daydreaming. He snaps out of his reverie as she approaches, finger pointed at his chest. “You said this place had a rat problem, not...not this,” she says, gesturing vaguely. The two square off, tension thick in the air..."
msgstr "“找到你了。”茱蒂丝气冲冲地走向正在神游的威廉，用手指著他的胸膛，这时候他才终于清醒过来。茱蒂丝歇斯底里地指著周遭说：“你说这个地方有鼠患，但这个……这个根本不是老鼠的问题！”两个人剑拔弩张的看著对方，气氛有点紧绷……。"

msgid "Judith rolls her eyes as you ask her what she’s doing here. “William was here yesterday, but he got creeped out, so he asked me to come with him today to babysit him. Then he ran upstairs to ‘ponder his legacy’ and ‘ruminate upon his forebears’ or whatever nonsense.” She shakes her head. “Look, between you and me, this place is a wreck. Let’s find William, I’ll talk to him, and leave this place to rot. You with me?”"
msgstr "当你问茱蒂丝在做什么时，她翻了个白眼后说：“威廉昨天来过，然后吓得跑走了，所以他今天叫我一起来，当他的褓母。然后他就跑上楼，说要去‘思考他留下的遗产’和‘追寻他的先辈’，之类莫名其妙的事。”她无奈的摇头。“跟你说，别告诉别人，这地方根本就是一片废墟。我们去找威廉，我会说服他，然后我们就离开，让这里自生自灭。你觉得怎么样？”"

Protect you,” he puts on a fake swagger as he helps you to your feet."
