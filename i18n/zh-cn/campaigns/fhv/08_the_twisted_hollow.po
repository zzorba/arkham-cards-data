"“I should have known better than to let that little twit go off on his own. I swear on his precious little grave, if I find that boy plucking violets and reciting poetry, I will have him expelled,” Dr. Marquez almost spits the words as she leads you to one of the Vale’s supply sheds. Searching the village yielded no results: Just a pile of books and Bertie’s leather satchel in his room at the boarding house. Nobody seems to have seen him since the morning.\n"
"The professor opens the rickety shed and grabs an old barn lantern from an iron hook. “Look for oil,” she says gruffly. You mention the locals’ warning against going out at night, and the professor raps her cane on an empty oilcan. “All the more reason to find Bertie.”\n"
"A long shadow falls across you both, and you turn to see Mother Rachel silhouetted against the sunset. “You all left so quickly after dinner. Is there something I can help you find?”"

"“我早该知道不能让那个臭小子自己行动，我对天发誓，如果被我抓到他是跑去哪里摘花或吟诗，我一定会开除他。”马尔克斯博士愤恨的说著，一边带著你走向村庄存放物资的棚屋。你们在村庄中的搜寻一无所获，只在旅店中找到柏蒂留下的一堆书籍跟他的皮制侧背包。从早上开始就没有人再见过柏蒂。\n"
"教授打开破旧的棚屋，从墙上的铁钩拿下一盏旧提灯，气冲冲地说：“找灯油。”你提起当地人的警告，最好不要在晚上出去，教授一边用拐杖敲打著空的灯油罐一边说：“那我们更应该把柏蒂找回来。”\n"

"As you share the dire situation, the elderly woman nods gravely. “As I said when you arrived in the Vale, we do not venture out at night. However, your friend will likely not survive the night if left alone.” She eyes Dr. Marquez’s old lantern. “Please, take my lantern. Stay in the light, and you will find the way much safer.” She leads you to the edge of the forest as the sun sets. The forest air is unnaturally thick, and you find it hard to breathe, but you follow the matron nonetheless. Eventually, Mother Rachel leads you to a broad, open field and gestures to the tenebrous shadows. “From here, you take your lives into your own hands. The people of the Vale will pray for your safe return.”\n"
"Hazy lights dance above the meadow’s yarrow and asters. Mother Rachel points into the murky abyss. “If all else fails, return to the fireflies.”"

"你向她解释目前严峻的状况，年长的女士面色凝重的点了点头：“你们抵达谷地时我就说过，我们不会在晚上出去冒险。不过，如果真的放任你们的朋友不管的话，他很可能没办法活下来。”她看向马尔克斯博士手上的旧提灯。“带著我的提灯去吧，待在光明之中会安全的多。”她引领你们来到森林的边缘，身后的夕阳正在逐渐消失。森林中的空气异常凝重，尽管你感到呼吸困难，但仍紧紧跟著这位修女长。最后，她带领你们来到一片广阔的林间空地，然后指向前方黑暗的阴影：“从这里开始，你们的命运就掌握在自己手中了，谷地的人民会为你们祈祷，希望你们能安全归来。”\n"

"Mother Rachel nods along to your paper-thin story. “I see. Understand that the Vale is here to help. I wish you the best on your survey.” After more polite conversation, the matron leaves you and Dr. Marquez to scour the shed. Finally, you find a chipped mason jar with just a fifth of oil. “We can make it if we portion every bit,” the professor says. You follow the dim lantern light into the maw of gnarled trees toward a quiet stream, then further up and further into the dark.\n"
"Eventually, you reach a collapsed bridge and overgrown cobblestones in the ruins of an old village. The trees overhead rustle. “Something’s there,” Dr. Marquez raises her lantern. A pair of beady eyes reflect the light, but quickly vanish in the murk.\n"
"“Watch yourself and keep close. There’s no telling what’s out here.”"

"瑞秋主母听著你漏洞百出的说词，点著头说：“我懂了，请明白谷地随时都愿意伸出援手，祝你们调查顺利。”她礼貌地寒暄了几句后就离开了。你们继续搜索棚屋，终于找到一个缺口的石罐，里面还剩少量的灯油。“如果谨慎分配的话应该够用了。”教授开口说。你们跟著提灯昏暗的光线走进粗犷森林的巨口中，找到了一条安静的小溪，接著顺流而上，深入黑暗中。\n"
"最终你们抵了一座坍塌的桥梁和一座废弃的村庄遗址，作为建材的鹅卵石四散一地。你们头顶上的树叶发出沙沙的声响，马尔克斯博士举起提灯说：“有东西在这里。”突然，提灯的光芒反射在一双晶亮的眼睛上，接著瞬间又消失在黑暗中。\n"
