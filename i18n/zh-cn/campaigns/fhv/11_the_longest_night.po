"As you approach Atwood Farm, the clouds recede to reveal a blood-red sunset that casts the landscape in hazy shadows. You follow Dr. Marquez past a neglected coop and barn to the back porch of the derelict farmhouse. As the professor jams a crowbar under a boarded window, you notice the revolver in her back pocket. “Just some insurance,” she says.\n"
"It takes some time to pry the boards off the windows. As you climb in after the professor, your senses sting with the scent of rot and sick. Once your eyes adjust to the murk, you see a harrowing scene. Dirty cots line the walls, and the floor is streaked with refuse. A dozen sickly people lay on cots and sit, slumped against the walls. Their skin is knotted and hard, riddled with sharp spurs and sinewy growths. Several of them have limp flaps of loose flesh that you soon realize are vestigial limbs. Others look up at you with glassy eyes, while others with gray, powdery skin lay, inert, staring up at the ceiling.\n"
"“You shouldn’t be here,” says a voice. A balding man in a tattered Vale cloak steps toward you with a halting gait. Dr. Marquez squints in the dim. “Tad? From the general store?” Before he can answer, you hear voices from the front porch. You and Dr. Marquez dash behind a pile of broken furniture just as the front door clicks and swings open. Mother Rachel enters alongside a half dozen cloaked figures and several more sickly locals.\n"
"The matron addresses the room, beaming. “My Star Children. Your time has come at last. You will prepare the way.” She leans down and holds a wheelchair-bound woman’s hand. “All of you have been made whole. And now you will join your other selves in eternity.”"

"你们前往阿特伍德农场，云朵退去，露出血红色的落日，大地被笼罩在一片朦胧的暗影中。你跟著马尔克斯博士走过废弃的鸡舍跟谷仓，来到荒废农舍后方的门廊上。教授拿出一跟撬棍插进封死窗户的木板间，就在这时你看见她后面的口袋中插著一把左轮手枪，她说：“只是以防万一。”\n"
"你们花了一点时间才撬开木板，你跟在教授身后爬进窗户，立刻闻到一股刺鼻的腐败与患病气味。当你的眼睛适应了晦暗的光线，眼前的景象让你惊恐不已。肮脏的板床在墙边排成一列，地上堆满各种垃圾与废弃物，十几名带著病容的人或躺在板床上，或颓然的坐倒在墙边，他们的皮肤僵硬而纠结，长满尖锐的尖刺跟突起的瘤块。有几个人还长著几块松垮的赘肉，你细看后才发现那是退化的四肢。有些人用呆滞的目光看著你们，另一些有著发灰、粉末化皮肤的人则眼神空洞地盯著天花板。\n"
"“你们不该在这里的。”一道声音说，一个穿著破烂谷地罩袍的光头男子犹豫地走上前，对你们说到。马尔克斯博士瞇起眼睛，在微光中试图辨认来人：“泰德？开杂货店的？”在他回答前，你们听见前门廊传来声音，迅速躲到一堆破烂的家具后，门随即发出解锁的声响并打开，瑞秋主母带著六名身穿罩袍的身影走进来，还带著更多患病的当地人。\n"
"修女长问候房间中的人，大声宣告：“我的众星之子，你们的时刻终于到来了。你们将准备踏上道路。”她俯下身握住一名坐著轮椅的女人的手，“你们都已完整，现在是时候加入永恒中的另一个自我了。”"

"Mother Rachel smiles benevolently. “My children. There are some things we are not meant to see until it is our time to see them. But then, I suppose, it is your place to witness our ascension.” She holds her arms out in an exultant pose. “Each of us accepts our place in creation. We have been remade beyond the concerns of conventional medicine. I understand it may seem foolish, even cruel, to an outsider, but each of us is here of our own volition. Even you.” The room nods along in agreement.\n"
"“You’re being deceived! Can’t you see?” Dr. Marquez says, furious. “These people are dying!” You search the room, hoping for some support."

"瑞秋主母慈祥地笑著说：“我的孩子们，有些事我们在被允许见证前，都不应该看见。不过我想，也许你们的天命就是见证我们的升华。”她欢欣鼓舞地伸出双臂，“我们每个人都要接受自己被创造出来的天命，我们已经重塑自我，超越了传统医学的范畴。我了解在外人的眼中，这很愚蠢，甚至残忍，然而我们每个人都是出于自身的意志来到这里的，即使是你们也一样。”房间中的人们点著头，出声同意。\n"
"“你们被蒙蔽了！妳还看不出来吗？”马尔克斯博士狂怒的大吼，“这些人正在死去！”你们扫视房间，希望有人能支持你们。"

"Mother Rachel’s eyes are glassy with tears as she addresses the room. “Your sacrifice is not in vain. Tonight, you each will fulfill your place in creation and join us tomorrow for the great ascension.” The matron wears a careworn smile as she addresses you. “This is not your sacrifice to make. Please, return to the Vale.” Dr. Marquez glowers in response. Mother Rachel’s eyes well with tears as she leaves with her procession.\n"
"“What did she mean by ‘ fulfill your place in creation’?” Dr. Marquez asks Tad as he rubs scaly growths from his forearms. The balding man smiles. “Tomorrow, the blood moon heralds our ascension. But tonight, on the shortest night of the year, all the creatures of the forest and fields will help us complete our journey.”\n"
"“I’m sorry, but that doesn’t answer my question,” the professor replies.\n"
"Tad grins. “We will all be devoured. It is our place to make this sacrifice.” As he looks to the horizon, a chorus of mournful howls echoes across the fields.\n"
"The professor looks at Tad, horrified. “Like hell you will,” she says. You follow her outside. Dark shapes stand outlined on distant hills. The professor is briefly lost in thought, then takes a sharp breath. “I doubt any of them are in their right mind. But maybe if we hold out long enough, we can get them proper care and attention.” You look past the farmhouse to the rolling fields. You don’t have time to evacuate the captives before sunset. Moreover, you don’t have any guarantee they’ll follow you. But you have to try.\n"
"Together, you and the professor scavenge the collapsing farm for spare parts. You find scraps of wood, barbed wire, and old trapping equipment to fortify your position. If you can outlast the night, some of the captives might be saved. A hideous baying breaks the still air as the sun sets.\n"
"The shortest night of the year just became the longest."

"瑞秋主母的眼中充满晶莹的泪水，对房间中的人们布道：“你们的牺牲不会白费。今晚，你们都将实现自己在伟大造物中的天命，并在明日加入我们伟大的升华。”随后修女长带著憔悴的笑容面对你们：“你们不需要做出这种牺牲，请返回谷地。”马尔克斯博士对她怒目而视作为回应。瑞秋主母眼中噙满眼泪，跟她的追随者们一齐离去。\n"
"“她说的‘实现自己在伟大造物中的天命’是什么意思？”马尔克斯博士转头对泰德发问，他正揉著自己前臂上的一个吓人的肿胞，这个光头男子笑著说：“明晚，血月会见证我们的升华。但今晚，一年中最短的夜晚，所有森林里跟原野上的生物会帮助我们完成旅程。”\n"
"“抱歉，但你没有回答到我的问题。”教授说。\n"
"泰德咧嘴笑到：“我们都会被吞噬，我们的天命就是牺牲。”他看向地平线，哀号声所组成的大合唱回荡在整个原野上。\n"
"教授盯著泰德，看起来吓坏了：“见鬼，你们不会真的这么做。”你跟著她走到外面，远方的山丘上立著无数黑暗的形影，教授一瞬间陷入沉思，然后猛吸了一口气：“我怀疑他们的思绪都不太正常，但如果我们可以支撑足够长的时间，也许可以让他们得到适当的照顾跟关注。”你的目光扫过农舍跟前方开阔的田野，太阳完全下山前绝对来不及把这些病人撤离。话说回来，你也不确定他们会不会愿意跟你们走，但你必须全力一试。\n"
"你跟教授一起设法在荒废的农场里找到了一些可用的材料，一些木板、带刺的铁丝，还有老旧的陷阱工具，可以利用它们来巩固你们的防御。如果你们能撑过这个夜晚，也许有些病人能获救。日落了，一声充满恨意的嚎叫打破了静寂的空气。\n"

"The last thing you remember before the nightmarish shapes overwhelm you is a feeling of intense calm. The silver moonlight bathes the farm in stark monochrome as the creatures rip into your flesh. For a moment, you see your place in this world, as Mother Rachel intended. You are merely energy being converted to another form of energy.\n"
"Nothing else seems so perfect."

"无尽的平静，这是你在被梦魇般的形体淹没前，感受到的最后一丝情绪。诡异的生物撕扯你的血肉时，银色的月光将农场染上一层诡异的单色调。这瞬间，你看见了自己在这个世界上的归处，就像瑞秋主母说的一样。你只不过是从一种能量，转变成另一种形式的能量。\n"
"无与伦比的完美。"

msgid "“Please, listen,” Dr. Marquez implores the captives. “Each of you deserves to live a full life. We can help! You can receive care on the mainland.” Tad spits in response. “You’ve robbed us of a great privilege. We were chosen.” Dr. Marquez hardly answers before a jagged plank of wood swings out from behind her, striking her on the shoulder. One of the captives holds it overhead, while several others gather round. Tad looks balefully at the professor and growls, “Leave now.” Dr. Marquez rises gingerly and walks out of the farmhouse. You follow her. “Idiots. We saved their lives,” she scoffs. As you leave, a young girl wearing a rabbit mask peers out from under some debris. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr "“拜托，听著。”马尔克斯博士恳求这些俘虏，“你们所有人都值得好好生活，我们可以帮忙！你们在大陆上可以获得更多医疗帮助。”泰德吐了一口口水做回应：“你们夺走了我们伟大的权力，我们是被选中的人！”马尔克斯博士还来不及回答，一根粗糙的木板从后面砸中她的肩膀，一名病患将木板举高过头，其他几个病患也开始聚集。泰德用恶毒的眼神盯著她，低吼到：“现在就离开。”马尔克斯博士战战兢兢地起身，走出农舍，你跟在她身后。“一群笨蛋，我们救了他们的命。”她怒斥著。你们离开时，一个戴著兔子面具的小女孩从瓦砾堆底下偷看你们，你认出她是蕾贝卡，瑞秋主母的女儿。"

msgid "Tad stands in the center of the farmhouse, his white- gold Vale cloak stained crimson. Surrounding him, the half-eaten corpses of the slain captives are arranged in a kind of circle. When you approach, the middle-aged man laughs bitterly. “Why was I spared, and so many others taken?” He raises both hands to his face and laughs hysterically. “Why is everything so bright?!” he giggles, clawing at his own eyes. You turn away and join Dr. Marquez outside, hunched over a pile of wreckage. A young girl wearing a rabbit mask scrambles out from underneath the debris. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr "泰德站在农舍正中央，谷地衬金白袍被染上鲜红的颜色。在他周围，被啃食一半的俘虏尸体排成了一个奇怪的圆。你们靠近时，这位中年男子露出苦笑：“为什么只有我被留下了，而其他人都被带走了？”他双手摀面，歇斯底里地大笑，“为什么所有东西都这么亮？！”他狂笑著，紧抓著双眼。你转身离开，到外面与马尔克斯博士会合，她弯身看著一片残骸，一个戴著兔子面具的小女孩跌跌撞撞地从瓦砾堆底下走出来。你认出她是蕾贝卡，瑞秋主母的女儿。"

msgid "“We can’t stay!” Dr. Marquez shouts. Utterly overwhelmed, you dash out of the fray and into the cornfields. Nightmarish shadows charge past you, braying and howling. You think of the captives in the farmhouse, staring their deaths head-on. At the far edge of the field, you find Dr. Marquez holding a young girl wearing a rabbit mask. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr "“我们不能待在这！”马尔克斯博士大喊。你被恐惧淹没，脱离战场冲进玉米田中，梦魇般的形体从你身旁跑过，发出嘶吼与嚎叫，你想起了农舍里的俘虏，眼睁睁看著他们死去。在田野的另一端，你找到了马尔克斯博士，她牵著一个戴著兔子面具的小女孩，你认出她是蕾贝卡，瑞秋主母的女儿。"

"The morning sun beats down, blindingly bright, as you cut through the fields back to the Vale. Flecks of slick, dark liquid drip from the withered stalks as you push through. Dr. Marquez stops and runs a hand under the brittle leaves. “The fields are painted with blood. But why?” She wipes the blood on a handkerchief and surveys the dripping field. “What kind of monster would do this? Sentencing her followers—her own daughter—to death. It’s almost biblical.”\n"
"Rebecca pulls back her mask and shakes her head. “Mother says it’s our way. And she doesn’t want me to die. She told me to hide. She said we were playing a game. ‘Make yourself very small and hide near the barrels of kerosene. The animals won’t smell you there’.”\n"
"“But why bring you here at all?” the professor asks.\n"
"“Some people didn’t want to come to the barn. But when mama told them I would be there too, they said it was okay.”\n"
"The group falls silent as you pass from one field and back into view of the Vale, veiled in gold under the radiant dawn. Suddenly, Dr. Marquez stops and takes you aside. “We may be able to use this as leverage. Rebecca is living proof of Mother Rachel’s hypocrisy, as horrible as that sounds. Everyone on Hemlock Isle will be at the Feast tonight. If we ask Rebecca to tell them what Mother Rachel said to her, we may be able to sway at least some of them to leave. And if that doesn’t work, we can high-tail it back to the mainland and get the law involved.”\n"
"The professor turns to Rebecca. “Can we play a game? Like last night? Your mother told me she wants you to hide until the Feast.” The young girl nods. Dr. Marquez lets out a manic giggle: strangely out of character for her usual controlled affect. You can’t help but suppress a grin, too, despite the horrors you just witnessed."

"你们穿过田野回到谷地，早晨的阳光洒落，刺眼的令人盲目。你们经过一片枯萎的花茎旁，黏稠的液体滴落在地上，形成黑色的斑点。马尔克斯博士停下脚步，轻轻扶起一片脆弱的叶子，“这片田野被洒上了鲜血，为什么？”她用手帕擦去血迹，在血迹斑斑的田野中调查。“什么样的怪物才能做出这种事，要她的追随者 —甚至是自己的女儿去送死。这是什么旧约故事。”\n"
"蕾贝卡抬起面具，摇著头说：“妈妈说这是我们的天命，还有她不想要我死掉，她叫我躲起来，她说我们在玩游戏，她叫我‘把自己卷缩起来，躲在煤油桶附近，动物就闻不到妳了。’”\n"
"“但她一开始为什么要把妳带到这里？”教授问到。“有些人不想去谷仓那里，但妈妈跟他们说我也会去，他们就说好了。”\n"
"所有人都陷入沉默，你们穿过田野，俯瞰著谷地，灿烂的阳光在村庄蒙上一层金色的面纱。马尔克斯博士突然停下，示意你到一旁说话：“我们也许可以把这个当作筹码，揭穿瑞秋主母虚伪的面具，蕾贝卡就是活生生的证据，如果事情真的像她说的一样恐怖的话。今晚赫姆拉克岛上的所有人都会来参加盛宴，如果我们能让蕾贝卡说出瑞秋主母对她说的话，至少能说服一部份的人离开。如果不管用的话，我们就尽速离开，回到大陆上，让法律介入。”\n"
"教授转身对蕾贝卡说：“我们也来玩个游戏好吗？就像昨天晚上一样？妳妈妈跟我说希望妳躲起来，直到盛宴开始。”小女孩点点头，马尔克斯博士发出一声咯咯的笑声，跟她平常严肃的形象完全不合。让你也差点笑了出来，一瞬间忘了稍早目睹的恐怖景象。"
