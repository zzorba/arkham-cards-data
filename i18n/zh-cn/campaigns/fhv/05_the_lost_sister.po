"You are sitting in the small kitchen of the Peters family home in Akwan, on the north shore of Hemlock Isle. Cold Atlantic seawater laps at the stilts below the house as Helen Peters sets her steaming mug on the table. “The north shore caverns are a death trap,” she says firmly. “I don’t think you know what you’re getting into.”\n"
"You tell her you are well aware of the danger. According to local rumors, some folks have gone missing recently. The most recent disappearance was Helen’s sister, so you paid a visit to the Peters home to offer your help.\n"
"Helen looks you over, as if sizing you up, and finally nods. “Alright then. You’re either brave, or you’re stupid. Or you’re both, like my little brother.” She rubs her brow in frustration. “I last saw Lizzie—Elizabeth—taking a walk with our dog Bruce along the coastline. I told her to stay away from those caves, but she never listens. It’s easy to get lost in ‘em and there are things in there that’d haunt your nightmares.” She sets a flashlight on the table. “But that’s where we’re going to start.”"

"你们坐在彼得斯一家的小厨房中，这里是他们在艾湾镇的房子，就在赫姆拉克岛的北海岸线上，冰冷的大西洋海水拍打在架高的支柱上。海伦．彼得斯将她冒著烟的马克杯放在桌上，开口说：“北海岸的洞穴跟死亡陷阱没两样。”她用坚定的语气说到。“我不认为你们知道自己在干什么。”\n"
"你们告诉她你们很清楚潜在的危险性，根据当地人的说法，最近有许多人失踪，最近一个失踪的就是海伦的妹妹，所以你们才来到彼得斯家，表示帮忙的意愿。\n"
"海伦盯著你们，像是在打量你们的本事，最后终于点头：“好吧。你们要不是很勇敢；就是很愚蠢，也许两者皆是，就跟我的弟弟一样。”她挫折的揉著眼眶。“我最后一次看到丽莎，就是伊丽莎白，是她带著我们的狗，布鲁斯，去海边散步的时候。我警告她要离那些洞窟远点，但她从来不听。人们在里面很容易迷失方向，更别说还有那些会让你做恶梦的恐怖东西。”她拿出一个手电筒放到桌上。“但我们还是必须从那里开始。”"

"You follow Helen outside and onto the creaking boardwalks of Akwan village. Nestled in a small, rocky bay on the island’s northern shore, Akwan has been the home of Abenaki families and former whalers for generations. The steady swell and break of seawater on the stony shore lends the scene an eerie disquiet. Helen grabs a harpoon from a whaler’s shack and leads you to the beach.\n"
"A familiar old pickup truck slows to a stop nearby. Theo steps out and greets you with a broad smile. “I’m back! I had to run back to the Vale for something,” he waves. His smile vanishes when he sees Helen.\n"
"“I’m surprised you came,” Helen says cooly.\n"
"Theo looks crestfallen. “Of course I came, sis. How could I not?”\n"
"His sister says nothing as she strides past you both toward the bleak shoreline. A curl of waves crashes against the walk, breaking the apparent drama of the moment. You ask Theo for the reason behind his sister’s chilly response, and he looks distant for a moment.\n"
"“Y’know, sometimes people just grow apart. Like two branches. They’ll always be connected, but they—” The extended metaphor is interrupted by Helen, calling you to the mouth of a seaside cave."

"你们跟著海伦走过艾湾镇破裂的滨海木板道。艾湾镇座落在岛屿北边一个窄小、岩石嶙峻的海湾中，这里世代以来都是阿本拿基族跟前捕鲸人们的家。海水规律的涨退击打在岩岸上，为这里添增了令人毛骨悚然的氛围。海伦手中拿著从捕鲸人小屋借来的鱼叉，引领你们走向海滩。\n"
"一辆熟悉的卡车缓缓停靠在附近，西奥带著灿烂的笑容向你们挥手招呼：“我回来了！我刚才得回谷地一趟。”他一看见海伦，脸上的笑容瞬间消失。\n"
"“我很惊讶你会来。”海伦冷冷地说。\n"
"西奥垂头丧气地说：“我当然会来了，老姊，我怎么能不来？”\n"
"海伦一言不发的大步走过你们跟西奥的身边，朝昏暗的海岸线走去。一道浪尖打在步道上，短暂打破了僵硬的气氛。你问西奥为什么他的姊姊反应如此冷淡，他沉默地望向远方一会儿。\n"
"“你们懂的，有时候人们会渐行渐远，像是同一棵树木上的树枝，它们永远血脉相连，但朝向 — ”他的比喻被海伦打断，她在海边的洞窟口叫唤著你们。"

"As you and Helen make preparations to leave, the sound of rain breaks the silence. Theo steps through the front door, brushing his wet hair out of his face. He locks eyes with Helen. “So she’s still not back,” he says soberly. Theo drips rainwater on the weatherbeaten floor as Helen glowers at him. “I’m surprised you came, little brother. Better late than never, I guess. Get the rope.” She slings a harpoon over her shoulder and walks out into the pouring rain. Theo scrambles for rope and a second flashlight as you ask him what the matter is.\n"
"“Our sister is missing. I told Helen she would come back, and now it’s been two days. That’s, uh. That’s what the matter is.”"

"就在你们和海伦准备离开时，雨滴落下的声音打破了寂静。西奥踏进门，将被打湿的发丝拨到一边。“所以她还是没回来。”他严肃地说，一边将滴水的雨衣放在饱经风霜的地板上。海伦怒视著他：“我很惊讶你来了，弟弟。也许迟到的确比不到好吧。去拿绳子。”说完海伦便揹上一支鱼叉，走进倾盆大雨之中。西奥拖著脚步去拿绳子跟第二支手电筒时，你们问他出了什么事。\n"

"You follow Helen outside and onto the creaking boardwalks of Akwan village. Nestled in a small, rocky bay on the island’s northern shore, Akwan has been the home of Abenaki families and former whalers for generations. “Hemlock Isle isn’t safe anymore. I thought this could be our home, but I guess it’s just another stop on the way,” Helen says wistfully. The village is all but deserted, save for an old sailor in a navy blue coat. He nearly drops his fishing rod as you approach.\n"
"“Gideon! Fishing again?” Helen says with a wry smile.\n"
"The old sailor pulls his haul out of the water. “Nae but an ugly cod. An’ this e’en uglier haddock.” The fish strung through the twine have too many fins and spined, barnacle-like growths. “An ye, Helen?” Gideon asks.\n"
"Helen tells the old sailor about her missing sister. The old sailor looks concerned. “Little Lizzie’s quite the treasure. I’ll help, if ye’ll have me.”"

"你们跟著海伦走过艾湾镇破裂的滨海木板道。艾湾镇座落在岛屿北边一个窄小、岩石嶙峻的海湾中，这里世代以来都是阿本拿基族跟前补鲸人们的家。海伦伤感的说：“赫姆拉克岛已经不再安全了，我曾以为这里会是我们的家，但现在看来，它只能是个中继站了。”这个村落已经完全荒废了，只剩下一个穿著海军蓝外套的水手，你们靠近的时候，他差点把手中的鱼竿弄掉。\n"
"“吉迪恩！又来钓鱼啊？”海伦苦笑著说。\n"
"老水手把他的竿子从水中拉出“哼，只是条丑鱼，从没看过这么丑的鳕鱼。”被鱼线串起的那条鱼有著许多不正常的鱼鳍跟尖刺，类似藤壶的东西长满全身。“嗯？是海伦吗？”吉迪恩问。\n"
"海伦告诉老水手她的妹妹失踪了。老人露出担忧的表情说：“小丽莎是个好孩子，我会帮忙，如果你们愿意带我去的话。”"

msgid "You follow Helen outside and onto the creaking boardwalks of Akwan village. The night sky is dreary and overcast, but an unsettling glimmer lingers over the southern horizon: a distant, shifting luminescence of blues and greens beyond the treetops. The light forms familiar patterns: A lion’s paw, a spring blossom, a longship, and finally, a vague humanoid outline. You look down to see Helen disappearing into an inky black cave."
msgstr "你们跟著海伦走过艾湾镇破裂的滨海木板道。夜晚的天空灰蒙而沉重，但南方的地平线有微光闪烁，蓝绿色的光团在树顶远方缓慢移动，光线形成一些眼熟的图案：狮子的爪子、盛开的花朵、长船，最后组成一个模糊的人形轮廓。你们将视线拉回眼前，海伦的身影正走进洞口，消失在墨汁般漆黑的洞窟中。"
