msgid "Prelude: The Final Evening"
msgstr "序章：终夜"

msgid "A flowering procession filled with riotous, gaudy colors files through the village toward the Crossroads. There must be several hundred people here tonight, if not more. You keep pace with Dr. Marquez toward the ghoulish effigy, spinning with reflected lights. Mother Rachel stands at the center of the crowd, holding her arms out like branches before the mirrored tree."
msgstr "拥挤的人群熙熙攘攘地朝著十字路口前进，至少有几百个人，每个人身上都充满明艳的色彩。你跟著马尔克斯博士，朝著那棵令人毛骨悚然的肖像树前进，被一路上反射而来的光线弄得头晕目眩。瑞秋主母站在人群的正中央，面向挂满镜子的肖像树，如同树枝伸展般伸出双手。"

msgid "The professor strides forward, holding Rebecca’s hand. All festivities cease as Mother Rachel turns around. “Everyone listen! Last night, Mother Rachel condemned a house full of sick people to death. I was there. They were not in their right mind.” Dr. Marquez entreats the revelers. “But that’s not all. There’s something living underneath this island. It’s sucking the life out of everything around it, and could devastate this entire village. We need to leave the island at once!” Mother Rachel looks at you, wounded. “What do you accuse me of? I gave my daughter as a sacrifice, and she was given back to me.”"
msgstr "教授握著蕾贝卡的手，大步走上前。瑞秋主母转过身来，庆祝活动戛然而止。“所有人听我说！昨晚，瑞秋主母将一整屋的病人宣判死刑，我当时就在场，他们全都神智不清。”马尔克斯博士向这些狂欢者发出恳求，“不只是这样，这座岛底下生活著某种东西，它正在吸取这座岛上的一切生命，整个村庄都有可能被毁灭，我们必须立刻离开这里！”瑞秋主母用受伤的目光看著你：“你们到底在控诉我什么？我献出自己的女儿作为牺牲，现在她被归还给我了。”"

msgstr "你走上前，跪倒在瑞秋主母的脚边，马尔克斯博士看到这幕，倒抽了一大口气。主母用温暖的目光看著你说：“你将受到无尽的欢迎，盛宴将有你的一席之地。你可以坐在我的右手边，一同见证我们等待已久的奇迹。”她牢牢的紧抓你的双手，领著你加入盛宴，你顺从的跟随。"

"The professor strides forward and shouts above the revelry. “The food here is poison! You’re all in grave danger: whatever this is, it’s changing everything around it. See?” Dr. Marquez tears mask after mask off each reveler, exposing frenzied, grinning faces. The surrounding crowd goes silent. Then, a clapping sounds, along with the sound of laughter. Mother Rachel raises her arms to silence them. “Cast out these slanderers! But let it not keep us from our celebration. The heavens beckon us! Let us feast!”\n"
"The last thing you see as you are pushed away from the clamor is the matron’s triumphant smile."
msgstr ""
"教授走向陷入狂喜状态的群众，大声喊到：“这里的食物有毒！你们正处在极度的危险中：不管那是什么东西，它正在改变周遭的所有事物，看到了吗？”马尔克斯博士拉下每个狂欢者的面具，露出背后颠狂、狰狞的笑容，周围的群众一瞬间陷入寂静。接著，一阵拍手声伴随大笑声响起，瑞秋主母举起手要求静默，然后宣布：“驱逐这些造谣者！别让任何事阻止我们的庆典，天堂在召唤我们！让我们大快朵颐！”\n"

Welling up from the ground underneath...” Bertie’s eyes roll back in his head, a broad smile on his face."
msgstr "“你为什么不相信瑞秋主母呢？”柏蒂气喘吁吁地说著。舞蹈和狂欢持续进行，无人能够阻止。每个人似乎都迷失在各自的思绪中，对这位年轻人的痛苦毫无知觉。当你紧紧抱著他时，你感到一阵遗憾。柏蒂将手伸向著那颗闪烁著众多灯光的肖像树：“我能看到它即将到来。你能感觉到吗？从地下涌出……”柏蒂的眼睛上翻，脸上露出龇牙咧嘴的笑容。"

"外头的狂欢持续进行，你走进城镇大堂，发现吉迪恩坐在桌边，对面则是马尔克斯博士。“我们不该从那个船难残骸中拿走任何东西的。不该把它带回来。船员们一个接一个生病，然后死去。”他眨著眼，掉下几滴泪水。吉迪恩拿出一块小小的玻璃状岩石。“除了我们这些拥有岩石碎片的人外，其他人全都死了。这份内疚一直折磨著赫姆拉克船长，直到他生命的尽头。有一天，船长把这该死的岩石扔进村中心的井里，就在所有怪事发生之前。”\n"
