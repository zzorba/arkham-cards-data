"The path to North Point Mine runs through a narrow ravine in the heart of Pearl Ridge. With little to go on, you asked around the Vale for more information about the mine, but all you could gather were several conflicting accounts. People have gone missing in the mines recently, although the mining operation is purportedly shut down. The lichens and moss are supposedly nutritious, but some are lethal? Nobody explained why the mine shut down in the first place, either.\n"
"The path ends at the mouth of a yawning cave. Following an old rail track in, you find heaps of abandoned equipment overgrown with bright yellow fungi. The fungus looks far from edible, and emits a putrescent stench. Eventually, the tunnel opens into a massive cavern filled with luminescent mushrooms and towering crystal formations. The ground shifts with a slight tremor, followed by an echoing cry from deeper in the mine. Steeling yourself, you trek deeper into the cave. At the very least, Dr. Marquez will want samples of the strange overgrowth on the rusted equipment."

"你们知道前往北角矿坑的路要穿越珍珠山脉中央的一道狭窄的山沟，但除此之外没有其他线索。你们只好在谷地中四处询问更多关于矿坑的消息，但搜集到的讯息似乎相互矛盾。据传这座矿坑已经关闭，但最近又传出有人在其中失踪；有些消息说里面的地衣跟苔癣具有营养价值，但也有人说它们含有剧毒？最奇怪的是关于那座矿坑关闭的原因，没有人知道，或只是不愿提起。\n"
"你们朝著矿坑方向前进，最后来到一个巨口般的山洞前。你们沿著老旧的铁道进入洞口，周围四散著废弃的装备，亮黄色的菌菇生长其上，将其完全覆盖。这些菌菇看起来不适合食用，同时散发出腐臭的气息。终于狭窄的隧道引领你们来到一座宽广的洞穴，四处长满了发光的蘑菇以及高耸的水晶结构体。地面发出微微的震动，随之一阵哭声从矿洞深处回荡而来，你们安抚住自己的不安，向更深处前进。至少，对于那些在生锈工具上不自然生长的蕈菇，马尔克斯博士一定会想要一些样本。"
