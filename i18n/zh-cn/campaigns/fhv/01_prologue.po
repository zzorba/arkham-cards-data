"<blockquote><fancy>June 1926</fancy>\n"
"Miskatonic Survey, June 1926. Members Marquez, Musgrave, et alii.\n"
"After three separate reviews by Miskatonic University’s board and grant commitee, we have reached Hemlock Isle. Our driver took us across a natural land-bridge they call the “causeway”—only traversible at low tide—to a small fishing village called Akwan. Bertie showed the locals several sketches and photographs of the alkaline blossom, but the locals would have none of it. Or maybe none of him. Bertie is exceedingly chipper.\n"
"The survey consists of myself, my assistant Bertie Musgrave, and some contacts of Dr. Armitage. He insisted they accompany me as part of the terms of the grant. I just hope they don’t get in the way. The island is private property and has been off-limits to visitors for some time—until now. The locals are advertising some kind of festival throughout New England, even as far south as Boston and Arkham.\n"
"There were no lodgings in Akwan, and according to local rumors, camping on the island is a risky affair. The locals were unresponsive when I pressed further, but I was at least able to procure a map of the island as well as some basic supplies. We were all but resigned to pitching a tent west of Akwan, but then we met a young man named Theo who offered us lodging in a village called ‘Hemlock Vale’.\n"

"</blockquote>\n"
"“But really, I think you’re gonna love it here,” Theo shouts from the truck window. Dr. Marquez—athletic and well-tanned at 40—closes her survey journal and looks up at the sky. “I don’t know anyone who doesn’t love Hemlock Isle,” Theo continues. “And I don’t know why we haven’t invited folks sooner! I assume you’re here for the Feast.”\n"
"“Is this feast some sort of local tradition?” Bertie says in a crisp British accent. The breeze stirs the round man’s shock of thick hair as he leans forward eagerly.\n"
"“This is the first one ever! Everyone in the Vale’s pulled out all the stops so everyone feels welcome. We’re just so excited to have visitors!” The young man laughs as your truck crests the hilltop. Hemlock Isle stretches away in every direction.\n"
"To the south, glistening black lakes dot a tangled marsh all the way to the coast. Up north, whitecapped hills gather around jutting obsidian rocks, resembling an exposed spine. Past a huddle of hills, the dense western forest grows up the rocky hillside, bisected by a wide river. And even further north, past the white hills, is a bleak rocky coastline at the edge of the slatey Atlantic waters.\n"
"The road takes you past lush farmland into a village nestled in the hills. Gaudy floral arrangments and brilliant ribbons hang from rooftops and fenceposts. A prismatic rainbow shimmers in a cloudless sky, lending the scene an idyllic air. As the truck rolls to a stop in the crossroads, locals and children in white-gold cloaks and wooden animal masks gather around you, grinning from ear to ear.\n"
"“Willkommen!” An imposing woman with steel-gray hair and a white-gold cloak cuts through the crowd. “Welcome to Hemlock Vale. I am Mother Rachel, and these are my people. What brings you here?”"

"<blockquote><fancy>1926年6月</fancy>\n"
"1926年6月，米斯卡塔尼克大学实地调查。成员：马尔克斯、马斯格雷夫，及其他人员。\n"
"经由三个米斯卡塔尼克大学的委员会分别进行评估后，我们获准前往赫姆拉克岛进行调查。我们的向导带领我们，经由他称为“堤道”的天然陆桥，这座陆桥只有在退潮时才能通过。最后我们抵达一个叫做艾湾的小渔村。柏蒂拿著那种状似水仙的花朵的素描及照片四处询问当地人，但他们似乎没有见过这种花，或也许是因为柏蒂吓到他们了，他有点过于兴奋了。\n"
"这趟实地调查的成员有我，我的助理柏蒂．马斯格雷夫，还有一些阿米蒂奇博士的联络人，他坚持我必须带上这些人，甚至把它列为申请获准的条件之一，我只希望他们不会妨碍到我。这座岛是私人产业，而且已经禁止访客有好一阵子了，直到现在。当地人在整个新英格兰大肆宣传即将在此举办的盛大庆典，远至南方的波士顿与阿卡姆都听到了这个消息。\n"
"艾湾镇中没有可以留宿的地方，而且根据当地人的说法，在岛上野营是一件危险的事。我试著从他们口中追问更多有关危险的详情，但他们不愿再透露更多细节，不过我还是设法取得了岛上的地图，还有一些基本的补给品。我们放弃借宿的想法，准备在艾湾镇西边搭帐篷。但就在这时，一名叫做西奥的年轻男性向我们伸出援手，他说有座叫“铁杉谷”的村庄可以提供我们住宿的地方。\n"
"<right><fancy>萝莎．马尔克斯博士</fancy></right>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"“说真的，我觉得你们一定会爱上那儿的！”西奥的声音从卡车的窗户中传来。马尔克斯博士阖上她手中的调查日志，抬头看向天空，她大约40岁，皮肤黝黑，有运动员般匀称的身材。西奥继续说：“我认识的人中，没人不爱赫姆拉克岛的。我不懂为什么之前大家都不邀请人上岛，我猜你们是为了盛宴而来的对吧。”\n"
"“这个盛宴是当地的传统吗？”柏蒂用他清脆的英国腔问到。他浑圆的身体兴致勃勃地向前倾，微风吹起他一缕浓密的发丝。\n"
"“这是有史以来第一次！谷里的大家都使出了浑身解数，要让客人们感觉宾至如归，我们都很兴奋，终于有人要来拜访我们了！”年轻人说话的同时，你们的卡车正爬上一座山丘，在山丘顶，整座赫姆拉克岛尽收你们眼底。\n"
"南边，一大片植披纠缠的沼泽一路延伸到海岸线，其中有座湖泊，黑色的水面反射著光芒。北方如白浪起伏的山丘之间，一座座黑耀巨岩如脊柱般从中突出。越过西面的山丘群后，是一座广袤的森林，从砾石密布的山丘地带一路生长，中央被一道宽阔的河流一分为二。在更遥远的北方，越过白色山丘，就是岩石组成的海岸线，平静的大西洋海水拍打著荒凉陡峭的岸崖。\n"
"你们在郁郁葱葱的田园中行驶，一路驶向座落在山丘之间的村庄。你们路过精心布置的花园，屋顶与栅栏上处处可见精致的缎带装饰，一道彩虹高挂在晴朗无云的天空，形成一幅田园诗集般的美丽风景。你们的卡车在十字路口停下，当地的大人跟小孩们都穿著白金相间的外衣，戴著木制的动物面具。他们围绕在你们身边，带著灿烂的笑容欢迎你们。\n"
"“欢迎！”一名气质出众的女性从人群中走出，她有一头铁灰色的头发，同样披著白金相间的外衣。“欢迎来到铁杉谷，我是瑞秋主母，这些是我的人民。什么风把你们吹来的呢？”"

"Mother Rachel’s friendly mask breaks for just a moment as she registers your response. “Surveyers. I see. You are quite welcome here as well. But mind your place. We have rules. Do not harm anyone in the Vale and we will not harm you. Keep to the village at night, and take care out in the wilderness. Nature is crueller here.”\n"
"Down the road, a small doe walks alongside a pair of children, almost as if to contradict the matron’s words. Before you can ask her more, a gaggle of locals descend on the truck, eager for news from the mainland. After fielding multiple questions about sports outcomes and elections, Dr. Marquez suggests you split up to acquaint yourselves with the locals. “Ask around about the island and meet back here in an hour.”"
msgstr "聽到你們的來意時，瑞秋主母友善的面具有一瞬間消失了，但立刻又恢復如常。“原來是調查員，我懂了。你們同樣受到歡迎，但請注意言行，我們有自己的規矩。只要你們不對谷民們造成麻煩，我們同樣也不會對你們造成困擾。晚上最好待在村莊裡，在荒野中要小心，這裡的大自然是很嚴酷的。”在路的另一端，你們看見一隻小母鹿自在地走在兩個孩子身旁，這個畫面似乎與這位女士所說的有些出入。但在你們能進一步詢問她前，興奮的居民們已經湧了上來，迫切的想知道來自大陸上的消息。你們滿足了幾個關於運動比賽跟選舉的問題後，馬爾克斯博士提議所有人分頭行動，跟當地人們建立關係。“問問有關這座島上的事，一小時後回來這裡會合。”"

Like heavenly bodies, we each have a place in this life, a purpose. There are some whose place is to understand.

You note the worn copy of Walden under his arm, and ask about any local points of interest. “I know it’s rather unconventional, but my family’s old house has a...peculiar infestation,” he seems to chew his own words. “If you could exterminate whatever it is rather than study it, I think we’d all be in your debt.”"

"旅店的屋簷上挂满了花圈，一阵肉香从前门飘出：是肉派与啤酒的香味。店主介绍自己是奥姆斯德太太，并给了你们住宿的房间。“村里发生的大小事都逃不过我的眼睛，如果你们想多了解谷民们，我很乐意帮忙。”当你们询问啤酒是从哪来时，她轻蔑的挥挥手说：“别跟我提什么禁酒令，赫姆拉克岛有自己的规矩。”她说完后瞥了一眼门廊外面，“除非，有人太不上道。”\n"
"你们看向门廊外，有一位黑棕色皮肤的窈窕人影坐在门外，那人看不出男女，穿著一身时尚的洋装，衬金白袍随意地披在肩上，手中拿著一个刺绣圆环，正在绣著一朵花的图样。柏蒂羞涩地拿著几张吸引你们来到这的照片跟素描，上前询问。"

"Dozens of workers bustle around the base of a large tree in the center of the Crossroads. The many faces of the tree leer down at you with myriad expressions: some laughing, others pinched in grief, or terror. Each expression is grotesquely exaggerated. When you ask one of the nearby carpenters about the tree, they pause to consider their words. “This tree is the effigy. A likeness of—well, maybe it’s best to think of it as a heavenly spirit. The same spirit that lives on in each of us.”\n"

"十字路口中央有棵大树，有数十名工人在树下忙碌著。树上雕刻的无数面容充满各种表情，正居高临下看著你。有些表情在大笑，有些则因悲伤或恐惧而扭曲，但所有表情都有个共通点：它们看起来都十分怪诞且夸张。你询问一旁的木匠这棵树的由来，他们欲言又止，似乎在考虑自己的用词：“这是一座肖像，象征……呃，这样说好了，天上的圣灵，这些灵魂也同样存在于我们之中。”\n"

"The small chapel atop the Vale’s northern hill has a hushed, stately air. Small buds have been grafted in such a way as to suggest the planks themselves are blooming. While you admire the strange phenomenon, two women in white-gold cloaks approach. You ask them more about the chapel and their faith, and they usher you inside. A stylized quilt at the back portrays a warped, many-armed mythological being with numerous eyes and wings. “We built this chapel some twenty years ago, but it didn’t see much use until our revival. Mother Rachel has always called us ‘Children of the Stars.’ I suppose this is one such star.”\n"

Monopodial with dozens of different expressions. But no evidence of grafting. It grew naturally.” You ask how this is possible, and the professor grins. “It isn’t.

Bertie lights up in response. “They almost seem to be living in some transcendentalist ideal. I have no idea what they actually believe, mind you, but they seem friendly enough.”\n"

"“That sounds rather ill-natured given the celebration!” Bertie ventures. Dr. Marquez gives him a withering look. “What I mean is that they’ll disrupt the local habitats, so our time is limited. We can split up to cover more ground, or we can stick together. Theo has volunteered to drive us anywhere we need to go, and even said we could take his truck at night—though we aren’t to tell Mother Rachel. Given the stories of deadly wildlife, I’ve hired Judith to accompany me to Eastwick Bog. Either of you are welcome to join. Just be back by sundown.”\n"
