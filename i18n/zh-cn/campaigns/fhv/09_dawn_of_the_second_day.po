msgstr "马尔克斯博士从楼上出现，面色阴沉，柏蒂跟在她身后，小心地护著裹著绷带的手。回想起昨晚的经历，他的脸色依然苍白：“我在森林边缘散步，应该是正午的时候，突然我感觉一切都绝顶美味，呃。”他努力找到适当的话来表达，“一种无上的喜悦，然后我想我就迷失自己了。我回过神来时已经是晚上，而且我迷路了。现在我回来了，但还是忍不住会想起那种窒息般的感觉，就像诗人们说的‘情绪总在宁静后涌现’不是吗？”教授翻了翻白眼，但没有多做评论。"

msgstr "马尔克斯博士帮自己倒了一大杯咖啡。“我要趁著这阵清凉的雨去珍珠山脉调查，想要的话你可以一起来。”她咬了一口鸡蛋，然后皱起眉头，“这是金属的味道吗？”她小心地把口中的蛋吐到手帕上。奥姆斯德太太从厨房里出现，拿著一堆燕麦饼，为几个饥饿的客人上菜。"
