"Head spinning, you stand up in an iridescent cavern. Smooth polished walls flicker with cool blue light, reflecting nightmarish images. Twisted stalagmites furl and unfurl into spirals, reaching up toward the ceiling like the stalks of some antediluvian flora. Screams fill the air: the cavern floor is covered in revelers clutching their limbs or heads. Cracks of shining light form on their skin and grow in intensity. Everything in the shining chamber is distorted by a gelid phosphorescence. You feel as though you are breathing heavy smoke in the thick warm air.\n"
"Ephemeral forms whorl around an empyrean brilliance at the center of the chamber. Silhouetted in front of the core of pure white light is Mother Rachel, her hair unbound and floating as if in deep water. Your head pounds as you stare into the brilliance, and you look down at the cavern floor. The injured revelers have stopped moving, and have gone gray and powdery. A few are clear as glass, refracting the clear light of the abyss into prismatic arrays. Others stand, petrified, holding their arms out toward the brilliance, each face frozen in a ghoulish smile.\n"
"The sound of Mother Rachel’s laughter echoes through the chamber as the matron stares into the abyss, holding her arms up overhead. Smoke gathers around her as her body dissolves into gas. Unsure of what is happening, you run up a hill of petrified human forms toward Mother Rachel and the abyss. Bones and dessicated corpses crack underfoot as you clamber to the top. Mother Rachel looks at you, exultant, before her body sublimates into pale fire.\n"
"An all-too-familiar euphoria floods your senses as the alien light pulses and bends the chamber around it. You feel an invisible hand on your shoulder; you brush it away. Something feels different. You hold up one hand to see a small, spidery crack of light form on your palm. The fissure lengthens to creep up your wrist, then your arm. The accompanying pain sends you into a dead faint.\n"

"你头晕目眩的起身，发现自己身处一个虹彩灿烂的洞穴里。光滑的墙壁闪烁著蓝色冷光，反射出梦魇般的影像。扭曲的钟乳石形成螺旋状，向著天花板伸展，犹如某种上古植物的茎。尖叫声充斥在空气中：洞穴地板上满是抓挠著四肢或头部的狂欢者，他们的皮肤上出现闪亮的裂缝，光芒并越来越强烈。整个灿烂的洞室被一种冰冷的磷光扭曲，你感觉就像在浓厚的暖空气中呼吸著浓烟。\n"
"在洞穴中心，转瞬即逝的形体环绕著一个火焰状的光辉。在纯白色光芒的核心前，映照出瑞秋主母的轮廓，她的头发披散开来，仿佛在深水中飘动。当凝视著这光辉时，你的头剧烈阵痛，于是垂头看向洞穴地板。受伤的狂欢者停止了活动，皮肤变得灰色而粉末状，有些人甚至像玻璃一样透明，将深空的明亮光线折射成一个个虹色的阵列。其他人则僵硬地站著，将手臂伸向光辉，每一张脸都被凝固在一幅悚异的笑容中。\n"
"瑞秋主母的笑声在洞穴中回荡，她凝视著深空，双臂高举过头。烟雾围绕著她，将她的身体溶解成气体。你对现在发生的事感到疑惑，沿著一个由石化的人形构成的山丘向瑞秋主母和深空跑去。无数骸骨和干枯的尸体在脚下碎裂，你终于攀爬到山顶。瑞秋主母看著你，满脸狂喜，然后她的身体升华成苍白的火焰。\n"
"一股过于熟悉的喜乐涌上你的感官，异异样的光芒跳跃并扭曲著四周的洞穴。你感觉到一只看不见的手放在你的肩膀上，你将它拨开，却感觉手上有异样，你举起一只手，看见手掌上出现一道小小的网状裂缝，裂缝逐渐延伸，蔓延到腕部，然后是手臂。随之而来的剧痛使你昏厥了过去。\n"
"你醒来，发现自己正站在一道宽阔的裂缝前，向下俯视。你看见自己不断变扌 奂， 一隹又黑 猫、一亻立女 王、一件氵票 流 白 勺东 西、一隹又在 氵军沌 与黑日 音 中爪巴 行白 勺生牛 物。 你是言隹 ？你为亻十 么在辶言 里？"

"“I understand what it is,” Dr. Marquez says. “It’s a living being. Some primal species, or something not of this world. It was brought here— perhaps by Captain Hemlock—and burrowed deep underground, where it permeated water, soil, crops. Everything. It is inherently poisonous to everything around it. Sort of a living miasma. A barely sentient numbing sickness. It emerged from Pearl Ridge 20 years ago, but it wasn’t ready to...to leave.” The professor pulls out a phosphorescent shard. “I think it came from this. One of the original shards that brought it to the island. The being drains its host like a parasite and leaves a crystallized husk behind. Freezes it in time. And then the parasite hatches as a gas from the ‘shell,’ joining...It.”\n"

"Your surroundings are swallowed by an unspeakable brilliance. A familiar euphoria grips you as reality itself shatters around you, and you catch a fleeting glimpse of other faces: human, alien, animal. The bliss turns to excruciating pain as your body sublimates into red gas. As you scream, the thousand other faces scream with you in your mind: you realize each of them is another you in other times, other realities. The other faces refract, split in two, and fracture like a broken mirror again, as every version of you is remade into something new. And then, a warmth. A wholeness. There is no you anymore. Only color and light.\n"

The smoky human shape within the brilliant ring wavers, then merges into an undimensioned rainbow that shoots upward out of the dying fluorescence. A small shockwave knocks you prone.\n"

The silver light spirals weakly off into the distance. Your heart is heavy as you clutch Dr. Marquez’s satchel: all that is left of the professor, as far as you know.\n"
"“Is anyone down there?” calls a shaky voice. You look up to see the silhouette of one of the Vale residents, wearing a tattered white-gold cloak. They have the look of someone who has awoken from a bad dream. You hesitate, but then call back. After a minute, a thick rope drops down, and you are hauled up to stand in the splintered wreckage of Hemlock Vale. The survivors gather around you. “Please, if you can find it in your heart, forgive us,” one says. Another sheds their mask and tattered cloak. Past the edge of the crowd, you think you see a familiar rabbit mask peeking out from the shadows, but when you turn your head to look, it has already vanished."
