msgid "Scenario: The Silent Heath"
msgstr "冒险：静寂荒原"

msgid "You step out of Theo’s truck accompanied by Leah Atwood and look up at Hemlock Isle’s highest point. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill with the Vale’s cook. “There’s a reason folks don’t live here anymore. Watch yourself up here. I don’t know what lives in the caves, and I don’t intend to find out,” she says. As if in response, a strong wind blows up clouds of white ash."
msgstr "你们从西奥的卡车上下来，与你们同行的还有莉亚．阿特伍德。你们看向赫姆拉克岛的最高点，狭窄的小径一路蜿蜒而上，没入一片被柔软白沙般的灰烬所覆盖的原野。黑色的岩石错落在山丘顶端，像一排参差不齐的牙齿，你们与这位谷地的厨师一起走上山坡时，周遭弥漫著渗人的寂静。莉亚开口说：“人们不再生活在这里是有原因的，小心一点，我不知道那些山洞里住著什么东西，也没兴趣知道。”就像是要回应他的话一般，一阵强风刮来，带起了一缕白色的烟尘。"

"You step out of Theo’s truck into the pouring rain, accompanied by Dr. Marquez. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill with the professor, who wears a bright yellow and blue poncho. “If the locals are to be believed, we want to head this way,” she points up the hillside to a glimmering orchard. After hiking the steep incline, the professor lets out a gasp.\n"
"Rows of crystalline trees shimmer in the light. A crack of lightning from the southern clouds refracts a band of gorgeous, prismatic radiance through hanging apples and knotted glass trunks. Although beautiful, you can’t help but feel an anxious pang: the trees are wondrous, but they are long dead, frozen in time. Dr. Marquez begins chipping away at a young sapling with a hammer and chisel. “Fan out and explore the ruins. Leah warned me to keep clear of the ants, whatever that means. Don’t kick any anthills, I guess.” she says, already engrossed in her work."

"你们从西奥的卡车上下来，踏入滂沱的大雨中，马尔克斯博士也加入了你们的行列。你们看向赫姆拉克岛的最高点，狭窄的小径一路蜿蜒而上，没入一片被柔软白沙般的灰烬所覆盖的原野。黑色的岩石错落在山丘顶端，像一排参差不齐的牙齿，你们与教授一起走上山坡时，周遭弥漫著渗人的寂静，身著亮黄色与蓝色雨衣的教授开口说：“如果当地人的话可信，我们应该走这边。”她指向山丘边一座正在发光的果园。在攀登越过陡峭的山坡后，教授喘了一大口气。\n"
"数排水晶化的树木发出闪烁的微光，南方的雨云打出一道闪电，光芒反射在高挂树梢的果实与树干的木瘤上，散发出璀璨绚丽的棱光。即使眼前的景象光彩夺目，你们还是不免感到一丝焦躁的疑虑：这些树木的确是一大奇观，但它们已经死亡很久了，被冻结了时间。\n"
"马尔克斯博士拿出槌子跟凿子，开始在一棵小树苗上采取样本。“分头行动，探索这片遗迹。莉亚警告我要离蚂蚁远一点，不知道她是什么意思，不要踩到到蚁窝吧，我猜。”她说完后就埋头专注在她手边的工作。"

msgid "You step out of Theo’s truck and look up at Hemlock Isle’s highest point. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill and spot a robed figure standing on a jutting rock, staring down at Hemlock Isle. You recognize the figure as Mother Rachel as you draw closer. She nods as if to acknowledge your presence, then spreads her arms in an exultant pose. The sky overhead shimmers with a band of strange colors."

msgid "You step out of Theo’s truck and look up at Hemlock Isle’s highest point.

msgstr "你们从西奥的卡车上下来，看向赫姆拉克岛的最高点，狭窄的小径一路蜿蜒而上，没入一片被柔软白沙般的灰烬所覆盖的原野，在月光的照耀下变成一片明亮的银白世界。黑色的岩石错落在山丘顶端，像一排参差不齐的牙齿。走上山坡时，周遭的寂静让你们感到奇异的安抚感，头顶有数道鲜艳的彩光划过满天星斗的夜空。"

msgid "You reach the old Pearl Estate and stop yourself from walking into the yawning dark chasm in front of the dilapidated house. A shattered rooftop at the northern end of the estate tells a story of some violent impact: judging by the scattered boards, something shot out of the interior with the force of a cannonball. As you survey the ruins, you wonder what awful catastrophe befell the Pearl family. A skittering black shadow flits at the edge of your vision. When you turn to look, it has gone."
msgstr "你们来到珍珠庄园，在破旧宅邸如血盆大口般黑暗的裂缝前停下脚步。宅邸北边的屋顶碎裂，显示这里曾经受到剧烈的冲击。从四散的碎片来看，有东西从建物内部炸了出来，力道堪比加农砲的砲弹。你们边探查废墟，边疑惑到底降临到帕洛一家头上的是多大的一场灾难。突然有道黑影从你们的视野边缘一闪而过，但回头时它早已消失了。"

The insect colony keeps its young in this tunnel to mature. Judging by the gory and dessicated remains on the floor, the older brood soldiers feed them with a steady supply of local wildlife and anyone foolish enough to venture into their caves."
msgstr "一股恶心的恶臭从坑道传来，坑道里爬满了肥大的白色幼虫。这些怪物般巨大的幼虫用牠们乳白色的眼睛空洞地从黑暗中盯著你们。看来这些昆虫把这条坑道当成幼虫的发育室，从地上四散的血腥腐败的遗体来看，成虫通常用当地的野生动物作为幼虫的养料，偶尔还有几个愚蠢到在牠们洞窟里闲晃的人类。"

The air is sharp with a bitter, alkaline taste, mixed with a repugnant musky scent. Several dessicated corpses—some of them human—litter the floor, overgrown with salt. Perhaps the local creatures use the salt in this chamber as a natural preservative. A pantry, of sorts."
msgstr "隧道旁一道狭窄的裂缝引领你们到了一个宽敞的洞窟，盐晶体从洞顶跟地板上生长而出，晶体上有蜘蛛网般细致的图纹。空气中弥漫带苦的咸味，还有令人反胃的麝香味。几具腐烂的尸体，其中有些属于人类，四散在地上，被盐覆盖。也许这里的生物利用这个洞穴当作天然的防腐室，某种储藏室之类的。"

Innumerable insects hang from the walls and bask on the floor in pale, watery light that filters down from a hole in the ceiling. You realize the opening above is the massive chasm in front of the Pearl Estate. A low, subsonic hum permeates the room. You feel as though you have entered a sacred space."
msgstr "你们进入一个长满乳白色水晶的巨大洞窟，约有一座露天剧场的大小。无数的昆虫挂满洞壁和舖满地板，沐浴在从洞顶裂缝透射而下，苍白水润的光芒中。你们注意到那就是珍珠庄园门前的裂缝。低沉的低频嗡声充斥整个洞穴，你们感觉自己彷佛踏进了某种圣地。"

What are they saying to each other in their own alien language? Do they know about the world beyond the heath? You shudder when you wonder how many more lurk in the caverns below."
msgstr "你们筋疲力尽的走下斜坡，背后传来无数蛸翅振动的声音，苍白、半透明的昆虫覆盖了丘顶黑色的岩石，不断发出嗡嗡声。牠们到底用自己奇异的语言在沟通些什么？牠们知道荒原之外还有一个迥然不同的世界吗？你们怀疑地底的洞窟中还有多少牠们的同类，想到这里，你们不禁打了个冷颤。"

At midnight, I awoke to the uncanny feeling of being watched, and when I opened my eyes, I saw a pale sphere of watery light in the corner of my room, dancing like something in a faery story. As soon as I laid eyes on it, the thing flew out the window, and I followed it out into the orchard. What I saw is something I can only describe as a miracle: A hundred more faery lights danced in the orchard. As I watched the lights, they grew brighter, and I felt almost as though I was flying. A heady bliss took over my mind, and I felt different, somehow. As if there were another me—five other me’s—beating within my chest. And as I looked out at the trees, I saw myself in them, too. In all of this. Strong and thick with knotted skin and branches for arms. I saw myself, my place, in all of creation. And all of my fears—for Ezra, for the mine, for our health—melted away. I knew only joy. Such joy!\n"
