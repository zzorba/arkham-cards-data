"To the office of Dr. Henry Armitage,\n"
"The survey of Hemlock Isle has concluded without Dr. Marquez. What we found there on that desolate island defies reason. An alien presence dominated the local ecosystem, warping the physical and mental wellbeing of every living thing in its proximity. We witnessed species that have never been documented before, and likely never will be again. The locals coexisted with this presence for decades, seemingly or intentionally unaware of its degenerative effects. Some even worshiped it. We count ourselves lucky to have survived.\n"
"Dr. Marquez, unfortunately, was not so lucky. Enclosed with this letter is a comprehensive account detailing her observations of this unique ecosystem. What it does not contain is the story of how—and how bravely—she gave her life. That is a story we wish to share with you in person. We ask, out of respect for her memory, that you not dismiss these records as mere fantasy. Faithfully yours,\n"

"赫姆拉克岛的调查已经完成，但马尔克斯博士却未能回来。在那个荒凉的岛屿上，我们发现了令人难以置信的事物。一个外星存在支配著当地生态系统，扭曲每一个与之接触的生物的身心健康。我们目睹了从未被记录过的物种，很可能永远不会再次被目击。当地居民与这个存在共存了数十年，似乎或有意地忽视了它造成的突变性退化，有些人甚至崇拜它。我们很幸运才能幸存下来。\n"
"不幸的是，马尔克斯博士没有分享到这份幸运。这封信附上了她对这个独特生态系统的详细观察报告。但其中并未记录她是如何，以及多么勇敢地献出自己的生命，这是我们希望亲自向您分享的故事。为了尊重博士的牺牲，我们请求您，希望您不要将这些记录视为纯粹的幻想。\n"
"致上最诚恳的问候。\n"

"The survey of Hemlock Isle has concluded at great cost. Over the course of our three day excursion, we witnessed horrors and wonders that defy all reason. A parasitic life form unlike any other fed on the local ecosystem, warping the biology of every living thing around it. I have enclosed a comprehensive account of the phenomena we witnessed, along with samples, notes, and sketches.\n"
"Although I was initially wary of your contacts, they provided invaluable support throughout the survey. Ultimately, the strange gaseous entity we discovered took their lives. Without their sacrifice, I would have perished, along with most of Hemlock Isle.\n"
"I will explain everything in further detail upon my return.\n"

"赫姆拉克岛的调查已完成，却付出极大代价。在三天的考察过程中，我们目睹了一切理性都无法解释的恐怖和奇观。一种前所未见的寄生生物以当地的生态系统为养分，扭曲著周围每一个生物的生物特征。我在此附上了我们目睹的现象的详细报告，以及样本、笔记和素描。\n"
"虽然一开始我对您的联络人们抱持怀疑态度，但在整个调查过程中，他们提供了宝贵的支援。最终，我们发现的奇异气体实体夺走了他们的生命。如果没有他们的牺牲，我和大半个赫姆拉克岛上的生物都将失去生命。\n"
"一切细节待我返归后详细向您解释。\n"

My friends in New York are already whispering about my fall from grace,” River says bitterly. William regards his cousin. “I think it’s time I returned to society. I’m sure I can set your friends right.” River pauses, then smirks as an idea comes to them. “Oh, William. My friends will love you. All you need to do is share one of your poems.

"Judith’s hunting jacket is splattered with blood and her hair is a mess as she approaches you, rifle slung over her shoulder. She looks down at her jacket when she sees your concern. “Oh, don’t worry. You should see the other guy,” she winks. You ask if she’s still going to Boston, and she shrugs. “Maybe, maybe not. I was gonna ask where you’re headed next.”\n"
"You tell her you’re headed to Arkham, and she suppresses a snort of disbelief. “Arkham, huh? The city that’s in the news with weird shit every other week? You’re really headed back there?” She goes quiet for a moment as if considering something. “You’re going to need someone to watch your back,” she ventures. You tell her you plan to take a long rest, and she smirks. “I’ve got a buddy who runs a speakeasy somewhere in Easttown. After everything we’ve been through, I’d say I owe you a drink.”"

"茱蒂丝的狩猎夹克上沾满了鲜血，头发凌乱，肩膀上挂著步枪。当她走近，看到你关切的神情时，她低头看了看自己的夹克，冷冷一笑说：“哦，别担心。你应该看看另一个家伙的惨状。”她眨著眼向你使个眼色。你问她是否仍打算前往波士顿，她耸耸肩：“也许，也许不。我本来是要问问你接下来打算去哪。”\n"
"你告诉她你打算前往阿卡姆，她忍不住轻笑：“阿卡姆啊？那个每两周就有怪事登上新闻的城市？你真的要回去？”她静静沉思片刻，似乎在考虑著什么。“你需要有人帮你守著背后。”她陡然说到。你告诉她你打算好好休息一段时间，她得意地笑了笑：“我有个朋友在东城区经营一家地下酒吧。经历了这一切，我想我欠你一杯。”"

When you ask him why, he looks down. “I really don’t know why.” He pauses to think, then goes on. “I always wanted a place that...that felt like home again. After mom and pop passed, Helen got—she got tough. And then I started to help out around the Vale, and they didn’t care how tough I was. It felt like home. And now that’s gone too.” He blinks tears from his eyes. “I guess home is what you make it. You should come visit us in Portland some time. I know you’ll love it,” he smiles."
msgstr "西奥脸上露出一个害羞的笑容，当你走近他，他用力地拥抱了你一下。当他放开你时，你看到他哭了。当你问他为什么时，他低头看著地面：“我真的不知道原因。”他停下来思考，然后继续说到：“我一直希望有个感觉像家的地方。在爸妈过世后，海伦变得更……强了。然后我开始在谷地帮忙，这里的人不在乎我坚不坚强，感觉就像在家一样，而现在这一切也消失了。”他眨掉眼眶中的泪水，“但我想家是要自己去创造的。你该来波特兰拜访我们，我知道你会喜欢的。”他微笑著说。"
