msgid "Prelude: The Second Evening"
msgstr "序章：次夜"

msgid "The rain continues through the day. When you arrive at the Commons for dinner, the tables have been pushed to the sides of the room and warm lamps are hung from colorful ribbons. Dozens of new faces peer out from the crowd of cloaked locals: visitors from the mainland. A large sculpture looms in the center of the room, festooned with violet and white blossoms that seem to palpitate in the soft light. The room goes silent as Mother Rachel addresses the assembly. “Friends. Brethren. Each of you is a miracle of time and light. You are the promise of your true self—” The matron stops mid-sentence."
msgstr "雨下了一整天，你们抵达城镇大堂用晚餐时，看见所有桌子都被推到一旁，温暖的灯笼悬挂在鲜艳的彩带上。除了穿著罩袍的当地人，还有数十张新面孔穿梭其间，是来自大陆的客人。一座雕塑伫立在大堂中央，用紫罗兰跟白色的花朵点缀著，在柔和的光线下令人心中悸动。瑞秋主母向所有人问候时，大堂中安静了下来：“朋友们，兄弟姐妹们，你们每个人都是时间与光明的奇迹，你们都为真实的自我许下了承诺 — ”修女长停顿了一下。"

msgid "<i>If Simeon survived</i> is recorded in Simeon Atwood’s Notes:"
msgstr "如果西缅．阿特伍德的笔记中有记录<i>西缅活下来了</i>："

msgid "A shadow passes over the matron’s face as she sways, looking for a moment as though she might faint. The air in the room swirls thickly. Oily patterns dance in the light as you feel a now-familiar light-headedness. Someone steps forward to help Mother Rachel, but she holds up one hand and steadies herself."
msgstr "她的脸上闪过一道阴影，身形不稳的摇晃著，像是下一刻就会晕厥一样。大堂中的空气突然变得凝重，光线中似乎有什么图案在舞动，像是水面上的油渍，你感觉到一股熟悉的目眩感。有些人上前想扶住瑞秋主母，但她用一只手及时稳住了自己。"

msgid "A sturdy figure cuts through the crowd. “Has anyone seen Simeon?” Leah Atwood asks in a trembling voice. She looks at the assembly with wide, searching eyes. “Please. Simeon. Now’s not the time for pranks,” she addresses her son, but to no response. The air in the room swirls thickly. “Enough,” Mother Rachel shoos her sister away. Oily patterns dance in the light as you feel a now-familiar light-headedness."
msgstr "一个身材结实的身影穿过群众，一边大喊著：“有人看到西缅吗？”莉亚．阿特伍德颤抖地发问，她睁大眼睛看向人群，搜寻著儿子的身影，“拜托，西缅，现在不是恶作剧的时候。”她呼唤著儿子的名字，但没有任何回应。大堂中的气氛突然凝重起来。“够了。”瑞秋主母出声阻止她的妹妹。，光线中似乎有什么图案在舞动，像是水面上的油渍，你感觉到一股熟悉的目眩感。"

So on this night, let us dance.” The assembly bursts into rapturous applause. A ragtag band in the corner starts playing as the dance begins. Several friendly faces beckon you to join."
msgstr "瑞秋主母重拾镇定，开口宣布：“今晚是一年中最短的一夜，而明天我们将迎接永恒的开端，所以今晚让我们尽情舞蹈吧！”群众爆发出欣喜万分的掌声，角落中的乐队用五花八门的乐器开始奏乐，有几张友善的脸孔邀请你加入舞会。"

msgid "You may choose whom you would like to dance with. One at a time, each investigator may choose a different codex entry from the following (if there is only one investigator, you may choose two to resolve instead). If a resident’s name is crossed out, you cannot choose their codex."
msgstr "你可以选择要与谁共舞。一次一位，每位调查员可以从以下的圣典条目中选择一个条目，不可重复。(如果游戏中只有一位调查员，你可以改为结算两个条目)。如果该住民的名字已经被划掉，你不能选择对应的条目。"

msgid "The Vale’s matriarch stands apart from the throng, arms crossed. Tears glisten on her cheeks as she watches the room. You approach and ask her to dance. “I’m sorry. I can’t,” she replies. The strain in her voice is evident, and you ask what the matter is. “We are called to give up many things in this life. I only pray that what we gain is worth the cost.”"
msgstr "谷地的领导人站在离人群有段距离的地方，双手抱胸。她的目光投向大堂中的人们，脸上的泪痕晶亮可见。你上前邀请她共舞，“抱歉，我不行。”她回应，声音中的紧绷清晰可闻，你询问是否有什么问题。“我们被要求放弃此生的许多东西，我只希望最后的回报能值得这些付出。”"

msgstr "你发现莉亚站在餐桌旁，双手颤抖。“西缅最近一直提到什么‘矿工俱乐部’，我在想他会不会 — ”她的脸色瞬间苍白，“抱歉，我现在不能跳舞。”"

msgid "Leah steps out onto the wooden floor with you and dances along. Although she can’t quite keep step with the music, she sweeps you off your feet with surprising ease and spins you around. The others cheer as you take a bow."
msgstr "莉亚跟著你踏上木制地板，与你一同起舞。虽然她跟不太上拍子，但她踏著从容的舞步，与你一同旋转，让你十分惊艳。当你们鞠躬致意时，众人拍手欢呼。"

msgstr "“我已经好几年没跳过舞，疏于练习了，但有何不可呢？”威廉跟你一起走进舞池，跳起了华尔滋。你们绊倒了几次、出丑了几次，终于提早将这支舞跳完了。这位年长的赫姆拉克家族后裔带著愉快的心情走回了角落。"

msgstr "“好啊，但我只跳《洋基歌》。”吉迪恩露出一个开朗的笑容，彷佛年轻了几岁。你走到乐团那点歌，走回舞池时，你看见老水手已经随著音乐开始摇摆了。“我的姪女葛莉菈很爱这首歌，我有好几年没见过她了……。”"

When you open them, you are lying on the floor. Several dancers stand around you, and someone helps you to your feet."
msgstr "你随著音乐起舞，昏暗的光线在所有人脸上投下柔和的暗色阴影，户外的天空渐渐暗了下来。一种几乎有触感的存在像毯子般覆盖了整座大堂，在跳舞的人群之间移动，迟缓了你的感官。你闭上眼睛仔细感受这种感觉，当你重新睁开眼睛，你已经躺在地上了，几名舞者站在你身旁，有人伸出手将你扶起来。"

Dr. Marquez signals you to join her at the side of the room. “There’s something very wrong here,” she says in a low voice. “There are maybe a dozen members of the Vale who have disappeared—some even in the last few days. Mother Rachel seems blissfully unconcerned. And then there are these ‘wonders’ everyone talks about. I’m starting to suspect the ‘wondrous’ feeling here isn’t just hypoxia.” You mention your own dizziness and strange euphoria over the past few days."
msgstr "傍晚过了一半后，舞池中逐渐平静了下来，雨滴打在房顶上，昏暗大堂内的舞者们像烟雾般轻轻晃动。马尔克斯博士用手势示意你到外面来。“这里非常不妥。”她压低声音说到，“至少有十几个谷地的居民消失了，有些甚至是在最近几天不见的。瑞秋主母看起来完全不担心。还有每个人口中的‘奇迹’，我开始怀疑这种‘神奇’的感觉不只是简单的缺氧症状。”你提到自己在最近几天也感受到晕眩感和奇异的快感。"

msgid "The professor hands you Susan Pearl’s diary. “Thank you for recovering this, by the way. It’s a fascinating read. In the last year of her life, Madame Pearl was wracked by hallucinations and a chronic wasting disease. Whatever it is, it incites rapid mutation before breaking down muscles, organs, and cognitive function. Reading between the lines, I get the impression the entire Pearl family was similarly affected prior to the incident that devastated the ridge.”"

"You share your own observations of Hemlock Isle. More than just ‘wonders,’ the creatures here are either sickly and malnourished, or aggressively vivacious. Dr. Marquez nods along. “Everything is affected. Sickly. Starving. Mutating. And it’s all highly localized. There are no reports of these strange phenomena elsewhere. It’s only here.” She produces a creased map of the island and points to the north hills. “Pearl Ridge hasn’t recovered in the past twenty years since it was obliterated.”\n"
"Marquez holds up two rings of glassy wood from both Eastwick Bog and Pearl Orchard, then draws a ring around Pearl Ridge on her map. “The bitter eggs this morning reminded me of a report after the Tunguska event. A meteorite obliterated miles of Russian countryside, but the effects on the locals were even more devastating. Stores of food were poisoned. Livestock perished. Nearby villages were slowly deserted as families who lived there for generations died of starvation or worse.” She draws a larger concentric circle around the first.\n"
"“Nobody has said anything about a meteor, but judging by the massive sinkhole in front of the Pearl Estate, something emerged from the rock. My working theory is that the mining operation opened a vein and released whatever poisoned gas or mineral affecting the island.”\n"
"Dr. Marquez’s expression goes grave. “There’s something else. Something we shouldn’t discuss here. Follow me.” As you follow the professor out of the Commons, a stout figure bumps into you."

"马尔克斯博士在地图上圈起位于东方沼泽和珍珠果园的晶化树林，接著在珍珠山脉上也画了一个圈：“今天早上那些带苦味的蛋让我想起了通古斯事件的后续报告。一颗小陨石坠落在俄罗斯的乡间，摧毁了范围好几哩的地区，然而它对当地人造成的伤害甚至更大。储存的粮食变质、牲畜死亡，周遭的村庄渐渐荒废，世代居住在那里的人们因饥饿或更糟的原因逐渐死亡。”她一边说，一边在刚才的圆圈外又画了一个更大的同心圆。\n"
"“没人提到关于陨石的事，但根据珍珠庄园外那个巨大的沉洞来看，有某种东西从岩石中涌了出来。我目前的理论是采矿工作意外打通了一条通道，把不知道是有毒的气体还是矿物释放了出来，影响到整座岛屿。”\n"

They told me there will be more dancing later, in the crossroads, and a large bonfire.”\n"

I tried to take shelter at the old Atwood Farm, but it was boarded up. Windows and doors. It smelled something awful. I’m not even sure what I heard coming from inside,” she says soberly. When you ask her to explain, she shakes her head.\n"
