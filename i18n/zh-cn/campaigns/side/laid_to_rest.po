"The dead don’t rest. No matter where you go, you hear them talking, whispering, weeping, screaming. Sometimes to each other, sometimes alone. They ramble on about the people they loved, or their job, or the money they hid under the floorboards before they died. Usually it’s about food or drink. The dead are always hungry. Sometimes when they realize you can hear them, they crowd ’round real close and whisper in your ear. Last wishes and such. You try to help when you can, but usually the folks they want you to take care of are dead, too. You make a lot of empty promises, but at least it keeps them quiet.\n"
"It wasn’t always this way. The dead started talking the day your father died in his shotgun house in the French Quarter. You saw him standing over his own body in the living room when you came home; he vanished before you could say a word. From then on, whenever you played your father’s trumpet, you could hear a cacophany of voices. Some of them were human. But there were others, too. Piercing wails from inhuman lips. Gutteral cries. And a crowd of shimmering, spectral faces peering out from the shadows.\n"
"Jean helped you make sense of it all. He stopped to listen to you busking on a Bourbon Street corner and noticed the long look you gave to the ghost lying at your feet. He saw it too. Jean introduced himself as a medium and told you to meet him at his shop in Broadmoor. He told you all about the dead, and the things beyond the grave, and the price you’d pay if you kept company with ’em for too long.\n"
"It was the dead who led you to Arkham. You eke out a living playing your father’s trumpet. The dead get louder when you play. Sometimes they even compliment your music. Last night, Jean found you busking outside the Clover Club, almost like the first time you met. You could tell something was wrong: his face was haggard, and he looked like he hadn’t slept for days. Jean tells you that your father wants to see you, and that you need to go where the boundary between here and thereafter is thin. You tell him you know just the place. Hangman’s Hill is rife with spirits. Maybe if you do them a few favors, they’ll do you one in return."

"死者并不安息。无论你去到哪里，你都听到它们说话、低语、哭泣、尖叫。有时对著彼此，有时则是独自。它们喃喃不休地谈论它们所爱的人、它们的工作，或者它们死前藏在楼板底下的钱。常常与食物或饮料有关，死者总是饥饿的。有时，当它们意识到你能听见它们的声音时，它们就会紧紧地围在你身边，在你耳边低语最后的愿望等等。你试著尽力提供帮助，但通常它们希望你帮助的对象也已经死了。你做了很多空洞的承诺，至少能让它们安静下来。\n"
"好景不常，从你父亲死在法兰西区的猎枪小屋里的那一天起，死者就开始说话了。你回到家时，在客厅里看到你父亲站在自己的尸体上；你还来不及说话，他就消失了。从那时起，每当你吹奏父亲的小号时，你都会听到不和谐的声音。一些是人的声音，也有一些其他的声音；非人般的嘴唇发出刺耳的哀嚎、喉音的哭喊、还有一群微微发光的幽灵脸孔从阴影中窥探。\n"
"帮助你了解这一切的是尚。当你在波旁街转角处表演时，他停下来听并注意到你长长地看了躺在你脚下的鬼魂一眼。他也看得到。尚介绍自己是灵媒，并要你去他位于布罗德莫的商店与他见面。他告诉你所有关于死者以及坟墓彼端的事情，还有如果你与他们相处太久，会付出什么代价。\n"
"让你来到阿卡姆的原因也是死者。你靠著演奏父亲的小号勉强维持生计。当你演奏时，死者的声音变得更大声。有时它们甚至会欣赏你的音乐。昨晚，你在四叶草俱乐部外面街头表演时遇到尚，就像你们第一次见面一样。但你发现有些不对劲：他脸色憔悴，样子看起来像是好几天没睡觉。尚告诉你，你的父亲想见你，为此你需要去一个现世与彼端之间界线很薄弱的地方。你告诉他你知道这样的地方：绞刑者山丘上充斥著鬼魂。如果你帮它们一些忙，也许它们也会给你一些回报。"

"Phantasmagoric shapes form and recede in the mist around you. As you take Jean’s hands, the medium falls into a dead faint. In the dark, you glimpse your father’s face: his laugh lines, his kind eyes, his smile. Your father is with you at last.\n"
"The moment is broken by a sudden, gasping breath as Jean awakens. Before you can react, your father’s face winks out of sight, leaving you alone. Despite the knot in your stomach, you feel a sense of relief in knowing that your father was here, however briefly, and that he saw you. As you help Jean to his feet, you hear your father’s voice in your ear, whispering encouragement over the riot of ghosts bickering in your ears. You hope he never goes quiet."
