msgstr "“蜂拥X”关键词表示一群敌人集体行动，带有“蜂拥X”关键词的敌人入场后，将你的牌堆顶上的X张卡牌放到该敌人下面，作为蜂拥卡牌，但不要查看卡牌内容。蜂拥卡牌上面的敌人称为“头领敌人”。某些冒险卡的效果可能会指示玩家将蜂拥卡牌添加到一个敌人处，这一流程与蜂拥关键词敌人入场的流程一样。"

msgid "Each swarm card can be attacked or dealt damage separately, but the host enemy cannot be defeated while it still has swarm cards underneath it. When a swarm card is defeated, any excess damage may be dealt to another swarm card underneath the same host enemy or to the host enemy itself. <i>(For example, Tony Morgan uses a .41 Derringer to attack a Stealthy Zoog with 2 swarm cards. The attack deals 2 damage. The first point of damage defeats 1 of the 2 swarm cards, so the excess point of damage may be dealt to another swarm card, defeating it as well.)</i>"

"Over a decade after the Great War, another kind of war has come to Earth—a conflict wrought by factions long hidden in the shadows of society.\n"
"It began with the murders in Arkham—over a dozen bodies in half as many days. The police thought the perpetrator to be a serial killer at first, until the sixth victim's corpse turned up as a mangled heap of meat and viscera, like a meal chewed up and spit back out. No human could have performed such a grisly murder.\n"
"When similar killings started to sprout up in other cities across North America, you sought to uncover the truth. A serial killer could not be in Arkham, Providence, Montréal, and New York City all at once. This had to be the work of an organization. But that wasn't all you discovered: there were commonalities between many of the victims, sorting them into three distinct groups.\n"
"In Providence, many victims were older and well-educated. In Montréal, those killed lived in the woods outside the city, or had professions dealings with nature or biology in some capacity. In New York, bodies turned up deep in the sewers and underground subway tunnels, their identities shrouded in mystery.\n"
"You have spent the past few weeks trying to unearth the truth behind these murders and the various factions carrying them out. In this time, the conflict has grown exponentially. Massacres. Bombings. Sightings of strange ceremonies in the streets. Entities blotting out the stars in the night sky. Swarms of locust-like insects devouring people whole. Mutated lizard creatures prowling the sewers. And worse yet, while Arkham seems to be conflict's epicenter, these incidents are spreading all across the world.\n"
"This is no ordinary war, and not one the authorities can deal with. You are the only one who suspects the truth. Somehow, you have to find out what these factions are fighting over, and put a stop to the conflict before it consumes the entire world in its madness."

"当北美其他城市也开始发生类似的凶杀案，你试图揭开真相。一个连环杀手不可能同时出现在阿卡姆、普罗维登斯、蒙特利尔和纽约。这一定是团伙作案。但你还有别的发现：众多受害者之间存在一些共同点，可以据此把他们分成3个不同的群体。\n"
"在普罗维登斯，受害者多是受过良好教育的老年人。在蒙特利尔，死者生前居住在城市以外的树林里，或者生前从事与自然或生物有关的职业。在纽约，尸体发现于下水道和地铁隧道的深处，身份依然成谜。\n"
"在过去的几周里，你一直在努力挖掘这些谋杀案背后的真相，找出行凶的各个阵营。最近，这些阵营之间剑拔弩张。屠杀。爆炸。街上目击到的诡异仪式。夜空中遮蔽星辰的存在。像是蝗虫的虫群把人吃个精光。变异的蜥蜴类生物在下水道里爬行。更糟糕的是，虽然阿卡姆看起来是冲突的中心，但这些事件正在全世界扩散。\n"

msgstr "这头野兽的横冲直撞无法阻挡，只有你知道如何才能击败它。它穿过大陆和海洋，沿路的城市接连崩塌。军队均被消灭。政府纷纷倒台。阿卡特教团孕育出来的怪物仍未停止他们贪婪的征战，直到地球上除了辽阔的废土与人类文明摇摇欲坠的废墟之外，再没有东西可供他们支配。他们甘愿为之牺性的“乐园”已经到来。"
