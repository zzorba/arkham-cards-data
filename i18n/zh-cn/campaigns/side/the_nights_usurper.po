"Winlock fiddles with his mustache for a moment while he considers your words. As the leader of the expedition currently scouring through Dashur, the decision of whether or not to let you join the expedition is up to him. “Look, I read through the evidence you gathered. I know about what happened in Cairo. I believe your story. But, still…” He lets out an exasperated sigh. “I just don’t know how I’m going to convince the rest of the expedition crew. Ancient temples is one thing, but a gate to another dimension? This ‘Xzharah’ fellow? None of this can be real, right?”\n"
"Your research and your experience says otherwise. The threat is real. There is a secret organization operating within Egypt—The Brotherhood of the Beast—and if they are not stopped, their newfound “Chosen One” will begin a campaign of destruction that ends with the Earth.\n"
"You insist one last time to be allowed access to the expedition’s resources. “Alright, alright,” Winlock relents. “I don’t know what it is you’re looking for out there in the desert, but I hope you find it.” You shake your head in reply. You’d rather come up empty‑handed."

"温洛克摩挲著自己的胡子，思索著你的话。身为本次勘察代赫舒尔的领队，你能不能加入探险队完全取决于他。“瞧，你这些证据我都看了。我知道开罗发生了什么。我也相信你说的。可是……”他恼火地叹了一声，“我只是不知道要怎么说服探险队的其它人。古代神庙是一回事，但要说通往另一个维度的入口？这个称为伊扎法拉的家伙？这些都不可能是真的，对吧？”\n"
"但你的研究和经验得出的答案并不是这样。威胁是确实存在的。这个神秘组织——恶兽兄弟会——在全埃及活动，要是不阻止他们，他们新发现的“天选”就会带来毁灭，危害整个地球。\n"
"你又坚持了一次，一定要探险队对你打开大门。“好吧，好吧。”温洛克最终还是服软了。“我不知道你到底要在沙漠里找什么，但我希望你能找到它。”你摇摇头作为回应。那你情愿空手而归。"

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Khopesh of the Abyss, Summoned Nightgaunt, the single-sided Eldritch Gate location, the double-sided Xzharah enemy, each of the 5 double-sided [[Otherworld]] locations, and both copies of Dreaded Shantak.

"“It’s just an arch. Why’re you so worked up, boss?” Winlock crossed his arms. Something about all of this felt wrong. He was sure that this was the place those folks from Arkham were looking for—a delicately patterned archway that led nowhere at all—and yet, Winlock was certain there was something <i>on the other side</i>. “It’s not Egyptian,” he noted, staring at the thing with narrow eyes. “It doesn’t even look…human.”\n"
"“You believed those loons? Look boss, it’s nothing!” one of his men laughed.\n"
"“Is it?” Winlock snapped, eyes wide. “Is it?”"

"“这就是个拱门。你干嘛这么激动，老大？”温洛克叉著手。这东西浑身上下都透著一股不对劲。他确信这地方就是那群阿卡姆来的人要找的地方——绘有精妙图文的拱门——很明显不通往任何地方——但是，温洛克确定在另一端一定有著什么。“这不是埃及的东西。”他眯起眼凝视著拱门，“这看起来甚至都不是……不是人类的东西。”\n"
"“你相信那些傻瓜？看啊老大，<b>这什么都不是！</b>”其中一个队员笑道。\n"
"“嗯？”温洛克瞪大了眼睛厉声说道，“是吗？”"

msgid "The essence fades from Xzharah’s body. Swirling clouds of mist surround him and force him to his knees. Creatures of the abyss appear wordlessly at your side, surrounding Xzharah with a quiet, expressionless hate. Xzharah’s sword betrays him and falls from his grip, the blade fracturing as it clatters to the ground. “…The prophecy must be fulfilled…” It is the last of his vile whispers. His physical form vanishes into the realm’s ethereal mist, and all is silent in the Great Abyss."
msgstr "伊扎法拉的实体开始消散。团团云雾环绕著他，迫使他跪下。深渊的生物无声无息地出现在你周围，带著寂静而面无表情的恨意包围住了伊扎法拉。就连伊扎法拉的剑都不听他的使唤，掉在了地上，剑刀碎裂开来。“预言必须被实现……”这是伊扎法拉邪恶声音留下的最后一句。他的实体消散在这片领域的薄雾中。大深渊里只留一片寂静。"

msgid "Xzharah places an ice-cold hand on your shoulder as you kneel before him. “You have proven your loyalty,” he decrees. Creatures of the abyss surround you, heads bowed in reverence to their new master. There are none left to oppose him. “Few of your kind have the wit or the will to see beyond the present. To see our prophecy fulfilled. But you are worthy enough to have your eyes opened. Far worthier than the fools I have trusted in the past.” He bids you to stand, and places the handle of his blood-soaked sword in your hands. “Now arise, Servant of the Beast, and take your place among us.”"
msgstr "你跪在伊扎法拉面前，他将冰冷的手放在你肩上。“你已经证明了自己的忠诚。”他宣布道。深渊中的生物环绕著你，低头向新主人致意。再也没有谁敢反抗他了。“你的族裔中很少有人能具备足够的智慧或意志能看到未来。看到我们的预言实现。但你很有价值，打开了自己的眼界。比我过去信任的蠢货都更有价值。”他让你站起身，将自己那把染血弯剑的剑柄交到了你的手里，“现在起身吧，恶兽之仆。你在我们之中赢得了一席之地。”"
