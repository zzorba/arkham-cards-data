"The newspaper headline reads, \"Local scientists win Nobel Prize!\" Below it, two elderly physicists are pictured standing proudly in front of a large telescope. You glance at the newspaper's date, your jaw agape. This issue of the <i>Arkham Advertiser</i> is dated December 5, 1956. But how is this possible?\n"
"Surprised and curious, you eagerly read the entire newspaper and learn of two remarkable scientists and their journey to winning a Nobel Prize in physics.\n"
"Born in 1877 in Arkham to Irish immigrants, Thomas Corrigan's earliest memory is when his crayons, left on an outdoor table, melted together under the hot summer sun. From then on, his curiosity and thirst for knowledge grew more rapidly than his height. His wonder at the world around him, from fierce New England thunderstorms to the canvas of stars in the night sky, fueled his passion for the sciences.\n"
"Thomas' desire to attend Miskatonic University is almost as old as his love for learning, as its acclaimed College of Sciences and close proximity made it a natural choice. After getting degrees in undergraduate physics and graduate astrophysics at Miskatonic, he began working at the University's Warren Observatory researching astronomical objects and phenomena.\n"
"Born in 1877 in Warsaw, Poland, Mary Zielinski is the youngest child of two teachers. She has fond memories as a little girl helping her mother with cooking and baking, using cups and teaspoons to measure a variety of ingredients, then mixing those ingredients together to create something entirely new. Thereafter, she began experimenting on her own, which propelled her down the path of chemistry and physics.\n"
"Impressed with Mary's credentials, Miskatonic University offered her a full scholarship. Quiet and introverted, she spent much of her time in the laboratories of the Science building doing various experiments. Her hard work and dedication earned her an undergraduate chemistry degree, and she stayed on at the University to achieve a graduate degree in physics.\n"
"Having common interests, Thomas and Mary eventually became acquainted and a relationship followed. Their shared passion for the sciences encouraged and motivated each other, and they collaborated on several projects.\n"
"Years later, one of their most intriguing projects took off: the possibility of a whole new paradigm based on general relativity, which connects the curvature of spacetime to gravity. They began testing the theory that spacetime could be warped, resulting in a discontinuity. Such a warping could result in portals that lead to distant places across the universe, or even to their own location in another era—in effect, time travel.\n"
"This type of groundbreaking work drew the attention of colleagues from campus and beyond. One of these associates was the brilliant and eccentric Edwin Bennet. A rapidly rising star in the field of quantum physics, Edwin became a professor at his alma mater, Miskatonic University. Young and unpublished, he was eager to prove his knowledge would be invaluable to their project, but others on campus expressed substantial concerns, labeling him as \"reckless\" and \"unstable.\"\n"
"After hitting multiple barriers and looking for inspiration, Thomas and Mary welcomed Edwin's offer to collaborate, and the team was confident they were on the verge of a breakthrough—but it never came. It's unclear what exactly transpired next, though some sort of disagreement or conflict resulted in Edwin being replaced by an even more eccentric scientist, Ezra Graves. Thomas and Mary acknowledged and thanked Edwin for his role in their research.\n"
"Ezra's boundless creativity was integral to Thomas and Mary's new approach to their problems, and this fresh perspective allowed them to overcome the barriers. While Ezra soon moved on to his own projects, his contributions were invaluable and greatly appreciated.\n"
"Over the years, Thomas and Mary's research progressed with success after success, culminating in the discovery of teleportation. They published their remarkable findings on February 23, 1955, to much acclaim. And now—or rather, thirty years from now—they are being awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n"
"Though suspect, your intuition tells you this mysterious newspaper is real. In awe of the future notoriety two local scientists will eventually receive, you go to Miskatonic University to meet them. However, you're informed they are not affiliated with the University and, tragically, both of them disappeared years ago.\n"
"Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, a momentous change has occurred. Prominent scientists have vanished without a trace. Notable inventions have become un-invented. A historic discovery has suddenly been undiscovered. Humanity may never be the same.\n"
"You believe you know the truth, even if it's stranger than fiction. You're quite familiar with the notion of portals—you've been through them yourself. For unknown reasons, Arkham, Massachusetts is rife with such portals, but traveling through them is dangerous and not for the faint of heart.\n"
"Within these portals lies the realm of Tindalos, where countless suspended paths, angular and curved, above and below, wind away in all directions. Here and there, they intersect with ramps and spirals. Prowling along these paths are malevolent minions: ghastly satyrs and Hounds of Tindalos, among other monstrosities. The beasts are eager to savage their prey, or, perhaps worse, abduct and imprison them in Tindalos.\n"
"There has been a distortion in time, and its effects have rippled across the ensuing years. These scientists are two such unfortunate souls, and you'll have to find them and repair the broken timeline. Just remember: traveling through time may cause unintended consequences, some of which will have severe repercussions."

"报纸头条：“当地科学家荣获诺贝尔奖！”头条下方，画著两位年长的物理学家自豪地站在一台巨型望远镜前。你瞥了一眼报纸上的日期，你哑然张著嘴。阿卡姆报社出版的时间是1956年12月5日，但这怎么可能呢？\n"
"你既惊讶又好奇，迫切地读了整份报纸，知晓了两位杰出的科学家及他们赢得诺贝尔物理学奖的过程。\n"
"托马斯·科里根是1877年出生于阿卡姆的爱尔兰移民。他最早的记忆是留在户外桌子上的蜡笔，在夏日的高温下融化成一起。从此以后，他的好奇心和求知欲比他的长高的速度还快。他对世界充满好奇心，从猛烈的新英格兰雷暴到如画布般的星空，点燃了他对科学的热情。\n"
"托马斯对于进入米斯卡塔尼克大学的欲望，几乎和以前他对于学习的热忱一样，其备受赞誉的科学学院，位置又接近，可谓天然之选。在拿到米斯卡塔尼克大学的物理学本科学位和天体物理学研究生后，他开始在大学的沃伦天文观测台工作，研究天体与现象。\n"
"1877年出生于波兰华沙，玛丽·杰林斯基也是两名老师中最小的孩子。她从小就有美好的回忆，作为帮助母亲做饭和烘焙的女孩，用杯子和茶匙来测量各种成分，然后将它们混合并创造出全新的东西。此后，她开始自己进行实验，这成为了她走向化学与物理这条路的推力。\n"
"玛丽的证书给米斯卡塔尼克大学留下深刻的印象，以至于校方提供她全额奖学金。安静又内向的她，花了很多时间在科学馆的实验室内进行各种实验。她的努力和刻苦勤奋为她赢得了本科化学学位，并留在大学取得物理学研究生学位。\n"
"有著共同的兴趣，托马斯与玛莉终为相识并随后成为恋人关系。他们在科学上分享热情并鼓励、激励彼此，他们也合作过多个计划。\n"
"多年后，他们最有趣的项目之一开始了：基于广义相对论的全新范式的可能性，将时空的曲率与重力相互联在一起。他们开始测试时空可以扭曲的理论，导致不连续性。这种扭曲可能会导致传送门跨越到宇宙中遥远的地方，甚至到他们自己的位置的另一个时代——也就是，时间旅行。\n"
"这种开创性的工作在校园和其他地方引起了同事们的关注。其中一位同事当属才华洋溢和古怪的艾德温·贝内特。量子物理学领域内一颗冉冉升起的新星，艾德温成为母校米斯卡塔尼克大学的教授。年轻而未经亮相，他渴望证明他的知识对这个项目是无价的，但其他人在校园里表达了极大的担忧，称他为“鲁莽”与“反复无常”。\n"
"在克服重重障碍与寻找灵感之后，托马斯和玛丽对艾德温的合作提议表示接受，团队相信他们即将取得突破——然而这并没有发生。事件之后的发展鲜为人知，尽管有些分歧或冲突导致艾德温被一个更古怪的科学家，爱兹拉·格雷弗丝所取代。托马斯和玛莉承认并感谢艾德温在他们的研究中所发挥的角色。\n"
"爱兹拉无止境的创意对想要解决问题的托马斯和玛丽来说不可或缺，他全新的观点也让他们得以突破重重障碍。等到爱兹拉离开前去进行自己的计划时，他的贡献已经成为无价之宝，并深受两人所感激。\n"
"在这几年中，托马斯和玛丽的研究进展接连成功，最终造就了传送技术的诞生。他们将这场惊人发现于1955年2月23日发表，广受赞誉。而现在——或者说，三十年后的现在——他们被授予了诺贝尔物理学奖。\n"
"虽然可疑，但你的直觉还是告诉你这份神秘的报纸是真的。你怀著对这两名本地科学家在未来注定出名的震惊，前往米斯卡塔尼克大学拜访他们。然而，你被告知们并不属于这座大学，更不幸的是，他们数年前失踪了。\n"
"在世人尚未知道之时，已经发生了一场巨变。杰出科学家就这么不留痕迹地消失了。重要的科学进展退回原点。历史大发现突然变得无处可寻。人类或许已无回到正轨的可能。\n"
"你坚信你知道的是真相，即便它比小说还要离奇。你对次元门的概念很熟悉——毕竟你自己以前就穿越过。出于某种未知原因，马萨诸塞州的阿卡姆到处都是这种次元门，不过穿越它们异常危险，需要过人的勇气。\n"
"次元门的另一边，是被称为廷达洛斯的领域。在那里有无数悬空的道路，既棱角分明、又蜿蜒曲折，或浮于上方、或位于下方——盘根错节向四面八方延伸。它们在各处和坡道以及螺旋状尖塔交缠在一起。潜伏于这些道路上的是凶恶的爪牙们：恐怖的萨蒂尔与廷达洛斯猎犬，还有其他各种各样的怪物。这些野兽热衷于虐杀猎物，或者更惨的是，将他们绑架并囚禁在廷达洛斯。\n"
"时间出现了乱流，它产生的荡漾也影响到了之后的岁月。这两名科学家如此不幸境遇，而你将要找到他们并修复破碎的时间线。切记，时间穿越可能会导致意料之外的后果，甚至会造成无可挽回的恶果。"
