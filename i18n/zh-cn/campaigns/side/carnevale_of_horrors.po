"\"Look,\" Sheriff Engel insists, \"I know it sounds crazy, but that's really all there is to it.\" He sighs and sits back down, pouring a cup of joe for you and one for himself. \"A dame in Uptown spotted a cracked egg wearing this mask and holdin' a bloody butcher's cleaver,\" he says, motioning to the black leather mask sitting on his desk. It has a comically long nose and a strange symbol scrawled in yellow on its forehead. \"So, she calls it in. My boys and I picked him up on the corner of Saltonstall & Garrison.\" The sheriff's jaw clenches and his brows furrow as he recounts the story. \"Fella did nothing but laugh as we slapped the bracelets on him. Called himself Zanni. Said nothing except the 'carnival is coming'; whatever the hell that meant. Wasn't until the next day we found the victim's body. Defense wanted him in a straitjacket. We were happy to oblige.\"\n"
"There isn't much time to spare. If your research is right, there is more to this case than meets the eye. This \"Zanni\" wasn't talking about Darke's Carnival, but rather the Carnevale of Venice, which begins just before the next full moon."

"“听著，”恩格尔警长态度很坚定，“我知道这听起来很疯狂，但事情就是这样的。”他叹了口气，坐回椅子上，给你和他各倒上一杯咖啡。“住宅区有一位夫人看见一个怪人戴著这面具，手里还握著一把淌血的屠刀。”他说著，示意桌面上的黑色皮质面具。这个面具有著滑稽的长鼻子，前额上还潦草地画著一个怪异的黄色符号。 “所以她报了警。我和我的伙计们在索顿斯托尔街和加里森街的交叉口逮住了那家伙。”警长在复述事情经过的时候，咬紧牙关，眉头皱紧。“我们给那个小伙子铐上手铐的时候，他一个劲大笑。他把自己叫做丑角，还一直在说著‘狂欢节要开始了’，天知道他说的是什么意思。直到第二天我们找到了受害者的尸体，才把这和他说的话联系起来。辩方要求他穿上拘束衣。我们也乐于照做。”\n"
"时间所剩不多。如果你的调查无误，这起事件远远没有表面上那么简单。这个“丑角”说的不是达克的狂欢节，而是在下个满月之前举办的威尼斯狂欢节……"

msgid "Choose 1 location at random and remove it from the game. If San Marco Basilica or Canal-side is chosen, randomly choose a different location instead."
msgstr "随机选择1个地点并将其移出游戏。如果所选地点为“圣马可大教堂”或“运河畔”，改为随机选择一个其他地点。"

msgid "Put the other 8 locations into play, in a random circular formation. Each investigator begins play in San Marco Basilica. Put Abbess Allegria Di Biase into play at San Marco Basilica."

msgid "Location Setup"
msgstr "地点设置"

msgid "In this scenario, locations are placed in a circle. Due to the parade during the Carnevale, each location is connected only to the location in the clockwise direction. This means that investigators and monsters can only travel (or count the nearest location) in the clockwise direction unless otherwise noted."
msgstr "在本场冒险中，所有地点排列成圆形。由于狂欢节期间的游行，每个地点只与自己顺时针方向的地点连接。这意味著调查员和怪物只能按顺时针方向移动(或计算最近地点)，除非有特殊说明。"

msgstr "逆时针方向"

msgid "Some cards instruct the players to find the nearest location in the counter-clockwise direction. This is an exception to the above rule and should be followed as though locations are connected counter-clockwise."

msgid "\"Across from\""
msgstr "“对面”"

msgid "The location \"across from\" another location is the farthest location, equidistant in both the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. For the purpose of this scenario, \"across from your location\" and \"across from you\" have the same meaning."
msgstr "如果一个地点在另一个地点的“对面”，那么这两个地点必须相隔最远，不论按顺时针还是逆时针，它们之间的距离都相等。在本场冒险中，“你所在地点‘对面’”和“你‘对面’”的意思相同。"

msgstr "“非常感谢——谢谢你的援助。”在你回到大教堂时，阿莱格说道。“这次没有多少人受伤，都是多亏了你。要是你没来会是一副什么样的境况，我想到就害怕。如果你需要帮助，请尽管开口。”"

msgid "Any one investigator may choose to add Abbess Allegria Di Biase to their deck. This card does not count toward that investigator’s deck size."

msgstr "日蚀期间丧生的人数过多，以致无法阻止奈达斯奎仆从的阴谋。怪物饱腹之后，将力量赋予自己的爪牙。你发现自己盼望生命快些结束，以免见证自己失败造成的恶果。"

msgid "You sputter awake as an oar gently taps your shoulder. \"Tutto bene?\" The gondolier holding the oars says with a concerned expression. You nod and drag yourself onto the docks from his gondola, drenched and aching all over. The city is devastated. Most of the boats in the canal are wrecked. The streets are covered not in confetti, but in blood."
msgstr "一只船桨轻轻地敲了敲你的肩膀，你骤然惊醒。“你还好吗？”贡多拉船夫握著船桨，一脸关切地用义大利语问道。你点点头，从他的贡多拉勉强爬回码头上，浑身湿透，疼痛不已。整座城市都被毁了。运河上的大多数船只都已遭破坏，而街道上遍地覆盖的不是彩纸，而是血液……"

msgid "The city is still recovering from the events during the eclipse. With nearly all evidence of the creature melted away by the hot sun, many attribute the violence during the Carnevale to local crime lord Cascio Di Boerio and his crew. Those that know the truth know better than to speak of the elder creature that lives in Laguna Veneta. With any luck, its name will never be spoken again."
msgstr "这座城市正从日蚀期间的种种事件中逐渐恢复。在灼热的太阳照耀下，有关那头怪物的一切证据几乎都已消失不见，许多人将狂欢节期间发生的凶案归咎于当地犯罪头目卡西奥·迪·博里奥和他的手下。而知晓真相的人知道，最好不要提及威尼斯潟湖里居住著的那只古代生物。如果运气好的话，它的名讳再也不会被人说起。"

msgid "The creature recoils as globules of its jelly-like flesh rip and tear from its body, splashing into the lagoon. It makes no sound as its torn body sinks into the depths. The chanting in the city plunges into mournful silence. As you return to the canal-side streets, black feathers fall from the sky where bright confetti once fluttered. You can only wonder how long it will take for the creature to recover."
msgstr "怪物退缩了，它胶状的肉球从它身体剥落下来，溅入潟湖。它被撕裂的身体无声地沉入深海。城市里的吟唱声嘎然而止，取而代之的是哀伤的沉默。你返回运河旁边的街道时，曾经飘扬著艳丽彩纸的地方飘落许多黑色羽毛。你只想知道那头怪物多久之后会再恢复。"
