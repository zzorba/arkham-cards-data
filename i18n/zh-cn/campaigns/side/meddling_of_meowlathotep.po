msgid "Barkham Horror"
msgstr "狗镇奇谈"

msgid "<i>Barkham Horror</i> is an alternate universe in which the conflict between humanity and the eldritch forces of the mythos takes a back seat, and the conflict between dogs and cats takes center stage."
msgstr "在《狗镇奇谈》的平行宇宙中，人类与神秘力量之间的衝突退居次要位置，而狗与猫之间的矛盾站上了舞台中央。"

msgid "Investigator and player cards included in <i>Barkham Horror</i> expansions cannot be used in traditional <i>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</i> scenarios."
msgstr "《狗镇奇谈》扩展中的调查员卡和玩家卡不能用于传统《诡镇奇谈：卡牌游戏》的冒险。"

msgid "Likewise, only investigators from <i>Barkham Horror</i> expansions should be used while playing a <i>Barkham Horror</i> scenario. Other player cards from any <i>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</i> product may be used."
msgstr "同样地，进行《狗镇奇谈》冒险的游戏时只能使用《狗镇奇谈》扩展裡的调查员。可以使用任意《诡镇奇谈：卡牌游戏》产品中的其他玩家卡。"

msgid "Each time an investigator fails a skill test while attempting to evade an enemy with the alert keyword, after applying all results for that skill test, that enemy performs an attack against the evading investigator. An enemy does not exhaust after performing an alert attack. This attack occurs whether the enemy is engaged with the evading investigator or not."
msgstr "每当调查员在试图躲避一名带有警戒关键词的敌人时技能检定失败，在结算该技能检定带来的所有后果之后，该敌人对进行躲避的调查员执行一次攻击。敌人执行警戒攻击后不被消耗。不论该敌人是否与进行躲避的调查员交战，此类攻击均会发生。"

msgid "“Lousy with cats”"
msgstr "“佈满猫咪”"

msgid "Six of the locations in this scenario begin play with a facedown [[Meowsk]] enemy beneath them. During this scenario, a location with a facedown encounter card beneath it is “lousy with cats.” <b>This has no inherent game effect.</b> However, some card effects may change depending on whether or not a location is lousy with cats."
msgstr "游戏开始时，本场冒险的6个地点底下各有一张正面向下的[[猫怪]]敌人。在本场冒险中，一个地点若底下带有正面朝下的遭遇卡，称这个地点“佈满猫咪”。<b>“佈满猫咪”本身不带有游戏效果。</b>但是，某些游戏效果会根据一个地点是否佈满猫咪而发生改变。"

msgid "If the encounter card beneath a location that is lousy with cats enters play or is removed for any reason, that location is no longer lousy with cats."
msgstr "如果一个佈满猫咪的地点底下的遭遇卡因为任何原因入场或被移除，该地点不再佈满猫咪。"

msgid "“Sniffing” Locations"
msgstr "“嗅”地点"

msgid "Dogs have a fantastic sense of smell. Kate Winthpup in particular has an ability that allows her to “sniff ” a location. You may wish to use a token (such as a resource token) or a piece of scrap paper to record which locations you’ve sniffed. In general, once you sniff a location, it is sniffed for the rest of the game."
msgstr "狗狗都有著出色的嗅觉。凯特·温斯波比有一种特别的能力，能够“嗅”一个地点。你不妨使用一个标记(例如资源标记)或是一张纸片来记录你嗅过的地点。一般来说，一旦你嗅了一个地点，在接下来的游戏当中这个地点就是被嗅过的。"

"It is a dark and stormy night in the storied and haunted city of Barkham. By the time you hit the streets, it is raining cats and dogs. But you’ve picked up the scent of something big, and once you sink your teeth into a story, you just can’t let go. A little wet fur has never stopped you from finding the truth.\n"
"Strange happenings have been going on in Barkham. Cat sightings are at an all-time high, and each day more and more pigeons go missing. While this wouldn’t normally be newsworthy, you know that there is more to this story than meets the eye. After all, while a few cats are harmless and adorable, most are nefarious schemers. You have heard the whispers and the howls on the wind. The Order of Dead Rodents on the Doorstep is back, and whatever they are plotting, only you can stop it.\n"
"You’re heading back to your home in Slobbertown—the Barkham neighborhood closest to the docks—when you catch a whiff of something foul and pungent in the air. Whatever is causing such an acrid stench must be nearby. But just then, another scent—!"

"著名的闹鬼城市汪卡姆这一夜风雨交加，一片漆黑。你来到街上的时候，已经下起了倾盆大雨。但你闻到有大事将要发生，而对于事件，你的獠牙咬上了就不会鬆开。皮毛打湿少许也阻止不了你探寻真相。\n"
"汪卡姆一直有怪事发生。猫比以往都要多，而每天都有更多的鸽子消失。这种消息通常不会见报，但你知道这件事没表面上那麽简单。毕竟可爱又无害的猫咪只佔少数，而大多数都是些邪恶的阴谋家。你曾经听到过低语声，以及风中的呼号声。弑鼠神教重临狗镇，只有你才能阻止它们的阴谋。\n"
"你前往口水区——汪卡姆靠近码头的街区，返回自己的家，这时你闻到空气裡有一股臭味，难闻又刺鼻。附近一定有什麽东西引发了这股恶臭。但就在这时，你闻到了另一股气味——！"

msgid "Follow the foul stench."
msgstr "循著这股难闻的恶臭。"

msgid "Follow the scent of bacon."
msgstr "循著培根的香味。"

msgid "No! You cannot be dissuaded, not even by thoughts of tasty bacon and ear scratches from all of the humans who congegrate around Velma’s Doghouse. This investigation is too important. You continue tracking the awful odor until you come upon its source: a hairball, hacked up in an alleyway by the docks. Of course. If this isn’t proof of feline involvement, you don’t know what is. Then you hear it: HRRK! HRRRRK! There’s only one thing that could be!"
msgstr "不！哪怕是你心裡放不下的美味培根，哪怕是维尔玛犬舍围著的人群挤伤了你的耳朵，也无法叫你停下。这次调查至关重要。你继续追踪，终于找到了这股恶臭的源头：吐在码头旁边一条小巷裡的一团毛球。显而易见。这起事件铁定与猫脱不了干係。随后你听见：呵啊！呵——啊！这就是那种生物的声音！"

msgid "Confront the barfy cat."
msgstr "面对这隻狂吐的猫。"

msgid "Follow the cat to its lair."
msgstr "跟著这隻猫到它的老窝去。"

msgid "The investigation can wait. Bacon is eternal. You follow that lovely smell northeast to Velma’s Doghouse in Beasttown. The sounds of revelry and the sizzling of grilled food make your tail wag faster than the cracking of a whip. And yet, something else tugs at the back of your dog-brain… What was it you were doing before?"
msgstr "调查可以往后捎捎。培根永远是第一位的。你循著这股诱人的香味往东北方向走去，前往野兽区的维尔玛犬舍。狂欢的声音与烧烤食物的滋滋声，让你的尾巴摇得比抽鞭子还快。然而，还有别的什麽东西在揪著你的狗脑子……你本来要干什麽？"

msgid "Nope, food."
msgstr "不管了，管肚子要紧。"

msgid "Oh yeah, investigating the Order."
msgstr "噢对了，调查密会的事。"

"You are too dogged to turn back now. You soon come across the unfortunate creature, the source of the wretched retching. Once it is done, it goes back to licking its fur, and you wonder if cats truly have no sense of cause and effect. “What is the Order plotting?” you ask pointedly.\n"
"“Why should I tell you, mutt?” the cat replies with a hint of apathy in its voice. “You’ll be our prey soon enough.” With that, the cat leaps gracefully from the street to a low-hanging tree branch, and vanishes from sight.\n"
"Prey? You ponder the cat’s words. Conflict between your kind and theirs is as old as time, but you have never been their prey. What exactly is their game…?"
msgstr ""
"你脾性固执，不可能就此放弃。很快你就碰上了那个倒霉鬼，它正在恶心地呕吐著。吐完之后，它又继续舔著自己的毛髮，你怀疑猫压根不懂凡事有因果的道理。“密会有什麽阴谋？”你尖锐地问道。\n"
"“我凭什麽告诉你，笨狗？”猫冷冷回道，“你们马上就是我们的猎物了。”话音刚落，这猫便优雅地跳到一根低垂的树枝上，消失在你的视线裡。\n"
"猎物？你仔细回想那隻猫所说的话。你们两族之间早有衝突，但你们从来不会沦为它们的猎物。它们的计划到底是什麽……？"

"You track the scent of the cat and follow from a distance. Eventually it leaves the docks and makes its way southwest, toward Snoutside. What could a cat be doing way out here?\n"
"Your question is answered when the creature is picked up by a robed human outside the manor house of the Barkham Hisstorical Society, an organization devoted to educating the populace about the “noble” cats of the city. It makes sense that such a reviled cult would be involved in this plot. The human brings the cat indoors, presumably to feed it and give it treats and such. Your blood boils. Curse you, foul cat! How dare you trick these humans into thinking you are cute and fluffy and not at all evil—!"

"你追踪那隻猫的气味，远远地跟著它。最后它离开了码头，往西南方向走去，前往鼻子区。猫怎麽会到这儿来？\n"
"你的问题很快就得到了答案，这隻猫在汪卡姆历史协会大楼外被一名戴著兜帽的男子接走，而历史协会致力于告诉平民，这座城市裡的猫咪有多麽“高贵”。这次阴谋中有此等臭名昭著的邪教组织掺和，一切都说得通了。这隻猫被人领进门去，大概是要喂它吃些食物什麽的。你热血沸腾。该死的臭猫！你怎麽敢欺骗这些人类，让他们以为你很可爱，毛茸茸的，一点也不邪恶——！"

": It isn’t until your belly is full of yummy food and your tummy has been thoroughly rubbed that you remember why you were out and about in the first place. You patrol the area until you spot several panicked rats scurrying from a nearby sewer drain.\n"
"“What’s the matter?” you bark. They chitter and chirp in response, and it is only then that you remember that rats can’t talk. Still, you glean some of their story from their frantic pantomiming. The Order of Dead Rodents at the Doorstep, as evidenced by their very namesake, has been hunting rats for ages. But now it is not just cats hunting them, but horrid cat-abominations that defy all earthly logic. Sounds like the Order is up to its old tricks once again…"

"你在肚子裡塞满了美食，将鼓鼓的肚皮揉了个遍之后，才想起来你一开始为什麽跑出来。你在这个区域巡逻，发现几隻惊慌失措的老鼠从附近的一条下水道裡窜出来。\n"
"“怎麽了？”你吠叫道。它们发出吱吱喳喳的声音作为回应，这时你才想起来老鼠不会说话。儘管如此，你还是能从它们疯狂比划的手势中得到一些信息。弑鼠神教正如其教名，多年以来都在猎杀老鼠。但现在猎杀它们的不单单是猫，还有违反现世逻辑的恐怖猫怪，看来弑鼠神教要故技重施了……"

"The urgency of your investigation is too important for you to be distracted by thoughts of tasty food. As you turn away from Velma’s, you spot a streak of cat-fur dipping gracefully out of sight. Using your keen sense of smell, you keep a tight pursuit as the cat winds its way west to Tailside, where Barkham’s train station can be found.\n"
"You follow the cat to the tracks on the western edge of town, where it ducks underneath an abandoned train car marked with a cat’s paw print. “Meowsachusetts Catnip Co.” reads the label beneath the logo. A front for a cult headquarters, no doubt. You are about to eavesdrop on the cats’ refuge when suddenly, a creature bursts forth from underneath the train! It is a hideous hybrid of bird, bat, and cat, with webbed paws and membranous wings notably lacking in fur, though its face is unmistakably feline. The sight of the thing makes your fur stand on end."

"你的当务之急就是要进行调查，美味的食物也无法令你分神。你从维尔玛犬舍走开的时候，你发现猫毛形成的一抹曲线优雅地离开了你的视野。那隻猫蜿蜒向西，前往汪卡姆火车站所在的尾巴区，而你凭藉著敏锐的嗅觉紧紧跟随。\n"
"你跟著猫来到城西边缘的铁轨，它就躲在一节印有猫爪印的废旧车厢下面。猫爪印下面的标籤写著“喵萨诸塞州猫薄荷公司”。无疑裡面就是邪教总部了。你正要偷听这处猫咪庇护所裡面的声音，突然一个生物从火车下面冲了出来！那是一种鸟、蝙蝠与猫的混血生物，形貌恐怖，带蹼的爪子，膜状的翅膀，身上明显没有毛髮，但又无疑长了一张猫脸。一见那傢伙你就吓得毛髮倒竖。"
