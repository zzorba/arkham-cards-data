msgid "Your cell has been given the name of a contact at Défis de la Roulette: Isamara Ordoñez. Isamara is not just an employee there, she is the \"Flor de Nicaragua,\" a singer whose performances have become a major draw for the casino. She has reputedly reached out to various parties for help over the course of the past month, concerned with some of the events she has witnessed behind the scenes. The Foundation has reason to believe a Key may be involved in these strange events. You find a table in the casino lounge, and wait for an opportune moment to attract her attention. Only a few minutes later, a woman in a striking red dress takes the stage. Her performance is so captivating that she is already leaving the stage before you remember why you are here. There is no doubt that she is the one you are looking for. As she glances at the crowd, you give a small wave. At first, she appears to take little notice, but then her eyes fall to the flower that you were told to wear. She approaches your table and sits down. A casual smile adorns her face, but her words are sharp and pointed. \"If you were sent by Them, its not safe to talk here. Meet me in an hour.\" She hands you a card with the address of a nearby café. She then stands, smoothing out her dress. \"Thank you so much for the kind words about my performance!\" she says for the benefit of anyone nearby. Hope to see you again soon!\""
msgstr "你取得了一个名字：伊萨玛拉·奥多涅斯，她是你在轮盘挑战中的联络人。伊萨玛拉不是普通员工，她是被称为“尼加拉瓜之花”的歌手，她的表演是赌场的主要卖点。据说她在过去几个月秘密帮助了几个想调查这些奇异事件的组织，她对于自己在幕后目击到的一些事件非常担忧。根据目前掌握的情报，基石相信这些超自然事件背后有密钥的力量作祟。你在赌场交谊厅的一张空桌坐下，等待引起她注意的时机。几分钟后，一名女子身穿一袭令人惊艳的红色礼服走上舞台，她的表演摄人心魄，一直到她走下舞台，你才重新想起自己前来的原因。毫无疑问，她就是你要找的人。当她扫视人群时，你向她低调的挥手。一开始她似乎并没有注意，但接著她看见了你配戴的花，这是你们约定好的暗号。她走到你的桌子旁坐下，脸上挂著轻松的微笑，但话语却紧绷而尖锐：“这里不安全，一个小时后跟我碰面。”她将一张卡片塞进你手中，上面写著附近一间咖啡厅的地址。她随即起身，抚平礼服上的皱褶。“谢谢各位的赞美！”她向所有观众说，“希望很快能再相见！”"
