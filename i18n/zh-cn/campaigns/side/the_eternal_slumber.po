"Some abilities in <i>Guardians of the Abyss</i> are identified with an <b>Explore</b> action designator. Such abilities are generally used to find new locations to put into play, and are initiated using the “activate” action.\n"
"<b>Explore</b> abilities instruct you to draw the top card of the “exploration deck,” which is a separate deck that will be constructed during this scenario. This deck consists of several single-sided locations and treachery cards."
msgstr ""
"<i>深渊守卫</i>中的某些能力带有<b>探索</b>行动标识。此类能力通常会通过“启动”行动发动，用于找出新的地点并将这一地点放置入场。\n"
"<b>探索</b>能力会指示你抽取“探索牌堆”顶上的1张卡牌。探索牌堆是一个独立的牌堆，在某些冒险的设置阶段构成该牌堆，包含多张单面地点卡和诡计卡。"

msgid "Each <b>Explore</b> ability indicates a particular type of location that you are seeking to draw. <b>If a location of that type is drawn, it is put into play, and you move to that location.</b> This is considered a “successful” exploration."
msgstr "每个<b>探索</b>能力会声明你正在寻找并要抽出的一类地点。<b>抽出一个该类地点后，将其放置入场，然后你移动到该地点。</b>这视为一次“成功”的探索。"

msgid "If any other location is drawn, place it next to the exploration deck, and draw the next card from the exploration deck. Repeat this process until a location of the indicated type is drawn, or a treachery is drawn. After this action has ended, shuffle each location next to the exploration deck back into the exploration deck."
msgstr "如果抽出了其他任何地点，将其放在探索牌堆旁边，然后抽取探索牌堆的下一张卡牌。重复此流程，直到抽出指定类型的地点，或抽出诡计卡。在此行动结束后，将探索牌堆旁的所有地点混洗并放回探索牌堆。"

msgid "If a treachery card is drawn, it is resolved as normal. If it is discarded, place it in the encounter discard pile as you would normally. There is no discard pile for the exploration deck. This is considered an “unsuccessful” exploration."

It is neither successful nor unsuccessful. All locations drawn during the exploration should be shuffled back into the exploration deck, and the investigator’s action ends."
msgstr "如果探索牌堆抽完时没有抽到诡计卡或是探索能力声明的一类地点，探索结束。这种情况不视为成功或失败的探索。将探索牌堆旁的所有地点混洗并放回探索牌堆，然后调查员的行动结束。"

msgid "<i>Example: Act 1a—“Search for the Gate” has the following ability: “[action]: <b>Explore</b>. Draw the top card of the exploration deck. If it is a connecting location, put it into play and move to it.” Ursula Downs is at the Expedition Camp and wishes to find a new location to travel to. She spends her first action to explore, drawing the top card of the exploration deck. The card she draws is Desert Oasis. Because Desert Oasis is a location that is not connected to the Expedition Camp, it is placed next to the exploration deck, and Ursula draws the next card in the exploration deck. This time, she draws the Sandstorm treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Desert Oasis that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action. This time, she draws Nile River, which is connected to the Expedition Camp. Her exploration is successful. Nile River is put into play with clues on it equal to its clue value, and Ursula immediately moves from the Expedition Camp to the Nile River.</i>"

"Story cards are a new cardtype in this scenario. These cards serve as an avenue for additional narrative and typically appear as the reverse side of another scenario card. When you are instructed to resolve a story card, simply read its story text and resolve its game text, if any.\n"

msgid "Strength of the Abyss"
msgstr "深渊之力"

msgid "During this scenario, resources on the scenario reference card represent the current strength of the abyss. When you are instructed to add strength to the abyss or remove strength from the abyss, adjust the number of resource tokens on the scenario reference card accordingly. The strength of the abyss has no inherent game effect on its own, though certain encounter card effects may grow stronger or change depending on the current strength of the abyss. Beware—as the abyss grows in strength, so too will the forces set against you. Should it grow too powerful, you will surely fail as Guardians of the Abyss."
msgstr "在本场冒险中，冒险辅助卡上的资源数量表示当前深渊之力的强度。当你受到指示，要增强或减弱深渊之力时，相应地调整冒险辅助卡上的资源标记数目。深渊之力本身没有效果；但是，某些遭遇卡的效果根据当前的深渊之力，可能会改变或变得更强。要当心——深渊之力越是强大，你要面临的阻力也会越大。要是它变得过于强大，你就会败在深渊守卫的手上。"

msgstr "“坠入深渊”"

msgid "If an effect states that a defeated investigator or [[Ally]] asset has been <i>“taken by the abyss,”</i> that character has been afflicted by a curse which puts them in a comatose state. When an investigator or [[Ally]] asset is <i>taken by the abyss</i>, first add 1 strength to the abyss. Then, if that card was unique, record in the campaign log that <i>“(card name) was taken by the abyss.”</i> An investigator who has been <i>taken by the abyss</i> is treated as if he or she was killed or driven <b>insane</b>. Additionally, for the remainder of the campaign, players cannot play copies of any unique [[Ally]] asset who has been <i>taken by the abyss.</i>"

"<fancy>I'm sorry. I know it has been some time since my last correspondence. I am writing to you now because there is nobody I can trust here in Cairo. I don't even know if this letter will make it to you safely. I can only hope it does, for all our sakes.</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>There's something wrong in this city. It started a few weeks ago. The head curator of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities fell asleep and simply never awoke. I thought nothing of it at first; just a medical curiosity, a mystery the doctors would solve in due time. But then it happened again. And again. More and more, people all across the city started falling into comas. Now it's happening every night. . . And as I write to you, they are taking my husband John to the hospital.</fancy>\n"
