"Red tape is stifling. Ever since you arrived in Arkham, your cases have gotten harder and harder to navigate. You thought you would be tracking down smugglers and mobsters, not imaginary monsters. But the longer your absurd cases remain open, the more you begin to think maybe they aren’t so absurd, after all. And perhaps that means the monsters aren’t imaginary, either.\n"
"The Bureau has countless guidelines for handling cases of all sorts, but it is eerily silent on the matter of human sacrifices. So when you were told about the bodies found inside the Black Cave, you weren’t sure where to begin. Questioning the locals and loved ones of the deceased yielded nothing of value. The evidence left behind in the cave was unhelpful, to say the least—offerings and writings proclaiming the sacrifices to be gifts, along with depictions of a monstrous tree. So you did what you do best: you put your nose to the ground and found the thread connecting all of the deaths.\n"
"One man lies at the center of all of the victims: Mr. Damien Grey. The congressman is not from Arkham, has no relatives or loved ones in the area, and is on no committee that would require his presence in town. And yet, he’s been staying in Arkham for the past few months, his purpose unknown. And he is connected to each of the victims through no more than two degrees of separation, which smells fishy to you. Fishier still is the police escort that follows Mr. Grey through town 24/7, despite the fact that there have been no threats on the congressman’s well-being.\n"
"You have to get to the bottom of this mystery, and soon. Now you see that damned tree everywhere. More people go missing by the day, and some have even claimed to see goatlike monsters prowling the alleyways. But if Mr. Grey is indeed behind this, you’ll have to be careful. Falsely accusing a politician would certainly spell the end of your career. Time to do what you came to do: dig up the proof, discover the truth, and bring the culprits in for questioning. Every “i” dotted, every “t” crossed."

"繁文缛节简直令人窒息。自从你来到阿卡姆后，你的案件变得越来越难处理。你以为你会对付走私者和暴徒，而不是虚构的怪物。但是，随著这些荒谬案件悬而未决的时间拖得越长，你渐渐开始觉得这些案件没这么荒谬了。也许这意味著怪物不是凭空想像出来的。\n"
"当局有无数的指导方针，能够处理各种案件，但是出奇地缺了献祭人类的方面。所以，当你被通知在黑暗洞窟里发现了尸体时，你不太确定该怎么开始。询问当地人和死者的亲人没有什么结果。洞穴中留下的证据也没甚么价值——供品和文字宣称说这场献祭是赠礼，还描绘了一棵怪物般的树。所以你只能尽你所擅长的事情：嗅出线索，寻找连接所有死亡事件的共通点。\n"
"所有受害者的交集是一名男子：国会议员戴米恩·格雷先生。他不是阿卡姆本地人，在本地没有亲戚或家人，镇上也没有需要他出席的会议。然而，过去几个月他一直待在阿卡姆，目的不明。而且他与每个受害者相连的分隔度都不超过两度，这对你来说相当蹊跷。尽管国会议员没有受到任何威胁，但仍然有位警察——费希尔——全天候贴身护送格雷先生在镇上的行动。\n"
"你得尽快解开这个谜团的真相。现在你到处都看到那棵该死的树。每天都有更多的人失踪，甚至有人声称看到了像山羊一样的怪物在小巷里徘徊。但如果格雷先生真的是这件事的幕后黑手，你就得十分小心。要是错误地指控一个政客，你的职业生涯肯定就完了。该是时候尽你的职责了：挖掘证据、找出真相，把罪魁祸首带回来审问。每个细节都必须一丝不苟。"
