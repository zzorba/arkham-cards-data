"There have been reports of strange occurrences at Arkham’s Excelsior Hotel for over a month now. Disappearances. Bizarre sightings. Sudden closures, sometimes for days at a time, seemingly without warning. It’s like something out of a ghost story, but you know better than to simply dismiss these rumors. Too many people have whispered about the Excelsior…and to make matters worse, it seems the stories have only grown more unsettling in the last week. It’s time somebody looked into it all.\n"
"You’ve tried going to the police, but the grizzled and world‑weary Sergeant Monroe has dismissed you every time. You’ve been left to investigate on your own. Asking around at all the local hot-spots yields no leads. Velma’s Diner, Hibb’s Roadhouse, La Bella Luna; Each visit leaves you with only more questions. That is, until today.\n"
"While walking down Central Avenue in Downtown, minding your own business, you bump into a man in a long trench coat. You begin to apologize, but he simply continues walking briskly away from you. It isn’t until you return home that you find the note in your pocket—one that wasn’t there before.\n"

"一个多月以来，一直有报导称阿卡姆的艾肖希尔酒店发生了奇怪的事件。失踪事件、离奇的目击事件、突然的停业，有时持续好几天，似乎没有任何预兆。这像是鬼故事里才听得到的东西，但你知道不能轻视这些谣言。太多人私下讨论艾肖希尔酒店了……更糟的是，这些故事在上周变得更加令人不安。该有人彻查一下这一切了。\n"
"你曾试著报警，但头发花白又厌世的门罗警司每次都将你打发走。你只能独自进行调查。在当地所有的热点地区打听也没有得到线索。维尔玛小餐馆、希伯酒馆、月下美人；每处的拜访都只给你留下了更多疑问，直到今天。\n"
"当你走在商业区的中央大道上，想著自己的事情时，你撞上了一名身穿长风衣的男子。你开口道歉，但他只是自顾自地走了。直到你到家，才发现那张之前不在口袋里的纸条。\n"

"The Excelsior is busy tonight. Either the rumors haven’t fazed these guests, or the stories have given the hotel a new allure. Everything seems normal.

A uniformed security guard reads the latest Arkham Advertiser in the corner.\n"
"And yet, you can’t get the note’s final warning out of your mind.\n"
"You stride quickly across the lobby and up the stairs, wondering if you should have let someone know where you were going. Was it wise to come alone? What if you’re walking into a trap? You set your jaw and clench your fists as you stand in front of the blood-red door to room 225, and before you can second guess yourself any further, you knock. There’s no going back now."

The entire time, you find yourself glancing to the coffee table in front of you, and the curved dagger that rests there. He pauses for a moment, pours himself a drink, and raises the glass to his lips with a shaky grip. He then pours a second drink and hands it to you. “This is all going to sound crazy,” he says, his voice little more than a whisper. He glances at every darting shadow and twitches at every creak the old building makes. “I’m beginning to feel crazy, but there’s too much going on here to just ignore. And I’ve been a part of it long enough…” You listen closely, but his words are starting to run together. His voice is ethereal and wispy, like wind at the end of a long tunnel. You blink rapidly. Your vision blurs. The next thing you know, you’re on your feet. Your glass drops to the floor, and then—"

The entire building shakes to its foundations, and you hear guests screaming. “What in the hell?” He looks to the door, then to you. “Stay put,” he warns, “Or I swear, next time I see you, you’re gettin’ cuffed.” He runs off to investigate the noise, mumbling about how he is getting too old for this job."

Drugged, maybe. Crazy as it sounds, the pieces fit. I think you’re telling the truth. But if there's someone else pulling the strings, we've gotta figure out who, or nobody's gonna believe either one of us.” A drop of sweat slides down his forehead. “Come on, let’s go.”"
msgstr "门罗警司半信半疑地听著你的故事，但随著你向他提供越来越多的证据，他对你也逐渐改观。“好吧。”你一解释完他就说道。“所以你是被迫的，可能是被下了药。虽然听起来很疯狂，但细节都对得上。我觉得你说的是实话，但如果还有人在幕后操纵，我们得找出是谁，不然没有人会相信我们的。”一滴汗珠从他额头滑落，“来，走吧。”"

Driven berserk, the specter will not stop until it has killed every last person in the hotel."

"Nobody will ever believe what you witnessed at the Excelsior. Not three days later, the hotel was open again, like nothing had ever happened. You know better, though. You witnessed it all firsthand. The events continue to haunt your dreams and your waking thoughts. Even now you go out of your way to avoid the Excelsior, though weeks have passed and there has been no sign of any other nefarious schemes within its accursed walls. The only thing that can quiet the echoing memories of that horrible experience is a visit to the local speakeasy. But all the booze in the world can’t keep the grisly visions from your nightmares, waking you in the dead of night with a violent start, soaked in sweat. That’s when you notice the person asking around town about the Excelsior. Innocent questions, at first, but more prodding with each passing day. Surely they will believe you. Somebody has to. You may have broken free of the Excelsior’s grasp, but there will be other victims, of that you are sure. You grab a piece of paper and hastily scribble a note.\n"

"“Sit there any longer and I’ll have to charge you rent.” You blink rapidly, as if coming out of a deep dream. Looking up, you see a waiter giving you an annoyed look. He is carrying a stack of dirty dishes. In your hand is a glass of water. You don’t remember ordering it, nor do you remember how long you’ve been here. And where <i>is</i> here, exactly? You spin around in your chair and realize you’re in the restaurant of the Excelsior Hotel. A few other diners are present, catching an early dinner and minding their own business. The soft light of an autumn afternoon filters in through the windows, and the general din of activity can be heard from the lobby. You turn and briefly glance back at the waiter before reaching in your pocket and dropping a quarter on the table, heading for the lobby. Your legs feel like jelly. As you stumble out of the restaurant, other guests view you with concern. The security guard in the corner watches you like a hawk. You head over to the front desk, steadying yourself against it. The concierge approaches, but you recoil at the recognition of his face. The hotel is operating as if nothing happened. But that can’t be. Everything you saw was true, right? You dash out the front door before he can reach you. You have to put some distance between yourself and this accursed place.\n"
"Weeks pass. Nothing helps to quell the feeling in your mind that you have missed something important. This business with the Excelsior is not done, not by a long shot. You begin your investigation anew, asking around town for the latest rumors regarding the hotel. More missing staff. More sudden closures. Guests who never arrived. Guests who <i>never</i> left. It’s all too much.\n"
"Standing on a lonely street corner in Northside, you consider your options. Streetlamps flicker to life around you as evening creeps in. Just then, a stranger bumps into you, muttering a half-hearted apology. You take a step after them before you feel something tugging at the back of your mind. No. Could it be? You stick your hands into your coat pocket. Stuffed inside is a small, folded note. You look up, but the pedestrian is nowhere in sight. You unfold the note slowly, fingers shaking from anxiety and fear.\n"

"“你再坐下去，我就要跟你收租金了！”你快速眨眼，像是从深沉的梦境中醒来。你抬起头来，看到服务生一脸不悦。他手上拿著一叠脏盘子。你手里拿著一杯水，你不记得你点了它，你也不记得你在这里待了多久。而且这里又是哪里？你在椅子上转了一圈，发现自己正身处艾肖希尔酒店的餐厅中。其他一些用餐的客人也在，他们吃著提前的晚餐，对周遭漠不关心。秋日午后柔和的阳光通过窗户洒了进来，大厅中传来日常营业的喧闹。你转身瞥了服务生一眼，然后把手伸进口袋，将一枚25美分的硬币放在桌上，便走向大厅。你感觉你的双脚发软。你跌跌撞撞地走出餐厅时，其他顾客都关注著你。角落的保安像老鹰一样盯著你看。你走向前台，靠著前台稳住身子。服务员靠近了你，但你认出他的脸而畏缩了。酒店就像什么也没发生过一样照常营业，但这不可能。你看到的一切都是真的，是吧？他还没来得及碰到你，你就冲出了前门，你得和这个该死的地方保持距离。\n"
"几周过去了，你觉得你漏掉了什么重要的事情，没有什么能抚平这种感觉。艾肖希尔酒店的事情还没结束，完全没有。你重新开始调查，在镇上四处打听关于酒店的最新传闻。越来越多的失踪员工、越来越多的突然停业、从未到达的客人、从未离开的客人。太多太多了。\n"
"你站在北区一个孤僻的街角，思索著你接下来的打算。夜幕降临，周围的街灯亮了起来。就在这时，一个陌生人撞上了你，他含糊不清地道了歉。你跟上前迈了一步，脑海中突然有些思绪在拉扯。不。不会吧？你将手伸进外套口袋。里面塞著一张折叠的小字条。你抬头张望，但那陌生人早已不见踪影。你慢慢展开字条，手指因焦虑和恐惧而颤抖。\n"
