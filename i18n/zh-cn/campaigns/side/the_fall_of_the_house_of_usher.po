"Dr. Armitage breathes a sigh through his nose as he thumbs through an occult tome, shaking his head. “I can’t find a shred of evidence, but I know something is dreadfully wrong. For years I have been acquainted with the Usher family — one of the earliest families to have emigrated from England, perhaps. Roderick and his sister Madeline are the last descendants of the Ushers. I haven't heard or talked to them in the better ‘part of two decades, but now, out of the blue, Roderick sends me a letter pleading for my personal help.\n"
"Their manor — the house of Usher, as it is called — is a morose place to be sure, but there has always been something unnatural about it, something that the Ushers have hidden for centuries. cannot find a single hint as to what that secret might be, but I'd stake my reputation on ere being something evil in that house. Evil enough that after ten generations, Roderick feels that he must act, or ask others to act if he cannot.\n"
"However, I am not as fit as I once was, nor is this my area of expertise. Can I rely on you to expose this evil?”"

msgid "You flee across the causeway, not stopping in your escape from the house until a red light reaches your peripheral vision. You turn to see the rays of the red setting sun shining through the great fissure in the manor. Walls and roofs collapse inward, and brick by brick, the house of Usher shakes apart, each piece dropping into the roiling waters of the dark tarn. You watch, transfixed by the sight, until at last the sounds of destruction cease and the waters of the tarn go still once more. The evil that dwells in those dark waters li dormant once more, but for how long?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You trudge slowly out the cracked door of the manor and look up at the broken ruin. What little remains of the house stands like skeleton above the still waters of the tarn. There is nothing left here for you - or anyone else, you can only hope. The Usher family is no more, and you pray that no one ever returns to awaken the thing in the tarn. You can take little back to Arkham with you but Madeline's locket as proof of your deed, though you swear you can still feel her silent spirit following you as you depart the grounds."
