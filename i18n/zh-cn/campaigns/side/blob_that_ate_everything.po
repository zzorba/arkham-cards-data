"<i>0312 hours - Impact event just outside of Blackwater. Intercepted police call, agents sent to investigate. Interviewed local farmer, Ron Graham; claims meteor was several feet wide, greenish hue. Crater roughly 100 yards in diameter. Radiation detected in outlying area. Recommend immediate quarantine and further observation by research team. Situation under control.</i>"

"<i>事件报告：8L-08</i>\n"
"<i>1928年7月5日，星期四</i>\n"
"<i>马萨诸塞州黑水镇</i>\n"
"\n"
"<i>上午3时12分——黑水镇外发生陨石撞击事件。警方接到来电，并派出探员前往调查。当地农夫朗·格雷厄姆接受询问时，声称那是一块绿色的陨石，足有数英尺宽。陨石坑的直径为100码(91.44米)，在其外围区域探测到辐射。建议立即隔离，并且交由研究团队进一步观察。局势已得到控制。</i>"

msgid ""
"It wasn't under control.\n"
"That was the report the G-men took when they first arrived. For the next few days, the town of Blackwater was on lockdown. The impact was all that was talked about in the papers, but not much was known aside from the enormous crater and the effect it had on the countryside. Nobody was allowed to leave the town, and only those approved by the shadow government agency was allowed to enter. Those unfortunate few included high-ranking government agent, and a team of researchers from the nearby Miskatonic University, who were summoned to investigate the meteor itself. For the rest of the town's inhabitants, it was a strange occurence, nothing more… that is, until the meteor <i>hatched</i>.\n"
"I saw it with my own eyes. When the anomaly emerged, the first thing it did was devour the team of researchers who have been sent to collect and study samples from the meteor. The next thing it did was devour their lab equipment. Then Ron Graham's tractor. Then his house, in its entirety. It continued to grow and spread, devouring everything in its path. I barely escaped with my life.\n"
"When the army arrived, they thought they could kill it with bullets and shells. Everything they threw at the creature was devoured, one round after the next. Then it split into hundreds of smaller pieces of itself, and the army was quickly overwhelmed. While the battle raged on, myself and others back in town saw lights and shapes in the sky above. Something was up there, waiting. Biding time.\n"
"The quarantine still holds, and we're stuck in the middle of it. It won't be long before the anomaly has grown large enough to devour everything in Blackwater. And if that happens, who could possibly stop its rampage?"
msgstr ""
"局势并没有得到控制。\n"
"这份报告是最先到达此地的联邦调查员写下的。在接下来的几天里，黑水镇处于封锁状态。众多报纸都登载了陨石撞击一事，但除了巨大的陨石坑和它对村庄造成的影响之外，人们对这件事知道的并不多。任何人都不允许离开这座小镇，进镇也必须得到政府秘密机构的批准。有少数人不幸地得到了这一批准，其中包含高级政府特工，为了调查陨石，还找来了附近的米斯卡塔尼克大学的一队研究员。对这座小镇其余的住民来说，这不过是件怪事，别无其他……直到那块陨石“孵化”。\n"
"我亲眼目睹了那一幕。怪物现身时，它先是吞噬了派去收集和研究陨石様本的整队研究员，紧接著是他们的实验仪器。再是朗·格雷厄姆的拖拉机，然后将他的房子整个吞入。它继续生长、扩大，将沿路遇到的一切都吃干抹净。我差点没能活著逃出来。\n"
"军队赶到时，他们还以为能用枪子儿和炮弹把这玩意给干掉。他们一波又一波地发起攻势，但不论他们用了什么武器，都会成为那头怪物的食粮。然后它自己分裂成数百个碎片，转瞬间湮没了整支军队。战争打得激烈，此时我和返回小镇的其他人一同望向上空，看见无数光芒与形状在变换。天上有什么东西等待著，等待著时机到来。\n"
"小镇仍被隔离，我们被困在镇上了。那头怪物越长越大，要不了多久，整座黑水镇都会被它吞噬。到那个时候，谁还能阻止它肆虐呢？"
