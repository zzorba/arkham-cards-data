"Minnie Klein, your contact at the Arkham Advertiser, had slipped you a draft of the article over a cup of coffee at Velma's Diner. It would have gone to print had Doyle Jeffries, the lead editor, not scoffed at the concept. \"I believe his exact words were, 'I ain't printing it off as news,'\" she explained. From the sly grin spreading across her face, you could tell she smelled a story.\n"
"The headline was sensaltionalist. Three killings in nine days was enough to spook a town, sure. But you doubt all of New Orleans is gripped by terror, or even knows about the killings. Still, something piqued your interest. \"Lady Esprit,\" the Voodoo priestess from the article, claimed that a malign curse had taken root in the bayou.\n"
"\"There's something to this, isn't there? I know that look,\" Minnie said. You weren't sure. If Lady Esprit was right, this \"roux-ga-roux\" wouldn't stop killing at three, that's for sure. But curses? Wolf-people? How could such things be real? Only one way to find out. You put on your coat and head for the Northside Station."

"在维尔玛小餐馆，你和你阿卡姆报社的联络人明妮·克莱因见面，她从桌子对面递给你一篇文章手稿。要不是因为主编道尔·杰弗里斯的嘲弄，它早就该登报了。“我记得他的原话是：‘我是不会把某个巫毒教疯子的胡话印出来当作新闻的。’”她解释道。从她脸上狡诘的微笑，你知道她嗅到了新闻的气味。\n"
"头条骇人听闻。在九天里发生了三起杀人事件，这无疑会震惊全城。但你并不觉得这件事会吓坏整个新奥尔良，你怀疑甚至有些人都不知道这些杀人事件。然而，一个人名勾起了你的兴趣。报纸上称“埃斯普利女士”是巫毒教女祭司，她声称有一道邪恶诅咒已在河口扎根。\n"
"“她说的有点道里，不是吗？至少看起来是这样。”明妮说道。你并不敢肯定。如果埃斯普利女士所言非虚，你敢断言，所谓“狼人诅咒”不会只取三人性命。但诅咒是什么？狼人？这种事怎么可能是真的？只有一种办法能够找出真相。你披上外衣，前往北区火车站……"

msgid "Set the Curse of the Rougarou encounter set aside, out of play."
msgstr "将<i>狼人诅咒</i>遭遇组放在一边，位于场外。"

msgid "Sort each of the locations into 4 piles, by trait ([[New Orleans]], [[Riverside]], [[Wilderness]], and [[Unhallowed]]). Randomly choose 1 of these piles and remove those locations from the game. Randomly choose another 1 of these piles and put those locations into play. Set each location in the other 2 piles aside, out of play. Each investigator begins play at a [[Bayou]] location in play."
msgstr "将所有地点根据属性([[新奥尔良]]、[[河畔]]、[[荒地]]、[[不洁]])分作四堆。随机选择其中一堆，并将该堆地点移出游戏。随机选择其中另一堆，并将该堆地点放置入场。将其余2堆地点的所有地点卡牌放在一边，位于场外。每位调查员从场上一个[[河口]]地点开始游戏。"

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Lady Esprit, Bear Trap, and Fishing Net."
msgstr "将下列卡牌放在一边，位于场外：“埃斯普利女士”、“捕熊陷阱”、“渔网”。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>the Rougarou is destroyed, and the curse is lifted</i>. Remove the Curse of the Rougarou weakness from it's bearers deck. Any one investigator may choose to add Lady Esprit to their deck. This card does not count toward that investigator’s deck size."
msgstr "在冒险日志中，记录下“<i>狼人被摧毁且诅咒被移除</i>”。将“狼人诅咒”弱点从承受者的牌堆移除。任意一位调查员可以选择将“埃斯普利女士”加入其牌组。这张卡牌不计入该调查员的牌组张数。"

msgid "the Rougarou is destroyed, and the curse is lifted."
msgstr "狼人被摧毁且诅咒被移除。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>the Rougarou escaped, and you embraced the curse</i>. The bearer of the Curse of the Rougarou weakness must add Monstrous Transformation to their deck. This card does not count toward that investigator’s deck size."
msgstr "在冒险日志中，记录下“<i>狼人逃离且你身负诅咒</i>”。“狼人诅咒”的弱点承受者必须将“兽性变化”加入自己的牌组。这张卡牌不计入该调查员的牌组张数。"

msgid "the Rougarou escaped, and you embraced the curse."
msgstr "狼人逃离且你身负诅咒。"

msgid "the Rougarou continues to haunt the bayou."
msgstr "狼人继续在河口出没。"

msgid "Somehow, you manage to make it back to safety before daybreak, resting until late in the afternoon. It isn't until you seek out Lady Esprit the next day that you realize who last night's victim was. With a heavy heart and an unshakable dread, you choose to bury her body instead of contacting the authorities—the less people who delve this deep into the bayou, the better."
msgstr "然而，你成功在天亮之前回到了安全的地方，一直休息到下午。直到你第二天去找埃斯普利女士，你才意识到昨晚的受害者是谁。怀著沉重的心情和挥之不去的恐惧，你没有联系当局，而是自己埋葬了她的尸体——越少人踏入河口深处越好。"

msgid "The creature givs a pitiful wail as dark miry blood oozes from its wounds. By the time its body collapses into the mud, it has transformed back into its original form—the form of a young dark-skinned man, his expression twisted in agony. You bring his body back to Lady Esprit and she works her strange magic, removing the stain of the curse from the land. \"Call on me should you ever need my help,\" the mysterious woman tells you."
msgstr "当黑色的污血从那只生物的伤口渗出，它发出一声可怜的哀嚎。它的身体倒在淤泥的时候，它变回了原来的型态——这是个年轻的黑人，表情因痛苦而扭曲。你将他的尸体带回到埃斯普利女士那儿去，她运用自己神奇的魔力，从这片土地上清除诅咒的污痕。“如果你需要我的帮助，就来找我。”这位神秘女子对你说道。"

msgid "Somehow you have managed to quell the rage and bloodlust of the curse within the creature, and in moments the shape of a young, dark-skinned man stands before you, panting and sweating. He seems to only just now understand everything he's done, and agrees to flee to a secluded corner of the earth where he can harm no one. However, the curse lives on. He sees it in your eyes and grips your arm tightly. \"Don't let it take control,\" he warns. \"I was weak, but you—I can tell you are strong. Control the curse as I could not.\""
msgstr "不知怎么，你成功地平息了诅咒给这只生物带来的愤怒和嗜血欲望，片刻后你面前出现了一个年轻的黑人，气喘吁吁，汗流浃背。他似乎刚刚才知道自己所作的一切，并且答应逃到地球上与世隔绝的地方去，确保自己不会再伤害任何人。但是，诅咒仍然存在。他从你的眼中发现了诅咒，然后紧紧抓住你的手臂。“别让诅咒控制住你。”他警告说，“我是个弱者，但你——我看得出你很强。我没法控制诅咒，但你可以。”"
