"People don’t care about the ones who get left behind. That’s the first thing you learned on the street, after you left the orphanage. You’ve had to fend for yourself, do whatever you can to scrape by. So far, with just your wits and the amulet Mama left you before they took her away, you’ve managed to survive. Occasionally, someone will show some compassion and throw a coin or two into your cup. One glorious morning, a nice lady leaving Velma’s gave you her leftover sausage and eggs. But for the most part, you’ve only had yourself to rely on. The other street rats might be in the same boat as you, but you would hesitate to call any of them friends, save for maybe James, and that is a stretch. No—hunger, loneliness, boredom, and doubt are your best and only friends. And despite all that, it’s still somehow better than the orphanage.\n"
"Then the fateful day arrived. It began like any other, with you and James working your way through Rivertown, “collecting” anything you might be able to sell to Oliver Thomas. The rest would surely go to Marvin’s gang—a bunch of street kids who banded together to bully the rest—but there is one trinket among your earnings that sparks your eye: a photograph. Not just any photograph, but one of your father.\n"
"It is unmistakable. There is no doubt in your mind. In the photo, your father stands in front of a building you don’t recognize. The sign behind him looks to be in a different language, so probably someplace far, far away. There’s no way of telling how recently the photo was taken. It is worn, dirty, and nicked in several places. You turn it over and there, scrawled in familiar handwriting, you read: “Soon the Red Tide rises. Stay safe, my little girl.”\n"
"You beg James to tell you where the photo came from, and he claims a man in a long wool coat and a dark brown derby dropped it in your cup sometime before you ran into Marvin’s gang. You set off at once, asking around to find the man in the derby. Your only lead is that he hopped on a bus near Easttown. The decrepit, unmarked bus that runs to the harbor town of Innsmouth. You scrounge up as many coins as you can and board the only bus to the old, forsaken seaport. If Dad is still out there, you have to find him. You have to!"

"大家都不会在乎那些被遗弃的人。这是你离开孤儿院后，流落街头时学到的第一件事。你必须自谋生计，尽力而为才能勉强度日。到目前为止，凭藉著你的机智和妈妈被他们带走之前留给你的护身符，你成功地活了下来。偶尔，有人会展现一点同情心，往你的杯子里扔一两枚硬币。某个愉快的早晨，一位离开维尔玛餐馆的善良女士把她剩下的香肠和鸡蛋给了你。但大多数情况下，你只能靠自己。其他流浪街头的小鬼可能和你处境相同，但你犹豫是否要把他们中的任何人当作是朋友，也许詹姆斯可以，但也很勉强。不——饥饿、孤单、无聊和猜疑是你最好，也是唯一的朋友。尽管如此，这还是比待在孤儿院更好。\n"
"然后命运性的一天到来了。一开始就像其他平凡的日子，你和詹姆斯一路穿过河岸城，沿路“收集”任何你可能可以卖给奥利弗·托马斯的东西。剩下的肯定会被马尔文的帮派——一群流浪儿联合起来欺负其他流浪儿——搜括走。但在你的战利品中，有一个小饰品让你眼前一亮：一张照片。那不是一张普通的照片，是你爸爸的照片。\n"
"你绝不会弄错，心中确信无疑。照片里，你爸爸站在一栋你不认得的建筑物前面。他身后的标志看起来是不同的语言，所以可能是在很远很远的某个地方。你没有办法知道这张照片是多久拍摄的。照片有好几个地方都磨损、污渍和缺口了。你把它翻过来，上面熟悉而潦草的字迹写著：“赤潮很快就会升起。保持安全，我的女儿。”\n"
"你哀求詹姆斯告诉你这张照片是从哪里来的，他宣称在你遇到马尔文的帮派前的某个时候，一个穿著长羊毛外套和深棕色圆顶硬帽的男人把它丢进了你的杯子里。你立即行动，四处打听，寻找那个戴著圆顶硬帽的人。你唯一的线索是他在东城区附近跳上了一辆巴士。那辆破旧、无标记的巴士是开往港口城镇印斯茅斯的。你尽你所能地搜刮硬币，然后坐上唯一的巴士路线，前往古老、失落的海港。如果爸爸还在那里，你一定要找到他，一定要！"

"You didn’t find Dad, but you were able to find the next best thing: the man in the brown derby. You approach casually, hoping he’ll ignore you like everyone else tends to do, so you can confront him. You follow him into a dark alley and immediately realize he’s leading you somewhere hidden away from prying eyes. “Didn’t think you’d follow me,” he says once you’re alone.\n"
"The questions come pouring out of you. Does he know your father? Where is he? Why the photo? What is the Red Tide? But he simply holds up a finger to his lips. “Shhh, kid. You’re gonna get me killed.” He sighs, removes his cap, and runs his trembling fingers through oily hair. “Look, all I can tell you is…your Dad, he fell in with some bad people. Some real scary people. But he wanted out. And the only way out…” he grimaces and shakes his head. “You gotta understand. He can’t come home. You’d be in danger. So would he. But…he still wanted you to know that he loves you. So…”\n"
"You wipe a stray tear that threatens to crawl down your cheek. The man looks terrified. He’s either a world-class actor, or he’s telling the truth. You ask him one last question—who are the bad people Dad fell in with?—but the moment you ask, he shakes his head and backs away. “I’ve already said too much!” is the last thing he says before he flees."

"你没有找到爸爸，但退而求其次，你找到了戴著棕色圆顶硬帽的男人。你假装随意地靠近，希望他会像其他人一样忽视你，这样你就可以面对他。你跟著他走进一条黑暗的小巷，立即就意识到他正在将你带离开到不受窥探的地方。“没想到你会跟著我，”等到你独自一人时，他说道。\n"
"问题从你身上倾泻而出。他认识你爸爸吗？他在哪里？照片是为什么？什么是赤潮？但他只是将一根手指放在嘴边。“嘘，孩子。你会害死我的。”他叹了口气，摘下帽子，将颤抖的手指抚过油腻的头发。“听著，我只能告诉你……你爸爸，他结交了一些坏人，一些很可怕的人。他想抽身，但唯一的出路……”他做了个厌恶的表情，摇摇头。“你得明白，他无法回家。你会有危险，他也会。但是……他还是想让你知道他爱你。所以……”\n"
"你擦去一滴快要从脸颊上滴落的眼泪。这个男人看起来很害怕。如果他不是超一流的演员，那他说的就是实话。你问他最后一个问题——和爸爸在一起的坏人是谁？——但你的问题一说出口，他立刻摇了摇头，转身离开。“我已经说太多了！”这是他逃走前留下的最后一句话。"

msgid "You wait for your pursuers to round the corner before making your way stealthily back to the bus stop and getting on the next bus to Arkham. You crumple the sides of Dad’s photo in anger. A stray teardrop trails down your cheek. You still have no real leads. Who was the man in the derby and the wool coat that morning? What have you gotten yourself mixed up with? But, glancing once more at the photo, one hope still lingers in your mind: Dad is alive. He has to be."
