msgid ""
"You’ve always known there was something…different…about you. From a young age, in your dreams, you saw another realm. Another life. One of magick and majesty, of conquest and persecution. The moment you found that strange, old key—the moment you recognized the filigree along its handle, the pattern of its teeth—you knew those dreams weren’t dreams at all, but memories. Memories of another life. Of a place called “Hyperborea.” And as the memories returned, the magic did, too.\n"
"For months you practiced in secret, delving into your memories and honing your powers. But lately, your dreams have turned dark and grisly. Your former self was not as caring or forviging as you. She was ruthless. Power-hungry. Terrible to behold. You’ve taken it upon yourself to wield these strange powers only to help others, and not to hurt them.\n"
"But you’re not the only one whose memories have started to return. Elspeth Baudin first visited the diner a few weeks ago. In the beginning, she was just a patron like any other. She ordered eggs, bacon and a black coffee, not unlike many of the other customers at Velma’s. But there was something in her eyes— some spark of recognition or curiosity—that made you wary of her.\n"
"Then came the questions.\n"
"First, she asked about the key you wore on a chain around your neck. You gave her your best smile and told her your usual lie—that it was a family heirloom, a harmless trinket with no worth but its sentimental value. But that didn’t deter her. She started prying about your life, about your family…about your dreams.\n"
"Elspeth was no normal patron. She wasn’t making small talk. She was looking for answers, just the same as you. So you did some digging of your own. But there were no records of Elspeth being a resident of Arkham, and the few people you found who knew of her spoke only in hushed, frightened voices, and gave you very little to work with.\n"
"Then came a call from the Curiositie Shoppe in Northside. Elspeth had been searching for more artifacts like your own “hierloom,” even going so far as to utter the name Hyperborea. She is searching for something that can unlock more of her memories, just like you…but she is <i>not</i> like you. That sinister smirk of hers, the way her contacts trembled with fear at the mention of her name—you shudder to think what somebody with foul intentions could do with the sort of powers your memories hold…"

"一直以来，你都知道你与其众不同。从小时候起，你就在梦中看到了另一个国度；另一种生活。那是一种充满魔法和威严、征服和迫害的生活。在你发现那把奇怪的、古老的钥匙——当你认出手柄上的雕饰和钥匙的形式——的那一刻，你就意识到那些梦根本不是梦，而是记忆；前世的记忆。那是一个叫做“希波利尔”的地方。随著记忆涌现，魔力也恢复了。\n"
"几个月来，你一直在秘密地练习，深入研究自己的记忆并磨练自己的力量。但最近，你的梦境变得黯淡和阴沉。前世的你没有现在的你那么关怀和宽容。她残酷、渴望力量、难以相处。你已经决定好要妥善运用这些奇异的力量，用来帮助他人，而不是伤害他们。\n"
"但你并不是唯一一个开始找回记忆的人。爱尔佩丝·博丹几周前第一次来到餐厅。一开始，她就只是一个平凡的顾客。她点了鸡蛋、培根和一杯黑咖啡，就像维尔玛餐馆里的其他顾客一样。但是她的眼睛里有些什么——一种确认或好奇的光芒，让你心生警惕。\n"
"然后问题就来了。\n"
"起初，她问了你戴在脖子的项炼上的钥匙。你挤出一个完美的笑容，并告诉了她你平时准备好的谎言——那是家族的传家宝，一个无害的小饰品，没什么价值，只有纪念意义。但这并没有阻止她。她开始刺探您的生活、家庭……甚至你的梦境。\n"
"爱尔佩丝不是一般的顾客。她不是在跟你闲聊，她在寻找她想要的答案，就跟你一样。因此，你自己做了一些调查。没有任何记录表明爱尔佩丝住在阿卡姆，而且你发现少数几个与她有接触的人，说话的声音都很微弱，充满恐惧，几乎对你没有任何帮助。\n"
"然后，位于北区的珍品店给你打了一通电话。爱尔佩丝一直在寻找更多的文物，类似你的“传家宝”，或是名字里带有“希波利尔”的东西。她正在寻找可以释放更多记忆的东西，像你一样……但是她<i>不</i>像你。你想起她那阴险的笑容，还有接触到她的人一听到她的名字，就因恐惧而颤抖的模样——一想到如果怀有恶意的人拥有你的记忆里的那种力量之后，能做出什么事，你不禁感到不寒而栗……"

msgid "It would be so simple. You could end her right now. Prevent her from menacing others with her powers…But then, would you be any different? You lower your hand, and the magic disperses into the cold air. “Why?” she asks, her voice cracked with pain. You shake your head and tell her that she is wrong. True power is the ability to make peace, not the ability to wage war. “Fool,” she barks, clambering to her feet. “You are a weakling, after all. And you will regret letting me live.” You watch her amble off with only fragments of her former life in her head. Her powers are considerably drained, but she still poses a problem. Perhaps you should have dealt with her, as she said. Still, you breathe a sigh of relief. You don’t want this power to change who you are. You won’t let yourself become like her. No matter what."
msgstr "你可以很简单地结束她的性命。一劳永逸地阻止她滥用这些力量威胁他人……但是如果这么做，你又会与她有什么差别呢？你放下手，魔力消散在冷冽的空气中。“为什么？”她问道，她的声音因疼痛而断断续续。你摇摇头，告诉她她错了。真正的力量是建立和平的能力，而不是发动战争的能力。“蠢蛋，”她叫道，勉强站起来。“最终你还是这么软弱。你会后悔让我活下去的。”你看著她缓慢地离去，她脑海中前世的记忆仅存破碎的片段，力量已几乎被消耗殆尽。但她仍然是个问题，也许你应该如她所说地对付她。不过，你还是松了一口气。你不希望这股力量改变了你。无论如何，你不会让自己变得像她一样。"

msgid "Elspeth has you at her mercy. She raises her hand, her magic threatening to tear you apart. She smirks. You close your eyes and brace yourself…but no killing blow comes. Instead, she yanks you to your feet and wipes dust off your apron. “Come now,” she purrs with a devilish grin. “You are no whimpering animal. Don’t you remember what you truly are? What we truly are?” Then, without any further punishment, she departs, leaving you with only fragments of your former life."
msgstr "爱尔佩丝完全制伏了你。她举起手，魔力威胁著要把你撕成碎片。她冷笑著，你闭上眼睛，作好了心理准备……但致命一击没有到来。取而代之的是，她粗鲁地拉你起来，擦去你围裙上的灰尘。“来，”她带著坏笑说道。“你可不是哭哭啼啼的小动物。你不记得自己的本性了吗？我们的本性？”然后，她没有再对你做什么就离开了，只留下你，与你仅存的破碎前世记忆。"
