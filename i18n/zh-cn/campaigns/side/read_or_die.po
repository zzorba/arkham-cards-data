"You’ve spent your entire life reading. As a child, it was but a simple interest in harmless stories. Grisly stories, to be sure, but harmless nonetheless. Your fascination with horror and the macabre earned you the nickname “Spooks” among your friends and classmates. But as you grew, so too did this fascination, until it bordered on obsession. Your appetite for horror evolved from mystery and make-believe to something more. Something <i>real</i>.\n"
"When you discovered John Dee’s translation of The Necronomicon, you knew you’d finally found the true horror you had been secretly yearning for. If only you’d known what would be in store for you once you’d read that dreadful tome. You would have locked it back up in Henry Armitage’s restricted collection in the Orne Library and never opened it again.\n"
"Or so you like to think. But even you cannot doubt the allure of the <i>Kitab al-Azif</i>. The Book of the Dead. That is why, when Dr. Armitage summoned you to the Orne Library, the dread in your bones predicted precisely what had occurred.\n"
"“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” Dr. Armitage says as he surveys the destruction. The entire restricted collection is in tattered disarray. The Necronomicon lies open on a nearby table, its metal clasps broken apart. You run your fingers along its leathery, skin-like pages. Your eyes flit along the words in a familiar dance:\n"
"<center><i>“They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness.”</i></center>\n"
"Your throat tightens as you realize what must have occurred. Something has been unleashed, and you are the only one who can figure out how to stop it…"

"你一辈子都在读书。小时候，只是简单地沉浸在无害的故事之中。确切地说，尽管故事很吓人，却是无害的。你对恐怖和惊悚的迷恋使你在朋友和同学中赢得了“吓人精”的绰号。但是随著你的年龄增长，这种迷恋也跟著成长，渐渐地变成了一种痴迷。神秘和虚构开始无法满足你对恐怖的胃口，你渴望更<i>真实</i>的东西。\n"
"当你发现约翰·迪伊的《死灵之书》译本时，你知道自己终于找到了一直暗暗渴望的真正恐怖。只要你读完这本可怕的书，你就会知道有什么正在等待著你。然后你就会将它深锁在奥恩图书馆的亨利·阿米蒂奇的禁忌藏书区，永远不再打开。\n"
"也许，这只是你喜欢的幻想。然而你也无法抗拒《死灵之书》—亡者的典籍—的魅力。这就是为什么当阿米蒂奇博士召唤你到奥恩图书馆时，你所感到的刺骨恐惧精确地预测了发生了什么事。\n"
"「我不知道怎么会发生这种事，」阿米蒂奇博士在调查破坏时说道。整个禁忌收藏都变得乱七八糟。《死灵之书》躺在附近的桌子上，书上的金属扣环断裂。你的手指滑过皮革般、有著皮肤触感的书页。你的眼睛随著每个字跳动，像是跳著一支熟悉的舞蹈：\n"
"<center><i>“他们走在偏僻的地方，看不见且污秽，圣言在这里被道出，仪式在他们的季节里喧嚣。狂风鼓噪著他们的声音，大地低语著他们的意识。”</i></center>\n"
"当你意识到将要需发生的事情时，你的喉咙一紧。有什么东西已经被释放了，而你是唯一知道该如何阻止它的人……"
