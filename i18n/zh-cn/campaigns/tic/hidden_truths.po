"As soon as your mind returned to the present, you began formulating your plan. A plan to enter the realm of the Deep Ones and end their conspiracy once and for all. \"This is ridiculous, you know that, right?\" Harper asks. You nod. Of course it's ridiculous. You've spent the last two days on the run. Chased. Hunted. Tormented.\n"
"But you've also spent the last two days recovering the memories you've forgotten. And what you've seen is something you can't possibly ignore. You have seen the deity the Esoteric Order of Dagon is named for, and you understand what the Order plans to do. The alignment of the celestial bodies in the sky, the steadily rising tides, the tumultuous fluctuating weather, the creatures emerging from the deep, all of it is tied together. You have seen it. There will come a flood, a great disaster to wipe out humanity, so only the deep remains. The great city in the reef shall rise once more and become the beating heart of all life on Earth.\n"
"There are still gaps in your memory, but all this you know to be true. All of Innsmouth is consumed by this conspiracy. The Order controlled the town through its oaths and the secret wealth it hoarded from the deep. It was no wonder they treated outsiders like yourself with such scorn.\n"
"You give Harper a knowing glare. She sighs and nods. \"I know. It's the only way.\" Together, the two of you plot your course. Abandoned ships still litter the harbor of Innsmouth. Under the cover of night, you must commandeer one of them, sail to Devil Reef, and descend once more into the antediluvian ruins in the depths below the forsaken islands. That is where the other entrance to the city lies. Y'ha-nthlei.\n"
"Your skin prickles with cold shivers as you utter the word aloud. Harper grimaces, though you can sense the determination behind her steely gaze. \"I'm going to see this mission through, Dawson. For you.\"\n"
"You lay out all of the information you've uncovered and the relics you've obtained despite the horrors arrayed against you. You know the way to Y'ha-nthlei is sealed tight. There must be a way to gain entrance. Perhaps you already have the answers you seek…"

"你的意识一回到现在，就开始构思下一步的计划。构思要怎么进入深潜者领域，一劳永逸地终结这场暗潮。“这可真是荒谬。是吧？”哈珀问道。你点点头。这当然荒谬。你过去两天都疲于奔命。疲于追兵。疲于猎手。疲于折磨。\n"
"但你已经花了两天恢复忘却的记忆。你瞧见的东西肯定不能忽略。你已经看见了达贡密教得名的神灵，理解了密教到底想干什么。排列一线的天体，不断上涨的浪潮，狂怒起伏的天气，深海涌现的怪物，这些如今都联系起来了。你看见了。将会有一场大洪灾扫除全人类，所留唯有深海。礁石中的巨城将再度升起，成为世界上所有生命的鼓动心脏。\n"
"虽然你的记忆仍有空缺，但你所知的一切确是实事。整个印斯茅斯都被暗潮吞没。密教用誓约和深海潜藏的秘密财富控制了整个村镇。他们为何如此轻蔑地对待像你一样的外来者，也就不足为奇了。\n"
"你向哈珀投去一个了然的眼神。她叹了口气，点了点头：“我明白。只有这一条路。”你俩共商大计。印斯茅斯的码头上还散著废弃的船只。在夜色下，你们肯定能抢上一艘开到魔鬼礁石去，再次潜入遗忘岛屿底下深处的洪荒古城。这里就是城市的另一个入口。伊哈·恩斯雷。\n"
"你大声说话的时候，皮肤一阵冷颤和刺痛。哈珀挤了个苦脸，但你能察觉到她冷峻的眼神中包含的决心。“我会让任务完成的，道森。就当是为了你。”\n"
"尽管恐惧袭来，但你还是将自己发现的所有信息全然吐露，也拿出了自己找到的遗物。你知道通往伊哈·恩斯雷的道路已严密封印。但肯定还有办法能进去。也许你已经找到了自己想要的答案……"

msgid "You study the trophy you found in the sacrificial pit in which you awoke several days ago—part of what was once the creature that you fought in Devil Reef. It wasn't the same kind of creature as the \"Deep Ones\" that the Esoteric Order of Dagon worships, but you cannot help ruminating over the similarities between them. You recall that fish never cease growing as they age, and wonder if the same may be true for Deep Ones. Perhaps it was an ancient breed of Deep Ones—something so old, it grew enormous and twisted beyond imagination. If so what was it doing in Devil Reef? Was it guarding Y'ha-nthlei? And if so, what does that bode for you? You decide to take the trophy with you, hoping it is important enough to aid in your mission…"
msgstr "你研究了自己几周前在牺牲深坑中找到的战利品——也就是你曾在魔鬼礁石搏斗过的怪物。这和达贡密教崇拜的“深潜者”不是一类生物，但你不禁开始思考他们之间的相似性。你回想起鱼的生长永无休止，好奇深潜者是否也是如此。也许这是一种古代的深潜者——过于古老，已经长得超越想象的庞大和扭曲。如果真是如此，那它在魔鬼礁石是为何？它是在守卫伊哈·恩斯雷吗？若真是如此，这对你来说又意味著什么？你决定带著战利品上路，希望它足够重要，能在任务中帮上忙……"

Now the relic recognizes you as its rightful heir. Perhaps with this, you will be able to gain entrance to Y'ha-nthlei…"
msgstr "你现在知道了你在魔鬼礁石下找到的遗物究竟意味著什么。这不只是一件极具力量的器皿。这是一种标记——一件传家宝，属于深潜者之城大门的守卫者。你击败了原本的下一任守卫。现在遗物认可你是正统的继任了。兴许有了这个，你就能进入伊哈·恩斯雷……"
