"You stand outside the cracked marble steps leading up to the masonic hall of the Esoteric Order of Dagon. All of the evidence has lead you here. Whatever is going on in this town, this Order is behind it. You're sure of it… though their ultimate goal remains a mystery.\n"
"The town is eerily quiet as you stand before the building's entrance. Once, this place might have been impressive and opulent. Years of disrepair and flood damage have reduced it to a near-ruin. Its once-white paint is gray and peeling, and many of the pillars outside the entryway are beginning to crumble. Still, it is one of the more intimidating places in Innsmouth, projecting authority despite its decrepitude. No, not authority—something darker. A looming, unspoken threat.\n"
"\"Are you ready?\" Agent Dawson asks. His usually calm demeanor has vanished, replaced with a humorless gravity that throws you off guard. \"This is it. This is where we'll find answers.\"\n"
"You're not so sure. Every other lead you've followed has led to only more questions."

"你站在破损的大理石阶梯外，这里直通向达贡密教的共济会礼堂。所有的证据都把你引向这里。无论村子里发生了什么，背后肯定都是密教。你对此十分确定……但密教的最终目的仍然是谜。\n"
"你站在这幢建筑门前的时候，村子里一片诡异的寂静。这地方过去肯定壮观华丽。但年久失修，又有洪水侵蚀，这里已经快成了一片废墟。曾经雪白的墙壁如今发灰剥落，入口外许多立柱也开始坍圮。尽管已经老旧，但这仍是村子里最为威严的建筑，彰显著权威。不，不是权威——是什么更为黑暗的东西。一种若隐若现、难以言喻的威胁。\n"
"“你准备好了吗？”道森特工问道。他寻常的冷静已经消失，如今毫无幽默的严肃倒是让你措手不及。“就是这儿了。这儿就是我们找到答案的地方。”\n"
"对此你可不敢确定。你追踪的其他线索，每一条都只是引出了更多的问题。"

"Agent Harper was kidnapped when she got too close to the Order, but interrogating her kidnapper didn't exactly yield the answers you needed. What you know now is that the Order's influence pervades Innsmouth, from important civic figures to everyday citizens. Finances, religion, politics… everything is wrapped up in this cult's business in some way or another. What's worse, many of the town's inhabitants seem to follow the Order with blind, fanatical devotion. So many that you're not sure this is even a functioning town anymore. It's no wonder the people are so hostile towards outsiders.\n"
"It wasn't until your investigation of Devil Reef that you truly began to peel away the outer layers of Innsmouth and reveal the rot beneath. There, you found what the Order was hiding: the monstrous creatures that emerged from the depths and prowled the tidal islands, congregating in prayers to some horrific deity. Perhaps it is even the same \"Dagon\" worshipped by the Order."

"哈珀特工接近密教的时候遭到了绑架，但盘问她的绑匪并没有给出你想要的答案。你现在知道密教的影响力已经渗入了印斯茅斯，从重要的大人物到日常小民。金融、宗教、政治……这个密教已经用各种手段缠上了每件事。更糟的是，许多村民都盲目、狂热地向密教献身。这样的人太多，以至于你根本无法确认这个村子是否还正常。毫无疑问，这里的人对外来者并无善意。\n"
"直到调查了魔鬼礁石，你才真正抽丝剥茧，揭开了印斯茅斯的外皮，发现了底下潜藏的腐败。你在那儿发现了密教隐藏的东西：从海底涌现的怪异生物。它们逡巡于岸边的礁岛，一同向骇人的神灵祈祷。或许就是密教崇拜的同一个“达贡”。"

Your own investigation might have ended the same way had you not laid low for a week after the townsfolk got riled up. It seems that the Order's influence pervades Innsmouth, from important civic figures to everyday citizens. Finances, religion, politics… everything is wrapped up in this cult's business in some way or another. But why?\n"

"This place is more dangerous than you could have possibly imagined. You stumble as you flee through the dark, flooded corridors, retracing your steps as quickly as you can to reach the entrance. Your heart races in your chest as you see the exit at last. You gasp in relief as you crash through the doors, to safety—\n"
"—Only you are not safe. Standing at the bottom of the steps is an angry throng of citizens, far too many for you to fight your way through. \"There! Get 'em!\" a wrinkled women at the head of the mob shouts. You are surrounded and grabbed within moments. You struggle and fight for your life, but it's no use. The last thing you remember is being dragged back through the halls of the Order to some unknown fate…"

"You're somewhere else now, lying on your stomach on cold, damp stone. Your arms are held tight behind your back. You have no idea how you got here. As consciousness returns, your vision comes into focus. You crane your neck up to view your surroundings, but it's too dark to see anything inside your stone cell.\n"
"\"I'll ask you one last time. Who sent you here?\" a voice asks. It is deep and husky, like the croaking of a frog.\n"
"You hear the familiar, cool baritone of Agent Dawson reply: \"Your breath smells awful. Ever heard of brushing your teeth?\" Despite the sarcasm dripping from his words, his voice wavers ever so slightly.\n"
"\"Your mockery only masks the fear that hides within,\" the voice replies. \"Very well. If you are of no use to us, you will be the first to be sacrificed.\"\n"
"Your vision continues to adjust. You can just barely make out Dawson's silhouette on the other side of the cell. He is kneeling before a metal hatch in the stone floor. An elderly robed figure presses a curved knife against Dawson's throat. Someone lifts the hatch, and Dawson's eyes go wide. He gives you one last despairing look, shakes his head slowly and deliberately, and quietly slides something across the stone floor. Then the hooded figure pushes him in. In the scuffle and the low light, nobody notices the car key that skitters to a halt directly next to you.\n"
"You grab the key and stuff it into your pocket just before you are shoved forward. Two more sets of cold, clammy hands grasp your shoulders, and the hooded figure slides his knife up to your neck. All you can see of his face are his wide, unblinking eyes.\n"
"\"Oceiros, these ones were found in Dagon's lair as well,\" another voice explains to the elderly figure in the robes. \"We believe they were the ones snooping around Devil Reef.\"\n"
"The man with the knife to your throat nods. \"Your turn,\" he declares. \"Tell us why you have come and perhaps we will let you go. Who sent you? What have you seen?\""

"你现在身处别处，肚皮著地倒在冰冷潮湿的石头上。你的双臂紧绑在背后。你并不知道自己是怎么来的。意识回归，你的视线开始聚焦。你伸长脖子，想看看周围，但四周太暗，根本看不清囚室里的任何东西。\n"
"“我再问你最后一遍。是谁派你来的？”一个声音问道。这声音低沉沙哑，彷佛青蛙的咕呱。\n"
"你听到了道森特工熟悉、冷酷的男低音：“你闻起来真是糟透了。你听说过‘刷牙’这回事吗？”尽管他言辞犀利，但音调的变化甚微。\n"
"“你的嘲弄不过是在掩饰自己的恐惧。”那个声音答道，“也罢。既然你派不上用场，那就拿你做第一个祭品。”\n"
"你的视线开始适应了。你勉强能看出厅室另一端道森的身影。他跪在石头地板上一个金属活板门前。一个披著长袍的老者将弯刀抵在道森的喉咙上。有人打开了门，道森瞪大了眼睛。他最后向你投来一个绝望的眼神，缓缓地、刻意地摇了摇头，然后将什么东西悄悄地滑过石地面。然后那个披著长袍的人就把他推了进去。在扭打的喧嚣和如此暗沉的灯光之中，没人注意到一路划过地面的车钥匙停在了你面前。\n"
"你抓起钥匙，塞进口袋。刚做完你就被推上前去。一双冰冷湿黏的手抓住了你的肩膀，长袍人将刀子抵在了你的脖子上。他的脸上你能看到的就是那双不会眨的大眼睛。\n"
"“奥赛罗思，这人也是在达贡巢穴里找到的。”另一个声音向披著长袍的老者解释道，“我们觉著这就是在魔鬼礁石刺探的人了。”\n"
"刀尖抵著你喉咙的男子点了点头。“轮到你了。”他宣道，“讲讲你为何至此，兴许我们会放你走。谁派你来的？你都看到什么了？”"

Inside, you see nothing but darkness. You glare long and hard at your captor.\n"
"\"Take what they have stolen to the lighthouse at once,\" Oceiros commands one of the other robed figures. \"It is time to begin our great work. None will disrupt the Order's business ever again.

You tell him that you have never met that man before in your life. \"Perhaps you speak the truth,\" the man says, and you breathe a short-lived sigh of relief before he dashes your hopes: \"…but it matters not.
