"This expansion introduces key tokens that represent important objects or pieces of information that can be claimed and used during scenarios.\n"
"Key tokens have two sides. When facedown, all seven keys have the same universal key symbol, so they can be randomized without the investigators knowing which is which. When faceup, each key is color coded with a unique color.\n"
"If a scenario uses one or more keys, the setup of that scenario indicates how many are set aside and whether they should be faceup or randomized facedown. Keys can enter play via several different card effects, and they are usually placed on enemy, location, or story asset. Keys can be acquired in any of three ways:"

"本扩展引入了钥匙标记，代表了在冒险期间会获得或使用的重要物件或信息。\n"
"钥匙标记有正反两面。所有七个钥匙的背面颜色都一样，这样就可以随机打乱，使调查员无法分辨。每个钥匙的正面皆由不同的颜色标明，每种颜色代表不同的事物。\n"
"如果一场冒险用到了钥匙，则该冒险的设置会指示有多少个钥匙会放在一边；以及钥匙是正面朝上，还是正面朝下随机打乱。钥匙可以通过不同的卡牌效果入场，通常是被放在敌人、地点，或剧情支援上。以下是三种获取钥匙的方法："

msgid "If a location with a key on it has no clues, an investigator may take control of each of that location's keys as a [fast] ability."
msgstr "作为一个[fast]能力，如果带有钥匙的地点上没有线索，调查员可以控制该地点的所有钥匙。"

msgid "If an investigator causes an enemy with a key on it to leave play, that investigator must take control of each of the keys that were on that enemy. (If it leaves play through some other means, place its keys on its location.)"
msgstr "如果带有钥匙的敌人离场，导致该敌人离场的调查员必须控制该敌人上的每个钥匙。(如果敌人因其他方式离场，将其钥匙放在其所在地点上。)"

msgid "Some card effects may allow an investigator to take control of keys in other ways."
msgstr "某些卡牌效果可能允许调查员以其他方式控制钥匙。"

msgid ""
"When an investigator takes control of a key, they flip it faceup (if it is facedown) and place it on their investigator card. If an investigator who controls one or more keys is eliminated, place each of their keys on their locations. As an [action] ability, an investigator may give any number of their keys to another investigator at the same location.\n"
"<b>Keys have no inherent game effect.</b> However, some card effects may change depending on which keys an investigator controls. Additionally, keys may sometimes be required in order to progress during a scenario."
msgstr ""
"调查员在控制钥匙时，将其翻至正面朝上(如果其正面朝下)，并将其放在自己的调查员卡上。如果控制钥匙的调查员退场，将其所有钥匙放在其所在地点上。作为一个[action]能力，调查员可以将其任意数量的钥匙给予同一地点的另一位调查员。\n"
"<b>钥匙本身没有游戏效果。</b>不过，某些卡牌效果会根据调查员控制了什么钥匙而发生改变。此外，冒险期间的进程有时会对钥匙有需求。"

msgid "Flood Tokens"
msgstr "淹没标记"

msgid "Throughout the campaign, scenario card effects can flood locations. Each location has one of three different flood levels: it is either unflooded, partially flooded, or fully flooded. A location's flood level can be tracked using the double-sided flood tokens included in this deluxe box. <b>A location's flood level has no inherent game effect.</b> However, some card effects may change or become stronger while you are at a flooded location, particularly if that location is fully flooded."
msgstr "在本剧本中，冒险卡效果会淹没地点。地点共有三种不同的淹没等级：未淹没、部分淹没，或完全淹没。地点的淹没等级由本豪华扩展中带有的双面淹没标记记录。<b>地点的淹没等级本身没有游戏效果。</b>不过，你位于淹没地点时，有些卡牌效果可能发生改变或强化——尤其是你位于完全淹没地点时。"

msgid "A location with no flood tokens is unflooded."
msgstr "没有淹没标记的地点即为未淹没。"

msgid "If a location becomes partially flooded, place a flood token on it with the partially flooded side faceup to designate this."
msgstr "如果地点变为部分淹没，在上面放置一个淹没标记，以部分淹没面朝上，作为标识。"

msgid "If a location becomes fully fooded, place a flood token on it with the fully flooded side faceup (or if it is already partially flooded, flip its flood token over) to designate this."
msgstr "如果地点变为完全淹没，在上面放置一个淹没标记，以完全淹没面朝上(或者如果其已为部分淹没，则将淹没标记翻面)，作为标识。"

msgid "If a location's flood level is \"increased\", it changes from unflooded to partially flooded, or from partially flooded to fully flooded. A fully flooded location cannot have its flood level increased."
msgstr "如果地点的淹没等级“提升”，则其从未淹没变为部分淹没，或从部分淹没变为完全淹没。已经完全淹没的地点淹没等级不能提升。"

msgid "If a location's flood level is \"decreased\", it changes from fully flooded to partially flooded, or from partially flooded to unflooded. If a location becomes unflooded, remove its flood token."
msgstr "如果地点的淹没等级“降低”，则其从完全淹没变为部分淹没，或从部分淹没变为未淹没。如果地点变为未淹没，移除其淹没标记。"

msgid "For the purposes of card effects, both partially flooded locations and fully flooded locations are considered to be \"flooded.\""
msgstr "若有卡牌效果提及，部分淹没和完全淹没的地点都视为“淹没”。"
