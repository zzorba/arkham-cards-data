"The drive home to Arkham is quiet. After everything you have been through, you would have thought the quiet to be a peaceful reprieve… but you are alone with your thoughts-thoughts of Innsmouth, of Deep Ones, of enormous monsters dwelling in the depths beneath the waves. You find yourself checking your rearview mirror regularly, waiting to spot the headlights of pursuers who want you dead; the glowing, unblinking eyes of an aquatic horror in your back seat; or perhaps even the cold, dead glare of Thomas Dawson, mutated nearly beyond recognition. But you see nothing. Just an empty road.\n"
"You sigh and run through the events of the past few weeks once more. You believe you have a complete picture of what occurred, and yet you still feel like there is something missing. Another gap in your memories…"

"开回阿卡姆一路寂静。历经种种，你只想安静地歇一会儿……但思绪始终萦绕不去——有关印斯茅斯、深潜者，还有海浪之下、深渊之中寄居的无穷怪物。你发现自己正不断查看后视镜，等著里面出现追击者的车灯，要取你性命；等著后座出现那些水生怪物一眨不眨的发亮眼睛；又或者是死去的托马斯·道森冰冷的凝视——他已经突变得认不出来。但你什么都没有看见。唯有空空的道路。\n"
"你叹了口气，又回顾了一番过去几周发生的事情。你相信自己已得见全貌，但又觉得还是落下了什么。你的记忆中还是有所缺失……"

msgid "…you shake the feeling away. It doesn't matter anymore. This whole ordeal is behind you now. Innsmouth, Dagon, Hydra, Y'ha-nthlei-just a terrible memory you wish you could forget, like all those other memories you lost. Your foot lies heavy on the accelerator. The faster you are away from this hellish place, the better."
msgstr "……你挥挥手，赶走这份思绪。但这都无关紧要了。整场祸事现在都已被你抛在身后。印斯茅斯、达贡、海德拉、伊哈·恩斯雷这些都不过是你想要忘掉的可怕记忆罢了，就像是你已经失去的其他记忆一样。你重重地踩了一脚油门。越快离开这鬼地方越好。"

"You are back in Agent Dawson's office in Boston. He has stepped out for only a brief moment in order to retrieve some documents for you to sign. Some kind of agreement not to speak of anything you might see or hear while working for the government, no doubt. Several minutes pass. You begin to wander throughout the office, examining the many books and maps Dawson has scattered around. Some are harmless enough-a medical textbook, a history of New England, a treatise on the anatomy of aquatic creatures throughout the Atlantic-but the volumes get stranger and stranger the more of his collection you examine.\n"
"Venturing nearer to Dawson's side of the office, you notice that the many books, envelopes, and documents spread across the surface of his desk lie atop an unfolded map. You decide to chance a peek, hoping Dawson's task will keep him from his office for a while longer. Pushing some of the objects in your way aside, you examine the map. It is an enormous nautical chart of the world's oceans, marked in many spots with fresh black ink. A fountain pen lies nearby.\n"
"The marks that Dawson has made are curious, to say the least. There are over a dozen scattered across the seas. Some lie just off the coast of various continents, while others are in the middle of the ocean, their locations marked with wide, unfilled circles to show that their exact coordinates are unknown. Strange words are scribbled next to each. P'tha'wei in the north Atlantic, near Greenland. Yhe'nthalla in the south Atlantic, just off the coast of Africa. R'lyeh deep in the south Pacific. Th'all-iewa by Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean. And at least ten more, some marked with question marks-an indication that this record is incomplete. You gently push aside the book that lies atop North America and see one more just off the coast of Massachusetts. Y'ha-nthlei.\n"
"You slam the brakes and screech to a halt as your mind pulls back to the present. <i>No. It can't be.</i> Your heart twists into a knot as you realize the truth. <i>No-!</i>\n"
"Y'ha-nthlei was not the home of the Deep Ones. It was just one of many."

"你闪回到了道森特工在波士顿的办公室。他出去片刻，去拿几份要你签署的文件。不用怀疑，肯定是些协议，让你不要泄露自己为政府工作期间的所见所闻。几分钟过去了。你在办公室里踱步，检查道森散落的书籍和地图。有些显然无害——医学教科书、新英格兰历史，还有全大西洋的水生生物解剖论文——但你越查下去，发现的资料就越奇怪。\n"
"你小心翼翼朝著道森那一边摸索过去，发现他的桌子上摊著一张地图，上面堆满了书籍、信封和文件。你决定冒险看一眼，希望道森忙于他事务，在外面再待一会儿。你将挡路的东西推开，仔细检查地图。这是一幅广袤的全世界海图，上面标出的点墨迹犹新。旁边就放著一支钢笔。\n"
"不得不说，道森做的标记都很奇怪。海洋上画出的记号超过一打。有些就靠近大陆，还有些在大洋中央。具体位置都以大大的空心圆标出，以示详细坐标尚且未知。每个旁边还都写著奇怪的单词。北大西洋格陵兰岛附近的是普萨维。南大西洋靠近非洲海岸的则是耶萨拉。南太平洋深处藏著拉莱耶。东印度洋里，澳洲海岸线上则是萨勒耶瓦。还有十多个，每个都标著问号——预示著记录并不完备。你将盖在北美洲上面的书轻轻推到一边，发现还有一个记号就在马萨诸塞州海岸边。伊哈·恩斯雷。\n"
"你的思绪回到了现在。你猛踩一脚刹车，车子吱嘎一声停下了。不，这不可能。你意识到了实情，心都纠作了一团。不——！\n"
"伊哈·恩斯雷并不是深潜者唯一的家园。只是众多家园之一。"
