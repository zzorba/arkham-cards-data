"Crimson-tinted fog bathes the sky as you reach the gatehouse of Falcon Point. Atop the cliffs above you, the lighthouse beacon pierces through the mist. Considering the state of Innsmouth, you wonder what purpose the signal serves now. You doubt there are any ships out at sea given the inclement weather.\n"
"Somewhere inside is the evidence you found weeks ago. You suspect that Oceiros—the man who captured you and left you in that pit to die—also resides within. \"Are you ready?\" Agent Harper asks. \"We have no real escape route here, should things go south. Be prepared for anything.\"\n"
"You nod. It's too late to turn back now. Steadily, you make your way toward the cliffs. One way or another, this ends today."

"你到达猎鹰岬门房的时候，天上弥漫著深红色的浓雾。唯有头顶悬崖上的灯塔发出的亮光刺透迷雾。你想到印斯茅斯如今的情况，不禁好奇这样的讯号是为谁发出。这般恶劣的天气，你怀疑压根儿就不会有船出海。\n"
"这里面某个地方有你数周前追寻的证据。你怀疑奥赛罗思——那个抓住你，把你留在深坑中等死的男人——也住在这里。“你准备好了吗？”哈珀特工问道，“要是事情失控，这里可没有逃生之路。要做好应对一切可能的准备。”\n"

"You peer up at Falcon Point lighthouse, but from much further below. You are aboard Mr. Moore's fishing vessel, during your voyage to Devil Reef several weeks earlier. The ship sways back and forth as angry waves thrash against its hull. \"'Fraid it's gon' be a bit rocky,\" the ship captain shouts over the crashing of the tumultuous sea. \"Weather's been awful wild of late. Strange tides an' stranger winds.\"\n"
"But still you stare up at the ominous lighthouse, its beacon a guiding light, a warning sign, or both. Curious what knowledge he might have, you ask Mr. Moore about the lighthouse. \"That ol' thing? Been there longer'n Innsmouth itself. Marsh family's kept it runnin' as long as I remember. Oceiros is keeper now. Strange fella, that Oceiros. They say the only place in town he visits is the Order o' Dagon hall by New Church Green.\" He shakes his head.\n"
"You wonder if there are more secrets inside the lighthouse than meets the eye. Mr. Moore seems to note your curiosity. \"I've heard them Marshes've carved out caverns beneath the lighthouse goin' all the way down to sea level an' beyond,\" he claims. \"Dunno if that's true, but sometimes when I'm out at sea I've seen groups of 'em up by the cliffside, all wavin' an kneelin' like they're prayin' or something. Never really paid it much mind, but…\" his voice grows quieter. \"Jus' thought you oughta know.\"\n"
"You nod and thank him. If what he's saying is true, perhaps you should give this lighthouse a visit. You make a mental note to research more about Falcon Point once you return to town.\n"
"When your mind snaps back to the present, you recall the legwork you'd done after your expedition to Devil Reef, and the information you found on the vast network of tunnels beneath the lighthouse…"

"你向上凝视著猎鹰岬的灯塔，但视线所处位置远低于悬崖。此刻恰是几周前，你在摩尔船长的船上，正在前往魔鬼礁石的路上。怒涛猛击船身，船只前后摇摆。“怕不只是有点儿晃了。”船长的叫声盖过了喧闹的海浪撞击的声音，“近来这天气真是见了鬼。怪风怪浪的。”\n"
"但你依然抬头望著如谶的灯塔，它发出的是指引，是警告，抑或都是？你好奇摩尔船长会不会知道什么，于是问他灯塔的事。“那东西？比印斯茅斯都老。咱记得以来，那儿就是马什家在管。现在的看门人是奥赛罗思。怪家伙，那个奥赛罗思。大伙说他在村子里就只去新格林教会的达贡密教大厅。”他摇了摇头。\n"
"你想知道灯塔里是否有比目见所及更多的秘密。摩尔船长似乎注意到了你的好奇。“咱听说灯塔下面马什一家挖出洞来了，一直通到海平面以下去。”他说道，“不知道真假，但咱有时候出海，能看见他们一群人在悬崖边上，挥著手，跪著，像在祈祷还是干啥。我倒是没咋注意过，但……”他的声音矮了下去，“就是觉得你该知道。”\n"
"你点头道谢。要是他所言非虚，或许你应该造访灯塔一回。你心中暗暗记下，等回到镇子之后，要再多探查猎鹰岬一番。\n"

He's found his own little corner of the pub in which to hide and drown himself in alcohol. So much the better—you'd prefer to keep your investigation quiet.\n"
"You jot down notes as the drunken man rambles on about the creatures he's seen swimming off the coast and prowling around the reefs. \"Deep Ones,\" he names them. \"Caught one in my net once,\" he blabbers through slurred speach. \"She an' her eggs—tha's right!—'er eggs, bigger'n your fist, an' squirmin' an' wrigglin', too!\"\n"
"Absorbed in the ritual of telling a tale for his fellow sailors, he elaborates: \"She had one of 'em in her arms. Tiny little devil, with bulgin', hateful eyes. Couldn't stand the sight of it. I threw the net o'er as soon as I realized what I'd caught, an' came right back 'ere. If I had my way I'd never sail 'gain.\"\n"

But then, what is the purpose of the uncanny hybrid creatures you have seen skulking about the town? Are they but figments of your frightened imagination?
