"You bounce through your memories, struggling to return to the present. You remember a dark cell. A knife at your throat. A man with wide, unblinking eyes, wearing a long hooded robe. \"Oceiros,\" another voice calls, \"these ones were found in Dagon's lair as well. We believe they were the ones snooping around Devil Reef.\"\n"
"Oceiros nods. The knife at your throat digs deeper. \"Take what they have stolen to the lighthouse at once,\" he commands. \"It is time to begin our great work. None will disrupt the Order's business ever again.\"\n"
"Your mind snaps back to the present. The rumbling of an automobile engine grows as your senses return. Agent Harper grips your shoulder and peers into your eyes. \"Another vision,\" she utters with a hint of surprise. \"Do you remember something? What was it?\"\n"
"You shake the ache from your pounding skull and ask Harper if the name Oceiros means anything. \"Oceiros Marsh? He's the keeper of the old lighthouse on Falcon Point,\" she replies. \"Why? What did you see?\""

"你的意识在回忆中四处游荡，挣扎著想要回到现实。你记起了黑色的牢房。抵在你脖颈的尖刀。一个巨眼肿胀的男子，袍子上有长长的兜帽。“奥赛罗思。”另一个声音叫道，“这家伙也是在达贡巢穴里拉到的。我们觉得在魔鬼礁石刺探的就是这帮家伙了。”\n"
"奥赛罗思点了点头。抵在你喉咙的刀刺得更深了。“马上把他们偷的东西带到灯塔去。”他命令道，“是时候开始我们的大业了。没有人能阻止密教了。”\n"
"你的思绪回到了现实。你重获知觉，汽车的引擎声也越来越大。哈珀特工抓著你的肩膀，盯著你的眼睛。“又是幻象。”她的语气里带一丝惊讶，“你记起什么了吗？是什么？”\n"
"你摇摇头，把痛感从砰砰作响的脑子里赶走。你问哈珀特工，“奥赛罗思”是否意味著什么。“奥赛罗思·马什？他是猎鹰岬上老灯塔的看门人。”她回道，“怎么？你看到什么了？”"

msgid "You describe the idol found in the undersea grotto. Agent Harper nods along with you. \"I remember seeing something like that in some of the notes I found while you were off investigating the reef. It depicts some kind of ancient deity—something those vile creatures worship.\" Her voice lowers to little more than a whisper. \"Something I suspect is no myth.\" You ask where the idol is now, and she shakes her head. \"I suspect it was taken from you when you were thrown into that pit,\" she replies."
msgstr "你描述自己在海下岩洞发现的偶像。哈珀特工点头应和。“我记得你在调查礁石的时候，我在找到的笔记里见过与之类似的东西。它描绘的是某种古代神灵——正是那些邪恶生物崇拜的东西。”她的声音低了下去，只比耳语略高，“那东西我怀疑并不是神话。”你问她偶像现在在哪儿，她却只是摇了摇头。“我怀疑是你被扔到坑里的时候，被人拿走了。”她回道。"

msgid "You recall the strange mantle you found submerged in the depths of Devil Reef. \"Yes, I remember seeing that,\" Harper says with a snap of her fingers. \"One of the 'priests' in that accursed Esoteric Order of Dagon wore it when I first arrived in Innsmouth. It must have been taken to the lighthouse with the rest of your belongings when you were captured at the Order's headquarters. If we're lucky, it'll still be there…\""
msgstr "你回忆自己在魔鬼礁石水下深处发现的奇怪斗篷。“哦，我记得见过那个。”哈珀打了个响指说道，“我第一次到印斯茅斯的时候，那个该死的‘达贡密教’里有个‘祭司’就穿著这个。你在密教总部被抓住的时候，斗篷肯定和你的其他东西一起被带到灯塔去了。要是我们幸运的话，它还会在那儿……”"

msgid "You tell Agent Harper about the temple with the two statues you discovered within Devil Reef, and about the crown you stole. \"That sounds like the 'Headdress of Y'ha-nthlei' I read about while I was researching the Order. I'm impressed you were able to make off with it. Whatever it is, it sounds pretty important to the Order. Although I still have no clue what 'Y'ha-nthlei' is.\" You remark that you don't have the crown anymore, and she nods. \"It must have been taken from you and brought to the lighthouse with the rest of your things before you lost your memories,\" she explains."
msgstr "你告诉了哈珀特工你在魔鬼礁石发现的神庙，里面的两尊雕像，还有你偷走的头冠。“听起来像是‘伊哈·恩斯雷的头冠’，我以前在研究密教时读到过。你能带著它溜出来，我真是佩服。无论这到底是什么东西，肯定都对密教很重要。尽管我并没找到线索证明‘伊哈·恩斯雷’究竟是什么。”你说头冠现在并不在你手上，她点了点头。“肯定是在你失忆之前，头冠就和你的其他东西一起被带到灯塔去了。”她解释道。"

msgid "You struggle to remember anything of value beyond your initial exploration of the reef. You recall the uncanny creatures you fought, the various islands you explored, and the rising tides, but no more. Secrets must be hidden in those reefs, but either you were unable to find them, or you simply don't recall. Your head throbs with pain as you struggle to summon memories from the void within your mind. \"That's okay,\" Agent Harper says, placing a hand on your shoulder. \"We'll figure this out together.\""
msgstr "你极力回忆自己一开始探索礁石到底有没有发现什么有价值的东西。你回忆起自己战斗过的可怕怪物、探索过的无数岛礁，还有不断上涨的潮水。除此之外，再无其他。肯定还有秘密潜藏在礁石之下，但你没能发现，又或者只是没能记起。你极力从脑海空白之处呼唤记忆，但回应你的只有一阵刺痛。“不妨事的。”哈珀特工将手放在你的肩上，“我们会一起找出来的。”"

"\"It seems your memories are starting to return,\" Agent Harper says with a tentative grin. \"How do you feel?\"\n"
"You struggle to find a reply that fits. Part of you is relieved to have your memories returning, but the rest of you wishes they hadn't been so vivid. You wonder once more if you should simply take this opportunity to drive back to Arkham and never set foot in Innsmouth again. Then your gaze meets Harper's, and you see that fierce resolve within her eyes. The same resolve that stirs in you.\n"
"You say nothing, but she seems to understand. \"This must be a lot to take in. For now, let's focus on getting to Falcon Point. If what you say is true, and Oceiros is part of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, there should be answers there.\" She looks over her shoulder, peering into the western horizon. The sun dips just below the treeline, bathing the sky in deep scarlet. \"Something tells me this isn't over.\""

"“看起来你的记忆开始回来了。”哈珀特工露出一个试探的笑容，“感觉怎么样？”\n"
"你绞尽脑汁想找到合适的回答。能取回记忆，你是松了口气。但你也想拜托这些记忆能不能别这么生动。你又一次在想，自己是不是应该抓住这个机会，开车回阿卡姆去，从此不要再来印斯茅斯。你随即和哈珀对上了眼神，看到了她眼中坚定的决心。你心中也有著同样的决心。\n"
"你一语不发，但她看上去已然了解。“要弄明白这些肯定不容易。现在，让我们盯准猎鹰岬。要是你所言非虚，而奥赛罗思·马什是达贡密教的一员，那儿就该有问题的答案。”她回头看了一眼西方的地平线。日已西垂，低沉到树冠之下，把天空映得一片深红。“我总觉得事情还没结束。”"

msgid "Return Thomas Dawson to the collection. If an investigator earned Elina Harper (at any point during this campaign), they may add her back to their deck."
