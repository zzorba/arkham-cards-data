"Your eyes flutter open with the languor of one who has slept for days on end. Your senses are in no hurry to return. You blink and struggle to see through the inky black surrounding you. Every inch of you aches with dull, throbbing pain. Your skin is cold and numb, and your clothes are waterlogged. Your mind swims with half-articulated thoughts and tangled memories. You have no idea where you are or how you got here.\n"
"You snap to attention, heart racing in your chest. You lie on a jagged stone floor in a shallow pool of dark, ice-cold water. Knowing panic will only make the situation worse, you take a series of deep, meditative breaths. you try to remember something—anything—that might allow you to retrace your steps, but your mind is blank. You remember who you are, but nothing whatsoever from the recent past. You steady yourself and examine your surroundings.\n"
"The chamber appears to be a natural cave formation. Kelp dangles from the ceiling. The stone walls and floor are wet and slimy. A rhythmic drip, drip, drip echoes throughout the otherwise silent cave. This cavern has been underwater, and not too long ago. A result of the tides, perhaps? You swallow your fear like a lump of cold iron. If it is low tide now… A cold shudder ripples up your spine. You examine the ceiling and are surprised to see a slab of metal set into the rough stone overhead. Its polished surface is alien to the rest of the natural cavern. You call out for help, hoping somebody can hear.\n"
"Your dread deepens at the reply: an awful croaking and gurgling that permeates the tunnels—a sound no human could make."

"你挣扎著睁开双眼，疲惫得彷佛已经沉睡数日。你的知觉还未完全恢复。你眨眨眼，拼命想看清身边的一团墨黑。你身上每一寸都传来阵阵钝痛。你的皮肤冰冷麻木，衣服湿湿漉漉。你的脑海里回荡著四分五裂的思绪和支离破碎的记忆。你不知道自己是谁，也不明白自己为何会在这儿。\n"
"你猛地回过神来，胸膛里心脏狂跳。你躺在参差的石地上，周围是浅浅一滩冰冷的黑水。你知道惊慌失措只会让情况更糟，深呼吸了一阵，集中精神。你试著想起什么——任何东西——任何能让你回溯的东西，但你的脑海一片空白。你记起了自己是谁，但最近的事情你却怎么都想不起来。你稳住心神，查看周围。\n"
"这个空间看起来像是自然形成的洞穴。顶上垂下了水藻。石壁和地面潮湿黏滑。万籁俱寂，唯有水滴的回响还颇有些节奏。整座洞穴在不久之前都曾在水下。也许是潮汐的结果？你咽下自己的恐惧，彷佛生吞一块寒铁。如果现在恰是退潮之时……想到这里，一阵寒颤穿透脊背。你仔细查看天顶，却惊讶地发现头上粗糙的石板里嵌著金属板。那光滑的表面和天然形成的洞窟格格不入。你呼喊求救，希望有人能听到。\n"
"但得到的回应只让你更为恐惧——隧道间穿过一汨咕呱之声——能发出这声音的绝非人类。"

(For example, in this scenario, both the <i>Flooded Caverns</i> encounter set and <i>The Pit of Despair</i> encounter set contain unrevealed Tidal Tunnel locations).

"You stand in a small office, examining a worn photograph in a well-polished wooden frame. In the photo, a squad of men in military uniforms pose in front of a Bristol F.2 Fighter plane. Several of the men wear tan British uniforms, but one sports the olive overcoat and khakis of an American soldier. His sleeves each bear a rectangular patch striped vertically with a captain's paired silver bars. At the bottom of the photograph, in black ink, cursive handwriting reads \"British Fourth Army, outside St. Quentin, 1918.\"\n"
"The door to the office opens suddenly, startling you. You put the photograph down and turn to address the man entering. You identify him immediately by his dark-brown skin, his strong jaw, and his broad shoulders. It is Thomas Dawson—the American from the photograph—though he has aged a bit since his war days, and heavy bags hang under his eyes. \"One war ends; a new one begins,\" he says quietly. \"Only this enemy is even harder to root out.\"\n"
"You ask the man what a war hero is doing in the investigative business, and he chuckles softly in response. \"War hero? I don't know where you heard that from. I was just doing my duty.\" You shake your head but do not argue further. You suspect that the squadron Captain Dawson rescued would disagree as well.\n"
"\"In any event, I suppose you're wondering why I summoned you here to Boston,\" he says, gesturing for you to take a seat in front of his desk. You sit and respond to his remark with affirmation, wondering aloud why a telephone call would not have sufficed. \"This is a… sensitive matter,\" he replies. \"A few days ago, I lost contact with one of my agents, a Miss Elina Harper. I had her investigating several strange reports I've received in the past few months, all concerning a town called Innsmouth. Do you know the place? It's along the coast to the north of your town of Arkham, just by Ipswich.\"\n"
"You know the place. Though most have never heard of the shadowed, decrepit seaport, those who do hear only ill rumors. From what you understand, the town used to be lively port before the War of 1812, but it has since become dingy and run-down. The only railway line that runs through Innsmouth is abandoned, and there are no references to the town on any maps or in any guidebooks you have ever seen.\n"
"\"Perhaps she's found something curious or has gone into hiding, but I suspect foul play. It could be mob work, but I doubt it. I'm not sending any more agents until I know for sure. However, I have some room in our discretionary budget to hire a third party, such as yourself.\" You assume Agent Dawson is dancing around the truth, which is that you are expendable. \"I know it isn't much to go on, but I need to know the status of Agent Harper. Even bad news would be better than no news, at this point. If you do me this favor, our agency will be in your debt.\" You ask which agency Dawson is referring to. A smirk tugs at his lips.\n"
"When you snap back to the present, you still gaze at Agent Dawson's face, only his smirk is twisted in a haunting visage of agony. It is just one of the many faces that writhe in torment throughout this repulsive creature's scaly, pulsating flesh."

"你站在一间小小的办公室里，打量著精致木框里的老照片。照片上是一队穿著军服的男子，正站在一架布里斯托F.2战斗机前摆著拍照的姿势。其中几个穿著棕色的英国军服，而有一个得意地穿著橄榄色的外套和美军的卡其布军服。他两边的肩章上都是上尉的一对银杠。照片底部用黑色墨水潦草地写著“英国第四集团军，圣康坦市外，1918年。”\n"
"房间的门突然打开，吓了你一跳。你放下照片，转过来朝著进门的男子。他古铜色的皮肤，坚实的下巴和宽厚的肩膀，让你一下子就认出来了。这就是托马斯·道森——照片上的美国人。只不过他看起来比战时苍老了一些，眼睛下面也挂上了沉重的眼袋。“旧的战争结束了，新的战争又已开始。”他轻轻说著，“但这一次的敌人更难根除。”\n"
"你问他大战的英雄如今怎么干起了调查行当，而他只是轻轻一笑以作回应。“大战的英雄？我可不知道你这是从哪儿听来的。我只是在尽自己的职责。”你摇摇头，并未争辩。只是你觉得道森上尉救下的飞行中队可不会同意他的说法。\n"
"“无论如何，我想你正好奇为什么我得把你叫到波士顿来。”他说著示意你在桌前落座。你乖乖坐下，并坦言确实如此，提问有什么事不能在电话里说。“这……可还挺敏感。”他答道，“几天前，我和自己的特工艾莲娜·哈珀女士失去了联系。我派她去调查过去几个月里收到的奇怪报告，这些报告都提到一个名叫印斯茅斯的村子。你知道这地方吗？从你们阿卡姆镇沿著海岸往北，就靠著伊普斯威奇。”\n"
"你倒确实知道这地方。尽管大多数人都从未听说这个阴暗衰败的海港，知道的寥寥几人听到的也都是不祥的流言。你印象中的印斯茅斯，在1812年战争之前还是一座生机勃勃的港口，但打那以后，就开始萧条昏暗。唯一穿过印斯茅斯的铁路已经废弃，你能找到的地图和导览手册上都找不见它的身影。\n"
"“兴许她是找到了什么不寻常的事情，又或者藏了起来。但我怀疑情况可能不妙。兴许是惹上了黑帮，但这也不太可能。在确定情况之前，我不会再派别的特工。不过，我的预算里还有点活动空间，可以雇佣第三方——比如，你。”你觉得道森特工并没有跟你掏心窝子。说白了，就是你出事也没什么大不了。“现在的情况的确还不明朗，但我得知道哈珀特工的情况。现在坏消息也好过没消息。要是你帮我这个忙，‘组织’就算欠你的。”你问道森“组织”指的是什么。但他只咧嘴一个坏笑。\n"
"你猛地回到现实，眼前依然是道森特工那张脸，只是坏笑的表情已扭曲成徘徊不去的痛苦。这张脸和众多面庞一起，在这可怕怪物长鳞鼓动的血肉上痛苦翻滚。"

"You reply that you have seen nothing quite like it before, but it does happen to match the descriptions you have heard of the \"devils\" that skulk about the reefs a couples of miles beyond the harbour. \"Something fishy is going on here, if you'll pardon my saying,\" the man mutters, folding his arms across his chest. \"I'm glad I roped you in on this case. It's looking less and less like mob work with each passing hour.\" You nod in agreement and hand the strange figurine back to the agent.

Its large, round eyes glare at you. In the distance, you hear the faint chanting of some kind of ceremony. \"Y'ha-nthlei! Y'ha-nthlei!\" the voices cry. Just as you begin to make out the strange syllables, a splash behind you catches your attention. You duck behind the onyx statue and wait patiently as several figures approach where you stood just moments before. You hold your breath.
