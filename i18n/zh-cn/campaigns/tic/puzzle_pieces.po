"You have no idea who this woman is or how she knows you, yet she seems comfortable and familiar with you. You strain your memory trying to think of how you might have met, but it's no use. You're certain she is a complete stranger. Having woken up in a cold, wet prison with no memories, you aren't feeling very sociable. Your fear and distrust must show, because the woman backs off and narrows her eyes. \"What is it? What's wrong?\"\n"
"You respond by asking the woman if you know her. \"You truly don't remember? Well, that's going to complicate things. What do you recall? Do you remember anything?\"\n"
"You relate to the woman the flashes of recollection that you experienced earlier…"

"尽管这女人看起来十分放松，和你很是熟悉，但你还是一点儿也不认识她，更不知道她是怎么认识你的。你绞尽脑汁，想要回忆你在哪见过她，但毫无头绪。你确定她完全是个陌生人。说实话，你刚从冰冷潮湿的牢笼中醒来，脑子里一片空白，并不是很想说话。你脸上一定露出了惊吓和怀疑的表情，因为这女子退了一步，皱起了眉头。“咋了？出啥事了？”\n"
"你转而问她，自己是不是认识她。“你真的啥也不记得了？好吧，这下可麻烦了。你还能记起啥？有啥事是你还能想起来的不？”\n"
"你把自己先前体验的闪回记忆告诉了这个女人……"

"You put two and two together and ask if the woman is Miss Harper. \"Ah, so you do remember me?\" she asks with a playful smirk, but you shake your head in response and explain that you only remember being hired by a man named Thomas Dawson to find her. \"But that was… oh. You have forgotten a lot, haven't you? Speaking of Dawson, where is he? Did you see him down there?\"\n"
"Your thoughts turn to the twisted, mangled face that triggered your flashback. Agent Harper's expression turns dour as she watches your eyes. \"…I see. I wish he hadn't come to this forsaken town. Those brutes are going to pay for this.\" You ask who she thinks is responsible for Dawson's death, and she raises her eyebrows in response. \"Right, you don't remember. As far as I know, the last time anybody saw either of you was just before you visited the Esoteric Order of Dagon. Draw your own conclusions.\""

"你回溯记忆，进行猜测，询问女子她是否就是哈珀女士。“啊，所以你还是记得我的？”她戏谑地笑著问道。但你摇了摇头，解释说自己只记得有个叫托马斯·道森的人雇你来找她。“但这……哦。你忘掉的东西可真不少？说到道森，他在哪儿？你在下面见著他了？”\n"
"你想到了那张扭曲损毁的脸，正是它唤醒了你的记忆。看到你的眼神，哈珀特工瞬间失色：“……我明白了。要是他没来这个被遗弃的村庄就好了。那帮恶人会付出代价的。”你问她觉得谁该为道森之死负责，而她抬了抬眉毛以作回应。“喔对，你都不记得了。据我所知，最后一次有人看到你俩，是在达贡密教门前。你自己想吧。”"

msgid "You shake your head. You remember nothing. \"That's going to make this difficult,\" the woman says with a sigh. \"All right. Well, I'll tell you what I know. I am Agent Elina Harper. My understanding is that you were hired by my boss, Agent Thomas Dawson, thanks to your deeper understanding of… well, of things that don't really make sense to the rest of us.\" You ask what task you were hired to perform, and the woman smirks. \"You were hired to find me, actually. The Order wasn't too happy about that. It's a bit of a long story. Let's get out of here first, and then I can catch you up on all of that.\""
msgstr "你摇摇头。你什么也不记得。“这下事情可麻烦了。”这女人叹了口气，“好吧。我来说说我知道的。我是艾莲娜·哈珀特工。在我看来，雇你的是我的老板，托马斯·道森特工，因为你深刻地了解……好吧，了解对咱而言没啥道理的事情。”你问她是否知道自己被雇来干什么的，但这女人笑了。“其实你是被雇来找我的。但密教对此可不乐意。说来话长。让我们先离开这儿，我再一五一十地都告诉你。”"

Let's hope we don't have to head back that way anytime soon… and let's hope that <i>thing</i> stays dead.\""
msgstr "你把自己和某种水生生物的大战告诉了哈珀特工。“魔鬼礁石。”她打了个寒颤，“无论村子里发生了啥事，源头都能找到魔鬼礁石那儿去。但愿咱不用再走回头路过去……但愿那东西真的死了。"

msgid "\"So you and Dawson were looking for me together, then? Interesting.\" She considers this for a moment. \"I guess even the extraordinary Captain Dawson can be rattled from time to time. It's somewhat gratifying to know he cared that much about finding me. Still…\" her gaze wanders towards the horizon. \"All right, Dawson. I'll make sure you didn't die in vain. I'll burn this whole town to the ground if I have to.\""
msgstr "“所以你是和道森一起找我，嗯？有意思。”她想了一会儿，“我猜就算是杰出的道森上尉，有时候也会手忙脚乱。知道他把找我放在心上，还是挺痛快的。只是……”她远眺地平线，“好的，道森。我发誓不会让你白死。就算要把这村子烧成灰，我也一定办到。”"

msgid "If <i>an encounter with a secret cult</i> is listed under \"Memories Recovered\":"

msgid "You describe your memory from inside some kind of cult headquarters. \"Sounds like that must have taken place inside the Esoteric Order of Dagon building on the north side of town,\" Agent Harper reasons. \"That organization is vile: I just know it. I have no evidence to bring back, though, and it sounds like you've forgotten everything you learned.\" She curses under her breath."
msgstr "你把自己在邪教总部的遭遇描述了一番。“听起来定是在村子北边的达贡密教。”哈珀特工推理道，“那组织邪恶得很：这我能肯定。但我没能把证据带回来。听上去你也把自己知道的事情全忘了。”她喘息之间全是咒骂。"

"You point to the strange, crimson horizon behind Agent Harper and note aloud the alignment of the sun and the moon. \"That began just after you and Agent Dawson entered the Order's headquarters,\" she explains. \"That was almost three days ago. I have no idea what it means, but I can't imagine it is anything good. All of Innsmouth's been locked tight lately. Not a soul in sight. You're lucky I figured out where to look for you.\"\n"
"Your mind reels. The last thing you remember before waking up in that dank pit was enjoying a pleasant late-summer's eve in Arkham. Now you're in another town altogether, and your memory is filled with gaping holes. You wonder aloud what the date is, and Agent Harper replies: \"It's the twenty-fourth of September. I don't know when exactly you arrived in Innsmouth or how much of your memory is missing. Isn't there anything else you remember? Anything at all?\"\n"
"The water sloshes against your feet as you struggle to remember. In minutes, the tide has risen several inches, and there's no sign of it slowing down. You fix your gaze on the woman who stands before you—her weary eyes, her disheveled clothes, the red marks on her wrists—and something triggers in your recollection.\n"
"\"Wake up. We're almost there.\" The memory lurks at the precipice of your consciousness, threatening to draw you into the darkness. \"Hey. Wake up, I said.\" You clutch your forehead as searing pain bounces throughout your skull. \"Wake up, dammit!\"\n"
"Darkness pulls at the edges of your vision. More memories come flooding back…"

"你指向哈珀特工身后诡异的深红色天际线，提醒她日月如今已成一线。“你和道森特工一进密教总部，就变成了这样。”她解释道，“大概有三天了。我不知道这意味著啥，但怎么想都不会是好事。最近整个印斯茅斯都封锁了。一个人也见不著。我可算找到了该去哪儿找你，这你可真走运。”\n"
"你惊愕不已。在身处潮湿的深坑之前，你能想起来的最后一件事，还是在阿卡姆愉快的暮夏一夜。现在你却完全在另一个村子，记忆千疮百孔。你问今天是什么日子，哈珀特工回道：“九月二十四号。我不知道你究竟是啥时候到印斯茅斯的，也不知道你的记忆究竟缺了多少。还有啥是你能想起来的吗？任何事情？”\n"
"就在你尽力回想的时候，海水冲刷著你的脚底。潮水几分钟内就上涨了几寸，并且全无减缓的迹象。你凝视著眼前站著的这个女人——她疲惫的双眼、凌乱的衣服、手腕上的红印子——触发了你的某段回忆。\n"
"“醒醒。我们就要到了。”回忆潜伏在你意识的边缘，要将你拖入黑暗。“嘿。醒醒，我说。”你紧按额头，脑子里一阵灼痛。“醒醒！他妈的！”\n"
"你眼前一片漆黑。更多的回忆涌了回来……"
