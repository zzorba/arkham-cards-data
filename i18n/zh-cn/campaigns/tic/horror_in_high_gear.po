"Trees whizz by as you rumble along the old dirt road just outside of Innsmouth. The sun has set over the western horizon, leaving only the full moon to bathe the dusty roads in its brilliant, eerie glow.\n"
"\"Here,\" Agent Harper shouts from the passenger seat over the rumbling of the automobile engine. She points to a spot on the map she has spread across her lap, tapping it repeatedly. \"Falcon Point Lighthouse. That's where Oceiros should be.\"\n"
"A shudder courses up your spine. If your memories are to be believed, Oceiros is the man who left you to die in those tidal tunnels. You ask Harper how far Falcon Point is from Innsmouth, hoping to arrive before the Order realizes you've escaped.\n"
"She sighs. \"It's not that far, but these roads are meandering. They could be difficult to navigate. One wrong turn and—\" both you and Harper see the lights in your rearview mirror at the same time. Headlights. And they're growing larger and brighter by the second. Harper curses under her breath. \"I don't suppose those are friends of yours?\"\n"
"You shake your head and tighten your grip on the wheel. It seems the Order has already caught wind of your flight from Innsmouth. You tell Agent Harper to hold on and slam your foot on the accelerator."

"你在印斯茅斯郊外的旧土路上隆隆前行，树木在一旁飕飕作响。太阳已降到西方的地平线上，唯有满月还将诡异的明光洒在土路上。\n"
"“这儿。”哈珀特工在座位上叫了起来，声音盖过了引擎的轰响。她摊开了地图，不断敲击上面的一点。“猎鹰岬的灯塔。奥赛罗思就在那儿。”\n"
"你脊背一阵打颤。要是你所记不错，奥赛罗思就是把你扔在潮水通道里等死的男人。你问哈珀猎鹰岬离印斯茅斯有多远，想赶在密教发现你逃跑之前就赶到。\n"
"她叹了口气：“路倒是不远，但绕得要命。找准方向可不容易。拐错一个弯，那就——”你和哈珀同时看到了后视镜上闪过的光点。是车灯。每一秒都越来越强，越来越亮。哈珀喘息之间骂了一句。“我想这些人总不能是你朋友？”\n"
"你摇摇头，握紧了方向盘。看来密教已经得知风声，明白你逃出了印斯茅斯。你告诉哈珀抓紧，狠狠踩下了油门。"

"During this scenario, the investigators are traveling the Old Innsmouth Road from Innsmouth to Falcon Point. This road is generally a straight line from left to right, but occasionally contains branching paths.\n"
"Each time a location with the Road X keyword is revealed, if there are no locations ahead of the just revealed location, put X new locations into play in a new column in front of it, Old Innsmouth Road side faceup.

Each of the remaining locations to be put into play are taken from among the set-aside Long Way Around locations <i>(if there are not enough Long Way Around locations, use as many as you can)</i>.

"本场冒险中，调查员要沿著印斯茅斯老路前往猎鹰岬。这条路总的来说是从左到右的一条直线，但有时也会有岔路。\n"
"每当揭示了有道路X关键词的地点，如果刚刚揭示的地点前方没有地点，则将X个新地点放置入场，排成一列放在前面，以印斯茅斯老路面朝上。这些地点中的第一张必须从道路牌堆顶拿取。其余要放置入场的地点则从放在一边的蜿蜒长路中拿取<i>(如果没有足够的蜿蜒长路地点，则尽可能拿取)</i>。混洗这些地点，以使玩家无法分辨。"

msgid "<i>For example: Trish is the driver of Elina Harper's Car, and has just moved that car forward to an unrevealed location. It is a Fork in the Road with the \"Road 2\" keyword. Since there are currently no locations in front of Fork in the Road, she must therefore place 2 Old Innsmouth Road locations in front of Fork in the Road. She takes the top card of the Road deck and one of the set-aside Long Way Around locations, puts both of them into play in a new column in front of Fork in the Road, and shuffles them so that the players do not know which is which.</i>"
msgstr "<i>示例：特里希是艾莲娜·哈珀的车的司机，刚刚将该车向前移动到一个未揭示地点。这个地点是歧路，带有“道路2”关键词。由于歧路前方现在已没有地点，所以她必须将2张印斯茅斯老路地点放在歧路前方。她拿取道路牌堆顶的卡牌，和一张放在一边的蜿蜒长路地点，将这两张卡牌放置入场，在歧路前方排成一列，并混洗以使玩家无法分辨。</i>"

msgid "Generally, it is wise to avoid taking a Long Way Around, since it will slow you down and reduce the amount of time you have to reach Falcon Point."
msgstr "总的来说，避免拿取蜿蜒长路才是明智之举，因为它会减缓你的速度，浪费你前往猎鹰岬的时间。"

msgid "Your drive to Falcon Point is no joyride. Between the cultists on your tail and the creatures that dwell in the woods outside Innsmouth, your vehicle is harried at every turn. With no way to escape unharmed, you are forced to abandon your vehicle and sneak through the woods on foot. By the time you see the distant lighthouse beacon, dawn already bathes the sky in orange radiance. \"Finally,\" Agent Harper groans. With no time to rest, you continue the trek to the Falcon Point lighthouse, exhausted but resolute."
msgstr "你前往猎鹰岬的路上可不轻松。异教徒跟在后面紧追不舍，还有印斯茅斯村外树林里潜居的怪物，你的车子每个转弯都备受阻挠。它一路逃出，已是伤痕累累，你不得不丢下车子，在树林里用两条腿隐秘前行。等你能远远瞧见灯塔的时候，晨曦已将天空映得一片橙红。“终于到了。”哈珀特工呻吟道。但已没有时间可以浪费，你继续向猎鹰岬的灯塔跋涉。精疲力尽，破釜沉舟。"

msgid "You breathe a sigh of relief as you see the distant lighthouse beacon pierce the fog. \"Let's pull over here and make the rest of the trip on foot,\" Harper suggests. \"If there's anybody still in that lighthouse, it would be best if they didn't hear us approach.\" Her advice is sound. You're not sure what to expect once you reach Falcon Point, but all signs point to it being another outpost for the Order. You double-check to make sure you aren't being followed, then pull over by the side of the road. Gathering your belongings from the car's trunk, you begin the trek to the Falcon Point lighthouse…"
msgstr "你穿越浓雾，终于瞧见了远远的灯塔，不禁松了口气。“咱们把车停在这儿，剩下的路用走的吧。”哈珀建议道，“要是还有人在灯塔里，最好不要让他听见我们来了。”她的建议十分稳妥。你可不敢确定在猎鹰岬会遇上什么，但所有的迹象都表明这里是密教的另一处据点。你再三确认自己未遭跟踪，然后把车停在路边。你从车箱里收齐自己的东西，开始往猎鹰岬的灯塔跋涉……"
