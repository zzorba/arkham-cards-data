"The rumbling of the boat's engine startles you from your thoughts. \"Yeh all right there?\" the ship's captain growls. \"Yeh look like ye've seen a ghost. Pale as a sheet, yeh are.\"\n"
"You turn and face the grizzled old man. Mr. Moore was the only ship captain you could find in Innsmouth who was unafflicted by whatever curse or deformity has gripped most of the town. His apparent humanity, however, has done nothing to spare his broken teeth, crooked jaw, or the massive scar torn down his right cheek. Still, he is a welcome sight, considering the way the rest of your investigation has gone.\n"
"\"Can't believe you want to head to that accurs'd Devil Reef,\" he exclaims, shaking his head. \"It's a fool's errand.\"\n"
"You point out that the sailor was happy enough to provide passage after you showed him his payment, earning a raspy chuckle out of him.\n"
"\"Yeh got me there,\" he admits. \"Now get ready. We set off in ten.\" He stumbles from the main deck into the bridge to chart a course while you prepare for the journey ahead."

"船只的引擎声将你叫醒。“都还好吗？”船长吼道，“你看上去跟鬼一样的。脸白的跟纸一样的，你啊。”\n"
"你转过来朝著头发花白的老人。你在印斯茅斯只能找到摩尔船长还肯载你了。无论是诅咒还是异形，都已攫住了大部分村子。但摩尔却不为所动。他显然还是个人类——尽管他牙齿缺损，下巴扭曲，右边脸上还撕开一道大疤。但想到你这一路的调查都看到了什么，能见著他还是令人舒心。\n"
"“真没法子信你要去那倒霉催的魔鬼礁石。”他摇著头大声喊道，“呆子才这么做。”\n"
"你向船长指出，自己给钱之后，他可开心载你一程了。这惹得他发出一阵刺耳的怪笑。\n"
"“你倒是讲到点了。”他承认道，“现在做好准备。我们十分钟后出发。”他从主甲板上踉踉跄跄地爬上舰桥，测定航行，而你则在准备前方的征程。"

"Agent Dawson boards the ship at last. He sports a heavy overcoat and carries a shotgun slugged over his shoulder. \"Agent Harper had a cache with some extra firepower,\" he explains. \"I figured, given the rumors, it couldn't hurt.\"\n"
"You know what rumors Dawson refers to: Devil Reef is supposedly haunted, or perhaps infested, with some manner of devilish sea creature. The sailors of Innsmouth speak of silhouettes crawling in and out of caves along the reef's many islands, of strangely misshapen fins sighted along the surface of the sea, and of entire boats crashing against the jagged rocks and vanishing beneath the waves.\n"
"\"All of our research has led to this. Whatever is going on in this town, the Esoteric Order of Dagon and this 'Devil Reef' are at the heart of it. Agent Harper suspects these rumors were spread by the Order to keep sailors away from the reef. If that's true, there must be something the Order is hiding.\"\n"
"You ask where Harper is, and Dawson shoots you a hard glance. \"She has her mission. We have ours.\" You remind Dawson that you've already accomplished the mission you were hired to perform, which yields a smirk from the hardened vet. \"True. And yet here you are.\"\n"
"He has a point. You could have left right after Harper was rescued, but you stayed to assist with their investigation. Perhaps out of a sense of duty, or perhaps curiosity. Whatever it was, you're here now, and there's no going back."

"道森特工最后一个上船。他得意地穿著一件厚外套，肩膀上拖著一把霰弹枪。“哈珀特工藏了一些额外的武器。”他解释道，“考虑到那些流言，我估摸著，带上可没什么坏处。”\n"
"你知道道森特工说的“流言”指的是什么：怕是有某种邪恶的海洋生物萦绕著——或者说感染了魔鬼礁石。印斯茅斯的水手提过礁石洞穴内外匍匐的轮廓，或是在海面上见过奇形怪状的鱼鳍，要么就是整艘船都撞在犬牙交错的乱石间，消失在波涛之下。\n"
"“我们所有的研究都指向这里。无论村子里发生了什么，都指向了达贡密教和这‘魔鬼礁石’。哈珀特工怀疑密教散播这些流言，就是为了让水手远离这块礁石。要真是如此，那密教肯定在隐藏什么。”\n"
"你问哈珀特工在哪儿，而道森只回你一个冷峻的目光。“她有自己的任务。我们也有我们的。”你提醒道森特工你已经完成了自己受雇的任务，但这只把坚毅的老兵逗笑了：“确实。但你怎么还在这儿呢。”\n"
"他说到点子上了。救出哈珀特工后你就可以走的，但你还是留了下来帮助他们调查。也许是出于责任感，又或者是因为好奇心。无论如何，你都在这儿了，并且无路回头。"

"Agent Dawson boards the ship at last. Heavy bags hang under his weary eyes. \"All of our leads are cold,\" he says with resignation. \"Wherever Agent Harper is now, she's beyond our reach.\"\n"
"You attempt to console Dawson by reminding him why you've chosen to investigate Devil Reef. The rumors say it is haunted, or perhaps infested, with some manner of devilish sea creature. The sailors of Innsmouth speak of silhouettes crawling in and out of caves along the reef's many islands, of strangely misshapen fins sighted along the surface of the sea, and of entire boats crashing against the jagged rocks and vanishing beneath the waves.\n"
"\"You're right,\" Dawson admits with a sigh. \"Whatever happened to Agent Harper has something to do with the Esoteric Order of Dagon. That book that was slipped under your hotel room door is evidence enough of that. And if my hypothesis is right, the ones who have been spreading these rumors about Devil Reef are none other than the Order themselves. If that's true, there must be something they're hiding.\"\n"
"You nod and begin preparing for the mission. Agent Dawson gazes at you inquisitively the entire time. \"Why did you stay?\" he finally asks. \"You could have left Innsmouth after we failed to rescue Agent Harper, but you chose to stick around. Why?\"\n"
"Truth be told, you aren't sure. Perhaps it was a sense of duty. Perhaps it was curiosity. You shrug and tell him it doesn't matter. You're here now, and there's no going back. Your admission earns you a smile from the hardened vet.\n"
"\"Right. Let's go find what they're hiding,\" he says."

"道森特工最后一个上船。他疲惫的双眼下挂著沉重的眼袋。“我们的线索都断了。”他颓唐地说道，“无论哈珀特工现在在哪，我们都找不到了。”\n"
"你试著安慰道森特工，提醒他你们为何要来调查魔鬼礁石。流言说有某种邪恶的海洋生物萦绕著——或者说感染了魔鬼礁石。印斯茅斯的水手提过礁石洞穴内外匍匐的轮廓，或是在海面上见过奇形怪状的鱼鳍，要么就是整艘船都撞在犬牙交错的乱石间，消失在波涛之下。\n"
"“你是对的。”道森叹了口气承认道，“无论哈珀特工发生了什么，看肯定和达贡密教有关。那本滑进你房间的册子就足以证明。要是我所料不虚，散布魔鬼礁石流言的人肯定是密教的。要真是如此，那他们肯定在隐藏什么。”\n"
"你点点头，为任务做准备。道森特工一直好奇地望著你。“你为什么留下来了？”他终于问道，“营救哈珀特工失败后，你就可以离开印斯茅斯的，但你还是在这转悠。为什么？”\n"
"说实话，你自己也不确定。也许是责任感。也许是好奇心。你耸耸肩，告诉他这不重要。你都在这儿了，并且无路回头。你的磊落把坚毅的老兵逗笑了。\n"
"“嗯。让我们一起找出他们到底在隐藏什么。”他说道。"
