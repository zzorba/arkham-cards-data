"Your plan is simple. Foolish, but simple. The knowledge you've gathered leads you to conclude that the Esoteric Order of Dagon is the cause of both the rising tides and the appearance of the horrific \"Deep Ones.\" Not only that, but over the course of the last few decades, the Order has transformed the townsfolk into more of the horrific creatures, using them to infiltrate Innsmouth from within. But worst of all, the entity the cult worships-Dagon-is just one of two. His mate, Hydra, still slumbers in the depths below Innsmouth, waiting to awaken and stake her claim over an endless ocean.\n"
"These are the conclusions that have led to your plan: Travel once more to Devil Reef, descend into the city of the Deep Ones that lies hidden at the bottom of the ocean, and put a stop to the Deep Ones' plans once and for all. Agent Harper helps you prepare, loading your possessions onto the boat you managed to steal from what remained of Innsmouth's docks. \"We only have one shot at this,\" Harper says. \"I don't think I need to remind you what might happen if we fail.\" She looks pointedly at the flooded ruins of Innsmouth. \"Are you ready?\""

"你的计划非常简单。愚蠢，但是简单。你总结收集的情报，得出的结论是：无论是浪潮渐起，还是可怕的“深潜者”现世，都是因为达贡密教作祟。不仅如此，在过去的几十年间，密教还将村民变得不再像人，更像是那种可怕的生物，利用他们从内部渗透整个印斯茅斯。但最糟的是，密教崇拜的神灵——达贡，竟然还有同类。他的伴侣，海德拉，依然在印斯茅斯底下的深渊沉睡，等候苏醒之日，将无尽的海洋尽数攫于掌心。\n"
"你由此得出了自己的计划：再去一趟魔鬼礁石，深入海底潜藏的深潜者之城，一劳永逸地终结深潜者的计划。哈珀特工帮你准备，从印斯茅斯港口的残余中偷来一艘船，将所有的东西都放在了船上。“我们只有一次机会。”哈珀说道，“我想用不著说，要是我们失败了，会有什么下场。”她直截了当地望向印斯茅斯已经淹没的废墟。“你准备好了吗？”"

"You are deep below the Esoteric Order of Dagon's headquarters once more, emerging from the hall where you had disrupted the Order's ritual. You follow Agent Dawson through a series of winding, flooded corridors flanked by statues of aquatic monstrosities and malformed beasts. You ask Dawson where exactly you're headed, but he doesn't reply. Finally, you enter another chamber, similar to the last. Its walls are covered in otherworldly effigies and a depiction of ocean waves swirling below an alignment of celestial bodies. Another familiar pool dominates the cavern, inside which the dark shape of something massive slumbers. To your surprise, Agent Harper stands in front of the pool, gazing into its dark reflection. She turns with a start when she hears you approach, relaxing only once she sees who you are. \"Is it done?\" Dawson asks.\n"
"She nods. \"This one isn't waking up anytime soon.\"\n"
"\"Good. The Order is on to us. We have no time to spare. Let's get to the vault and take what we came for.\"\n"
"You reel. What exactly is going on here? Both of the agents notice your confusion at the same time. A moment of grim understanding dawns as you realize the truth of the situation. The agency didn't come here to investigate criminal activity in Innsmouth at all. They came here for something else. And the only vaults you've seen so far in these depths are the ones filled with archaic riches. The material wealth that has kept the town of Innsmouth afloat all these years-perhaps the very riches that persuaded so many townsfolk to follow the Order and forsake their own humanity.\n"
"Stifling your frustration, you ask how much of Dawson's briefing was a lie. \"Not all of it,\" he says calmly. \"Agent Harper was missing when I contacted you, that much was true. But she was sent here on a different mission. One we must complete this very moment or risk losing everything we've worked for. And you're going to help us.\"\n"
"You cross your arms in defiance. It's one thing to be kept in the dark by the two agents you've risked your life for. It's another to help them smuggle treasure on behalf of the government, especially when so much more is at stake.\n"
"\"I don't think you understand,\" Dawson replies, his voice surprisingly level. \"You are an asset of the agency and under my authority. You will do as I command.\" As the silence between you grows more and more tense, you spot Dawson's hand twitching toward his holstered weapon. Is he truly willing to go that far…?\n"
"Just then, you hear shouting down the hall. \"Shit. They're here.\" Dawson turns to Harper, his orders terse and quiet: \"Take the exit through Devil Reef. We'll head back the way we came. Meet up at the vault.\"\n"
"The next minute is a blur. Dawson and Harper split up. Despite your anger, you decide it is best to follow Agent Dawson, since you are familiar with the escape route. A torrent of footsteps and hollers follows close behind. You don't get far before you are cornered. An elderly man with wide, unblinking eyes and long robes blocks your exit. \"Take them,\" he says. The rest you recall only in flashes of horror. The interrogation. The dark, flooded pit. Dawson's fate. Harper discovering you on the beach-\n"
"-You turn on Harper, your vision adjusting back to the present. She seems to understand what you have seen. Her hand hovers dangerously near her handgun. \"Dammit,\" she says. \"I was hoping you wouldn't remember what happened the last time we were in this room…\" She draws in a shaky breath as the two of you silently judge one another. \"So, what now?\" she asks. \"I still have a job to do. Are you going to get in my way?\""

"你又一次来到了达贡密教总部的地下深处，你就是在那里的厅堂里摧毁了密教的仪式。你跟著道森特工穿越一连串蜿蜒漫长淹没的长廊，两侧都是水生异怪和变形野兽的雕像。你问道森到底要去哪里，但他没有回答。你们最后来到了另一个与前处相仿的厅室。这里墙上遍布异界样式的塑像，更有大幅的壁画，画的是星象合列之下卷起的海浪。另一个池子填满了整座洞穴，里面有什么黑黢黢的庞大巨物正在沉睡。令你惊讶的是，哈珀特工正站在池子前，凝视著其中黑色的倒影。她听到你们接近，转而一惊，但发现是你们，松了口气。“都完成了？”道森问道。\n"
"她点点头：“这家伙最近是不会醒了。”\n"
"“说得好。密教正在追我们。可没剩多少时间了。快去宝库，拿走我们该拿的东西。”\n"
"你惊住了。到底是怎么一回事？两位特工同时注意到了你的迷惑。你突然意识到了事情残酷的真相。特工来这里根本不是调查什么印斯茅斯的犯罪活动的。他们别有所图。迄今为止，你在这深处所见的宝库里都装满了古代的财富。这么多年来就是这些财富在维持印斯茅斯村的周转——也许也正是这些财富，让许多村民追随密教，遗忘了人性。\n"
"你藏起自己的沮丧，询问道森所说到底有多少是谎言。“不全是。”他冷静地说道，“我联系你的时候，哈珀特工确实失踪了，这部分是真的。但她来这儿是为了别的任务。我们现在必须完成这任务，不然就会失去一直努力的一切。你得来帮我们。”\n"
"你交叉双臂，以示反对。为了两个把你蒙在鼓里的特工冒尽生命危险是一回事。帮他们为政府走私财宝，又是另一回事——更别提现在有多么危险了。\n"
"“我觉得你还是不明白。”道森语气意外的从容，“你归组织所有，你得听我的。我让你干什么，你就得照做。”你们之间的沉默越来越紧张，你发现道森的手伸向了皮套里的武器。他真的要把事情弄成这样吗……？\n"
"就在这时，你听到从厅室上头传来的叫喊。“去他妈的。他们来了。”道森转向哈珀，悄声简短地下令：“从魔鬼礁石那边出去。沿著来时的路。在宝库碰头。”\n"
"接著就是一片混沌。道森和哈珀分头行动。尽管你怒火中烧，但因为你清楚那条逃脱路线，所以觉得最好还是跟著道森特工。一阵脚步声和喊叫的狂潮紧随其后。你没走多远，就陷入了包围。一个身披长袍的老人瞪著他那不会眨的眼睛挡住了你的去路。“逮住他们。”他说道。你还能回想起来的事情就是一阵恐惧。盘问。那黑暗、淹没的深坑。道森的命运。哈珀在海滩上发现了你——\n"
"——你的视线刚适应回到现在，转向哈珀。看来她已经明白你瞧见了什么。危险的是，她的手伸向了枪。“要命。”她说道，“我真希望你还是别想起来上次在这洞里都发生了什么……”她颤巍巍地吸了口气。你们之间又是一阵沉默，审视著彼此。“那么，现在怎么说？”她问道，“我还有活要干。你要阻止我吗？”"
