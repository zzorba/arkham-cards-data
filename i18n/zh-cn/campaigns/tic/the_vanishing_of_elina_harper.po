"\"Wake up, dammit!\" Agent Dawson shakes you awake with his right hand. You are in the passenger seat of a pristine, state-of-the-art motorcar, its polished body glowing with light from the moon as it rolls through the foggy Massachusetts countryside. \"We're almost there,\" Dawson informs you. Unfortunately, Innsmouth lacks a working railroad, which you would have preferred. There is a bus that runs from Boston to Newburyport and another that runs from Newburyport to Innsmouth… but Dawson had insisted on driving you there himself, perhaps to provide you an escape route should things go sour, or to show off his expensive automobile. Probably both.\n"
"As you arrive in Innsmouth, the stale odor of day-old fish and decrepit, musty buildings washes over you. Many of the buildings along the western side of the town seem to be abandoned, though you occasionally spot figures in some of the windows. You imagine Agent Dawson's opulent car must make quite an impression in such a dirty and dingy town. You joke that perhaps he should have driven here in a jalopy, to which he replies with a smirk: \"That's never been my style.\"\n"
"Eventually, you reach a defunct railroad station that was given up years ago. A few train cars sit abandoned on the tracks, and the depot is boarded up and condemned. Dawson suddenly grimaces and points to another vehicle in the open lot. \"That's Agent Harper's breezer. Let's park here and continue on foot. We can move through the town a little easier that way,\" he reasons.\n"
"You check Agent Harper's vehicle before continuing, but it contains no clues as to her whereabouts. From there, you head eastward beside the Manuxet River, passing numerous deserted warehouses, sodden alleyways, and standoffish townsfolk. \"Harper's got to be somewhere in this forsaken town. Residents don't look all too friendly. Wouldn't be surprised if she drew too much attention from a local mob or the like…\" Dawson begins to contemplate aloud. You ask how he knows his agent isn't simply keeping a low profile. \"Ah yes—well, we have a code phrase for that. If she had sent me a letter saying she 'had some errands to run,' that would have signalled that she would be out of touch for a short while. Without that signal, I have to assume the worst.\" To the northeast, several factory buildings loom over the rest of the town's sagging gambrel roofs, cupolas, and widow's walks. None of the locals stop to greet you along your way. Given the repulsive countenance that many of them bear, their aversion to the usual small-town pleasantries is a relief.\n"
"Eventually, you reach the town square just south of Manuxet, though even these crumbling brick buildings that surround the supposed heart of the town inspire little confidence in Agent Harper's safety. An old bus idles nearby, its greasy-looking driver leaning against the door and eyeing you suspiciously. With little else to go on, you decide to split up, knowing that you can cover much more ground that way. \"Canvass the locals and learn more about this town,\" Dawson says. \"Find out who the big shots are in this hellhole. One of them is bound to know where Harper was last seen, or who she was with. I'm going to see if I can find where she was hiding out and look for some sign of her. Meet up with me here at 1900 hours. Understood?\" You nod in agreement and go your separate ways.\n"
"The first person you check with is the bus driver, who probably has a decent understanding of the town. His coarse, greyish skin is the first thing you notice, followed swiftly by unusually deep and shadowed creases in the flesh of his neck, almost as if he were prematurely aged. His bulging eyes are unsettling, and you're suddenly unsure whether you've seen him blink even once as you approach. You start to offer your hand as you introduce yourself, then think better of it, just in case the man has some kind of disease you've never heard of. He introduces himself as Joe Sargent and gives you a useful—if cursory—rundown of some of the nearby buildings."

"“醒醒！他妈的！”道森特工用右手把你摇醒。你坐在一辆一等一的崭新轿车里，穿行于马萨诸塞州烟雾朦胧的乡间小道。月光洒下来，把锃光发亮的车子照得熠熠生辉。“我们就要到了。”道森告诉你。其实你更想坐火车来此，但不幸的是，并没有运营的铁路通往印斯茅斯。从波士顿到纽伯里波特，再从纽伯里波特到印斯茅斯，这一路上倒是有巴士通行……但道森坚持要自己开车带你去。兴许他是打算留下逃跑路线，以备不时之需，或者只是想显摆他这辆昂贵的新车。又或者，两者都是。\n"
"你刚一到印斯茅斯，烂鱼和发霉的旧房子发出的腐臭就劈头盖脸地袭来。村子西边有许多房子看著已经废弃，但你不时还能瞧见窗边闪过人影。你不禁觉得，在这样一座肮脏昏暗的小村子里，道森特工华美的轿车肯定引人注目。你打趣说他该开辆破车来的，但他对你微微一笑：“那可不是我的风格。”\n"
"你们最终来到了一座已经废弃数年的火车站。铁轨上横躺著几节车厢，原本停车的地方已经用木板围了起来，标志著此处并不安全。道森脸色突然一变，指著空地上的另一架车：“这是哈珀特工的敞篷车。我们就在这儿停车，接下来的路步行。要穿越村子，这样更方便。”他说的有理有据。\n"
"你停下来查看了一番哈珀特工的车，但其中并无她下落的踪迹。你由此沿著马奴赛特河向东，穿过无数废弃的仓库，潮湿的小巷和冷漠的村民。“哈珀肯定就在这座偏远小村的某个地方。这里的居民都不太友好。要是当地的帮派，或者别的什么人注意到了她，那我可不意外……”道森将自己所思大声地说了出来。你提出或许他手下的特工只是想低调行事。“啊，对了——这么说吧，我们对此可是有暗号的。要是她给我寄信写道‘要处理点事情’，那就标志著她会失联一段时间。现在连这个讯息都没有，我只能假设发生了最坏的情况。”在村子东北边，圆圆方方的屋顶和天台下面藏著几间工厂。一路上并无当地人停下来和你们打招呼。考虑到他们之中许多人面目可憎，此地并无乡间惯常的热情质朴倒是一件好事。\n"
"最后你来到了马奴赛特河南边的村镇广场，这里大概就是村子的中心，但四周砖屋倾颓，让你担心哈珀特工的安危。一辆旧巴士懒在路边，油腻的司机靠著车门，满腹狐疑地望著你。你们毫无头绪，决定分头行动，扩大调查的范围。“和当地人谈谈，再打听点这村子的事情。”道森说道，“找出这破地方到底是谁说了算。肯定有人知道哈珀最后出现在哪儿，又是和谁在一块儿。我去看看能不能找到她藏在哪儿，或是有没有她留下的记号。晚上七点和我在这儿碰头。明白吗？”你点点头，与他分道扬镳。\n"
"你打听的头一个人就是那巴士司机，他看起来对村子很熟。你最先注意到的是他粗糙发灰的皮肤，紧接著就是他脖子上深深的褶皱，蒙了阴影，看上去老得诡异。他臌胀的双眼令人不安，而你也不敢确定，自己走近的时候，他是否眼睛一眨都不眨。你伸手介绍自己，但随即就收回了手，要是他得了某种你从未耳闻的疾病该怎么办？他说自己名叫乔·萨金特，向你简要地介绍了一番附近几幢房子——虽然简略，但倒也挺有用。"

msgid "What follows is a summary of the information conveyed to the investigators about the town of Innsmouth."
msgstr "以下是调查员搜集到的有关印斯茅斯的信息汇总。"

msgid "In plain view of the town square is a grocery of the First National chain, run by a youngster by the name of Brian Burnham, an outsider from Arkham. The idea that somebody else from Arkham might be here fills you with some degree of hope, and perhaps a little bit of pity for the boy."
msgstr "正对著村镇广场的是国立第一杂货铺，现在操持店面的是一个来自阿卡姆的小伙子，名叫布里安·伯纳姆。这儿居然还有人来自阿卡姆。这样的念头让你有了点希望，同时也有点同情这个男孩。"

msgid "The Gilman House, owned by Othera Gilman, is the only hotel in town. Considering its shabby appearance, you suddenly wish you'd only planned a day trip."
msgstr "欧斯拉·吉尔曼的吉尔曼旅社是村子里唯一的旅店。看它这破破烂烂的样子，你真希望自己这趟旅程是一日来回。"

msgid "Down the street from the Gilman House, tucked between a dismal restaurant and a drugstore, is the Little Bookshop, so named not for its size, but after its owner, Joyce Little. Mr. Sargent doesn't seem to care much for her."
msgstr "沿著吉尔曼旅社旁的路往下走，挤过惨淡的餐厅和药店，就到了小利透书店。这家书店的名字倒不是因为占地小，而是因为店主名叫乔伊斯·小利透。但萨金特先生似乎并不怎么喜欢她。"

msgid "To the north, along the Manuxet, is the Marsh Refining Company, the centerpiece of the town's only industry. Joe speaks of its owner, Barnabas—whom he calls \"Old Man Marsh\"—with a measure of reverence and admiration."
msgstr "沿著马奴赛特河往北，就到了马什精炼公司，村子里唯一产业的核心。一提到公司的老板巴纳巴斯——人称“老马什”，乔就带著一股景仰和崇拜。"

msgid "Mr. Sargent tells you to avoid the old bridge along Fish Street, which is collapsed from years of disrepair and now serves only as a haunt for the dispossessed. \"An' don' listen to that drunk, Zadok,\" the bus driver warns. \"'Is tales are jus' that. Tales. Nothin' more.\""
msgstr "萨金特告诫你避开鱼街上的旧桥，那里年久失修，如今只有无家可归的流浪汉在此游荡。“也别瞎听那老醉鬼扎多克的。”巴士司机警告道，“他扯淡的故事就只是故事。别的啥也不是。”"

msgid "Farther east, past Water Street, lies Innsmouth Harbour. Sargent warns you not to get in the way of the dockworkers or their business, for they are a rowdy bunch who aren't used to outsiders—especially the ironically-named Robert Friendly, whose name Sargent utters with a hint of hostility."
msgstr "东边远处，过了水街，就是印斯茅斯港口。萨金特警告你别管码头工人和他们的事，这帮人又吵又不喜欢外来者，没什么礼貌——尤其是罗伯特·弗兰得礼(译者注：“弗兰得礼”原文为friendly，在英语中代表“友善”)——他这名字可真是讽刺极了。萨金特提到这名字的时候，语气可不太友好。"

msgid "To the north, on New Church Green, there exists an old Masonic Hall, now given over to an organization referred to as the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\" What truly goes on inside this old, decrepit building is anyone's guess."
msgstr "北边的新格林教堂本来是一座共济会的礼堂，但现在已经交给了一个名为“达贡密教”的组织。这栋老旧破房里面到底发生著什么根本无人知晓。"

msgid ""
"Finally, Mr. Sargent asks you what you're doing in Innsmouth. You dodge the question with one of your own, asking him if he has seen anybody around town matching Agent Harper's description. He pauses, then shakes his head. \"Never seen 'er,\" he mutters, refusing to meet your gaze.\n"
"You spend the rest of the day learning the layout of the town and attempting in vain to make conversation with the locals. The more time you spend in this strange, squalid town, the more you wish you had never taken Agent Dawson up on his offer. There is something foul in the air here, something rotten and fetid that disturbs you to your core.\n"
"Later that night, you meet up with Agent Dawson in the now-deserted town square and share what you have learned. \"Take a look at this,\" he says, handing you a creased, ink-stained letter addressed to him. \"Turns out Harper had a room at that disgusting old hotel. Still does, technically, but it seemed like she hadn't been around for a few days. I broke in and found this among her things.\"\n"
"Judging from the unmailed letter, it seems Agent Harper knew something in town was tracking her movements. <i>I'm being followed</i>, the missive explains. <i>Don't know how they know, but they know. It's like the whole town is in on something. I have no contacts here whom I trust. I'm going to require more than one agent to sort this out, I fear--</i>\n"
"The letter is cut short. \"Well, she has more than one agent now,\" Dawson says bitterly once you are done reading. \"There's only one reason she wouldn't have sent this letter. Harper's in danger, and somebody in this balled-up town knows where she is.\" Together, you begin to formulate a plan to find Agent Harper. First, narrow down her last known location. Second, find out who knew she was in town. Then… pay them a visit."
msgstr ""
"萨金特最后问你来印斯茅斯干什么。你闪烁其词，转而描述了一番哈珀特工的特征，问他在村里有没有见过相仿的人。他顿住了，摇了摇头。“从没见过。”他嘟囔著躲开了你的眼神。\n"
"这天接下来的时候你都在研究村子的布局，徒劳无功地试图和当地人对话。你在这座诡异肮脏的村子里每多待一分，就越觉得自己不该接下道森特工的案子。这里的空气中有什么污秽的，腐败的，恶臭的东西，侵蚀了你的内心。\n"
"夜里晚些时候，你和道森特工在广场碰头，交换信息。此时广场已经空无一人。“瞧瞧这个。”他说著递给你一封折起的信。信上墨水浸染，正是写给他的。“看来哈珀在那栋恶心的老旅社定了个房间。细究起来的话，她的房间还在那儿，只是已经几天没见著人了。我闯了进去，在她的东西里找到了这个。”\n"
"从这封没有寄出的信看来，哈珀特工知道有人正盯著她的一举一动。<b>有人跟著我</b>。信上说道。<b>我不知道他们是怎么发现的，但他们的确发现了。看起来整座村子都参与其中。我在这里没有可以相信的线人。要弄清这里发生的事情，仅仅一名特工是不够的，我担心——</b>\n"
"信戛然而止。“好吧，她现在是有不止一名特工了。”你读完的时候，道森的语气颇为尖刻。“只有一个解释能说明她为什么没把信寄出。哈珀身陷危险。这混蛋村子里有人知道她在哪儿。”你们一起制定了寻找哈珀特工的计划。第一步，缩小范围，排除出她最后现身的地方。第二步，找出谁知道她在村子里。然后……敲开这人的大门。"

msgid "Agent Dawson has briefed you on your task and prepared you for this mission. Each investigator may now spend the experience recorded under \"Unspent Experience\" in the Campaign Log."

Fearing the worst, you press up against the wall and wait in perfect silence. There is no escape from your room other than a narrow window of dirty glass that you don't think you can fit through. Your heart thumps loudly in your chest as you wait for whatever is to come—a knock on the door, a break-in anything. You certainly aren't expecting a small leather notebook to slip through the crack under your door, though that's exactly what happens.\n"
"After a moment, you breathe a sigh of relief and step forward to examine the notebook. It's an old handwritten accound describing the history of the strange town of Innsmouth as far back as the early eighteen hundreds, though the author goes unnamed. The record seems to focus primarily on Obed Marsh's founding of a strange organization called the Esoteric Order of Dagon. You don't remember any manuscripts of this sort on sale at the local bookstore, nor do you think the town has any libraries to speak of. Where was this notebook found, and who delivered it to you?\n"

One thing becomes clear: whatever the Esoteric Order of Dagon is, its members must be the ones behind Agent Harper's kidnapping. And just as Agent Dawson suspected, their motives seem to have nothing to do with evading prohibition…"

"片刻之后，你松了口气，前进一步仔细查看笔记。这是一本古旧的匿名手写记录，上面描述的是印斯茅斯这一古怪渔村自打十九世纪早期以来的历史。这份记录主要聚焦于奥贝德·马什创办的一个诡异组织，名为“达贡密教”。你丝毫不记得当地书店里有卖任何这种手稿，也不知道村子里有提到什么图书馆。这本笔记到底是在哪儿找到，又是谁送给你的？\n"

"\"P-please miss, y-you have to believe me!\" Brian stammers. Agent Harper stands over the seventeen-year-old and taps threatingly on the holster of her firearm. \"I didn't have a choice, I'm telling you! It was the Order! Th-they made me do it!\"\n"

Certainly a low point in my career.\" You offer that it was precisely his bumbling nature that allowed the boy to catch her off guard. \"I suppose you're right. Anyhow, what's done is done. What do you make of all this?\" she asks, crossing her arms. \"The boy seems to think it was wiser to ambush a federal agent than runa foul of this 'Order.' Think he's telling the truth?\"\n"

"哈珀翻了个白眼，转向你：“难以置信，我居然被这傻小子摆了一道。真是我生涯的黑历史了。”你说或许正是这小伙子笨手笨脚，才让她放松了警惕。“我觉得你是对的。不管了，木已成舟。你对这事儿怎么看？”她叉著手问道，“这孩子觉得与其违抗‘密教’，还不如袭击联邦特工。你觉得他说的是真话吗？”\n"

"Othera struggles against her bonds, trying like hell to free herself. \"Let me go! You have to let me go!\" she cries. Agent Harper grins, reveling in this turn of events.\n"
"\"Doesn't feel so good, does it?\" she teases.\n"
"\"You don't understand,\" Othera replies. \"Come. Look. You'll see.\" She motions to the door next to her, which you haven't yet searched. Inside is a stash of oil paintings, dozens and dozens of them, all depicting the same thing: a tumultuous maelstrom in the middle of the ocean, over which the sun and the moon hang in perfect alignment against a red-tinged sky. \"What in the hell…?\" Agent Harper wonders aloud as she sorts through the many reproductions.\n"
"Othera bites her lip, and a single tear streaks down her cheek. \"It's the Order,\" she whispers. \"The Order owns us all.\""

"欧斯拉拼命挣扎著，想要自己解脱束缚。“让我走！你必须让我走！”她叫道。哈珀特工笑了，现在情势逆转她可是高兴极了。\n"
"“这样的感觉并不好，是吧？”她讥笑道。\n"
"“你什么都不懂。”欧斯拉回道，“好吧。看吧。你等著瞧。”她指向旁边一扇你之前没有搜查过的门。里面是成打成打的油画，都画著同一样东西：大洋中央狂乱的巨型漩涡，略带红色的天空上日月完美排成一线。“这他妈是……？”哈珀特工在诸多复制品中翻找分类的时候大声发问道。\n"
"欧斯拉咬紧嘴唇，面颊上划过一滴泪。“是密教。”他低声说道，“密教掌控了我们所有。"

"Despite her situation, Joyce does little to resist you once you have her restrained. She seems resigned to her fate, her gaze elsewhere as you question her. \"Believe me, if I'd had another method of getting you to back off, I would have used it,\" she says to Agent Harper. \"But you were getting too close. So I did what had to be done.\"\n"
"\"I don't understand. Too close to what, exactly, Ms. Little?\" Harper asks.\n"
"\"There is a secret at the heart of this town. A secret that brings us wealth. A secret that brings us power. A secret that brings us…\" She pauses to find the right words. \"…closer to our destiny.\"\n"
"\"And what kind of secret is that?\" Harper probes.\n"
"Joyce smirks and shakes her head. \"What makes you think I would ever share that with outsiders?\"\n"
"\"Because you assaulted a federal agent, and if you don't tell me what I want to know, your 'destiny' is going to be the inside of a lonely prison cell.\"\n"
"You watch Ms. Little's confidence shatter. She gulps down the last of her pride. A beat of sweat drips down her forehead. \"It started with the Order,\" she explains quietly."

"尽管当前处境不妙，乔伊斯却没花什么大力气反抗你的拘禁。她看起来已向命运低头，在你询问的时候把目光投往别处。“相信我，要是有别的办法能阻止你，我不会这么做的。”她对哈珀特工说道，“但你靠得太近。我只能这么做。”\n"
"“我不明白。到底是靠什么太近，小利透女士？”哈珀问道。\n"
"“这个村子中藏著一个秘密。这秘密让我们富有。这秘密让我们强大。这秘密让我们……”她顿了顿，想找到正确的说法，“……接近自己的归宿。”\n"
"“那是什么秘密呢？”哈珀追问。\n"
"乔伊斯哂笑著摇了摇头：“你怎么会觉得，我会跟外来者说这些呢？”\n"
"“因为你袭击了联邦特工，要是你不把我想知道的事情都说出来，你的‘归宿’就是孤零零的牢房。”\n"
"你看到小利透女士的自信瓦解了。她咽下自己最后一丝骄傲，额前淌过一滴冷汗。“都是从密教开始的。”她轻轻地解释道。"

"Barnabas spits in your face as you attempt to interrogate him. \"I ain't tellin' you a word, interloper,\" he barks, his bulging eyes unblinking as he glowers at you with unbridled hate. \"You don't belong here. All o' your kind'll be dead before the week's end.\"\n"
"Agent Harper narrows her eyes at the strange man's remarks. \"What do you mean by that, Marsh? Our kind? What—outsiders?\"\n"
"Barnabas scowls, his bulbous lips curling back to reveal sharp, inhuman teeth. \"Outsiders. Intruders. You're a blight on our fair town. But you'll be purged soon enough.\"\n"
"You are taken aback by the severity of the old man's threat and his simmering hatred, but Harper simply chortles. \"You call this place 'fair'?\" Ignoring her derision, you warn Barnabas that if he doesn't speak up, he'll be spending a long time behind bars.\n"
"\"Not I,\" he remarks. \"You're the one who'll be locked up, 'n worse. When the Order's done with you, you'll be nothin' but fish food.\"\n"
"You and Harper exchange a knowing glance. She pries further: \"What Order is this, exactly?\""

"就在你要询问巴纳巴斯的时候，他啐了你一口。“我一个字也不会说，入侵者！”他带著满满的恨意瞪著你说道，臌胀的眼睛一眨也不眨。“你不属于这里。这周结束前，所有你们这种人都得死。”\n"
"听到这男人古怪的话语，哈珀特工眯起了眼睛：“你是什么意思，马什？我们这种人？哪种——外来者？”\n"
"巴纳巴斯怒目而视，他膨胀的嘴唇翻起，露出了非人的尖利牙齿：“外来者。入侵者。你们是咱这美丽小村里的害虫。但你们很快就会被清除了。”\n"
"这老人严重的威胁和喷薄的恨意将你吓退一步，但哈珀只是咯咯笑道：“你管这地方叫‘美丽”？”你无视她的嘲笑，警告巴纳巴斯他要是不坦白，可就得在牢里待上不少时候了。\n"
"“我才不会。”他说道，“你们才会给关起来，或者更惨。只要密教抓住你们，你们就得通通喂鱼去。”\n"
"你和哈珀交换了一个明瞭的眼神，她更进一步提问：“这个密教到底是什么？”"

"\"Heh, heh, heh, heh… ye startin' to see haow rott'n this town's got, ain't ye?\" Zadok hollers, a crazed look in his wide eyes. He clutches desperately at your arm, not seeming to care about your attempts to bind him. \"We're all in their clutches now, we are! Heh, heh, heh!\"\n"
"\"What's this blotto have to laugh about?\" Agent Harper mocks. \"Hey, Zadok. Stop it with the nonsense and tell us what your game is.\"\n"
"Zadok rocks back and forth, his voice growing louder and bolder. \"My game? My game?\" he roils with manic laughter. \"Yeh think I'm to blame, but them fish devils are in our midst, they are! Haven't ye seen them?\" He grins. \"Haven't ye seen them monsters crawlin' an' bleatin' an' barkin' an' hoppin' araoun' the black streets? Haven't ye heard the haowlin' errey night from the churches an' the Order o' Dagon Hall? Don'tcha know what's doin' the haowlin'? Eh?

"“呵，呵，呵，呵……你这伙子人想知道这村子有多烂呗，是不？”扎多克瞪大的眼睛里满是疯狂，大声叫道。他不顾一切地抓住你的胳膊，看起来一点也不在乎你要把他绑住。“俺们今儿个都被抓著了，俺们都是！呵，呵，呵！”\n"
"“这酒鬼到底在笑啥？”哈珀特工嘲笑道，“嘿，扎多克。别莫名其妙地笑了，告诉我们你在玩什么把戏。”\n"
"扎多克前后摇著，声音越来越大。“我的把戏？我的把戏？”他被激怒了，狂笑著，“你觉得作怪的是俺，但那些鱼魔就在我们中间，就在！你瞧不见他们吗？”他咧嘴笑道，“你瞧不见妖怪们在黑咕隆咚的街上叫唤，窜来窜去？你听不著他们每个夜上都在达贡密教的厅堂里乱嚎？不知他们嚎了些啥？嗯？是吗？”他的声音越来越高，化作尖叫，然后又低沉下去，变成一阵大笑。\n"

"Robert refruses to say a word until you get him a cigar. You begrudgingly oblige, hoping that your generosity yields dividends. \"I was investigating the docks when he and his cronies nabbed me,\" Agent Harper recounts bitterly. You ask who these \"cronies\" were, and she shrugs. \"Not sure. Dockworkers and sailors, I imagine. Whoever hired Mr. Friendly over here must have a lot of influence over the locals.\"\n"
"After handing Robert the cigar he demanded, you are surprised to find him a little more compliant, though no more friendly despite his name. \"Doesn't matter,\" he mutters, blowing out a puff of rank cigar smoke. \"You're all dead men walking. No offense, miss.\"\n"
"\"Offense taken,\" she bites back. \"Care to tell us what you mean by that?\"\n"
"\"The Order,\" he replies with a quiet, unwavering resolve. \"They know everything that happens in this town. Probably out lookin' for me right now. You sure you wanna be here when they find me?\" He flashes a sadistic grin.\n"

"罗伯特表示他什么都不会说，除非你给他一支烟。你不情不愿地给了他，希望自己这番大方能有所回报。“他们这帮货色抓住我的时候，我正调查码头呢。”哈珀特工愤懑地说道。你问她“这帮货色”指的是什么，而她耸了耸肩：“不确定。码头工和水手吧，我猜。能在这儿雇弗兰得礼的人，不管是谁，在当地肯定都很有势力。”\n"
"你把香烟给了罗伯特之后，惊讶地发现他确实合作了一点，尽管还是一样名不副实，没有礼貌。“无所谓。”他低声说道，吐出一口难闻的烟，“你们都已经是死人了。无意冒犯，女士。”\n"
"“冒犯到了。”她回击道，“你介意告诉我们那是什么意思吗？”\n"
"“密教。”他虽然声音不大，却有一种不可动摇的决心，“村子里发生了什么他们都知道。兴许现在就在外面找我呢。你真的想在他们找到我的时候，还待在这儿吗？”他露出一个残忍的狞笑。\n"
