"The sea rises steadily as you make your way along the coast toward the town of Innsmouth. The sun and moon align over the distant horizon, threatening a grim, uncertain future.\n"
"You remember the layout of the town and several strange faces you met during your first few days there, but nothing that transpired between then and waking up in that waterlogged pit. Agent Harper has been trying to fill you in, but with so many gaps in your memory, each explanation only perplexes you further.\n"
"\"Ever since you came to Innsmouth, things have only gotten worse. It began with the locals. Each day, they got rowdier and more hostile, especially to outsiders like you and me. Do you remember how nauseating some of them looked? Slimy, grayish skin? Wide lips, bulging eyes, that sort of thing?\"\n"
"You nod. Now that you've remembered, you almost wish you hadn't. It wasn't just the way they looked, either. Their hoarse voices croaked syllables barely resembling human speech, and they reeked of rotting fish.\n"
"\"They're the ones who've been stirring up trouble recently. And that's not all. There are other creatures skulking around Innsmouth of late. I'm sure you've seen them, too.\" She shudders. \"There's some kind of connection between the Esoteric Order of Dagon and those… things. Not sure what yet, but we'll get to the bottom of it if—\"\n"
"Agent Harper's voice trails off as she climbs to the top of the headland. Whatever has her staring agape can't be good. You reach the top, haul yourself over the ridge, and see the same devastation she does.\n"
"Innsmouth has been invaded. The same creatures you encountered in that sacrificial pit prowl the street—foul things from the depths of the sea, or perhaps beyond. They patrol the alleys and intersections, searching for something. Hunting. Makeshift barricades block the various pathways through the town as water from the Manuxet River spills out onto the streets.\n"
"\"No, this can't be…\" Agent Harper intones. A moment of silent gloom hangs between you. It is clear that Innsmouth is no longer safe. You inform Agent Harper that Agent Dawson left his vehicle near hers, at the abandoned railway station on the western edge of Innsmouth. She nods, understanding. \"Right. We have to get to the other side of town, and fast.\"\n"
"The sky above you is bathed in hues of violent crimson. With any luck, no more of that color will be spilled today."

"你沿著海岸朝印斯茅斯渔村前进的时候，海平面还在不断上升。远处的地平线上日月齐列，预示著凶险而不确定的未来。\n"
"你还记得村子的布局，以及刚来几天遇到的一些陌生面庞，但在那之后，从水漫金山的深坑里醒来之前的一段事情，完全是一片空白。哈珀特工试图帮你回想，但你的记忆中实在有太多缺失，每种解释都只是加剧了你的困惑。\n"
"“自打你来到印斯茅斯，事情就越变越糟。先是从当地人开始。他们的粗暴和敌意与日俱增，尤其是对像你我这样的外来者。你还记得他们之中一些看起来有多恶心吗？那黏滑的黑色皮肤？宽大的嘴唇，肿胀的眼睛，这类东西？”\n"
"你点点头。现在你是想起来了，但你宁愿自己没有。不仅仅是他们看上去的样子。他们嘶哑的声音发出的音节一点也不像人类，身上的臭气也像臭鱼。\n"
"“就是这群家伙最近在搞事。但这还不是全部。近来有别的生物在印斯茅斯游荡。我确信你也见过。”她打了个寒颤，“达贡密教和这些……东西之间肯定有联系。尽管还不确定是什么，但我们会一探究竟——”\n"
"哈珀特工爬上海角，她的声音矮了下去。无论她瞪著什么，都肯定不是好事。你也爬了上去，跨过岩脊，看到了她所见的灾象。\n"
"印斯茅斯已遭入侵。你在献祭深坑里遇到的生物如今已逡巡在街道上——这些邪恶的生物来自深海，又或是更深处。它们在街巷和十字路口巡逻，寻找著什么。猎杀著什么。村子里临时的屏障挡住了几条路，马奴赛特河也涨到了街上。\n"
"“不，这不可能……”哈珀特工缓缓说道。一阵沉默的凄苦横亘在你们之间。很显然，印斯茅斯已经不再安全。你告诉哈珀特工，道森特工把自己的车停在了她的车附近，就在村西头废弃的火车站里。她点点头，表示理解：“嗯。我们得到村的另一头去，而且要快。\n"
"你们头顶的天空已是一片鲜艳的血红。但愿一切顺利，你们今天莫再见血了。"

"You are in the middle of a conversation with Joe Sargent, the bus driver, but it must be several weeks earlier. The streets are not yet flooded, and all of the dilapidated, ramshackle buildings still stand, despite themselves. \"I told ye, outsider,\" Mr. Sargent says, \"There ain't no buses outta Innsmouth t'day.\" But you're not looking for a bus out of Innsmouth. You explain that you have a proposition for Mr. Sargent. He probes the street for eavesdroppers before answering. \"What kinda prop'sition?\"\n"
"You know you aren't going to get through to Mr. Sargent with a moral argument, so you appeal to his material desires instead, offering a sizable sum of money in exchange for his assistance. After returning from Devil Reef, you've found Innsmouth to be even less hospitable than normal. You are watched everywhere you go. Simply traveling on foot puts you in danger.\n"
"\"So you jus' need me to ferry you around like a chauffer, that it?\" Mr. Sargent weighs his options momentarily, then shakes your hand. \"I can do that.\""

"你知道你和萨金特说的事情见不得光，于是你想在物质上满足他以做弥补。你提出给他一大笔钱以换取帮助。自打从魔鬼礁石返回之后，你发现印斯茅斯较之以前更不友好。你处处都受到监视。步行已成了危险的事情。\n"

"The bell over the entrance to the Little Bookshop chimes as you jerk the door open. As expected, the interior is dark. Ever since your first week in town, the shop's been closed. It seems Joyce Little was not only its owner, but its only employee. Thankfully, picking the lock wasn't too difficult. You sneak between the dark, dusty shelves as you search for anything you can find about the Esoteric Order of Dagon.\n"
"The shop is quiet, and your tail hasn't followed you here. You spend some time perusing the dark, narrow rows of shelves, until you come to a basement with a chain-locked door. There's no way you're getting that door open, but the answers you seek must lay beyond. Somehow, you have to get in there. Just then, the beam of a flashlight shines through the front window of the shop. Your tail is on to you. You flee out the back door, hoping to return another time…\n"
"… and the vision ends. You are back in the present, standing in what remains of the bookshop. Flood waters have destroyed the shelving and rendered most of the books unreadable. However, from the corner of your eye, you notice the once-locked basement door is now ajar. You rush down the steps, splashing through water up to your knees. What you find is an assortment of scrolls and tomes, many in a runic, alien, yet strangely familiar language. Whatever this trove of knowledge is, it must pertain to the Esoteric Order of Dagon. You grab as much as you can find before escaping back into the flooded streets."

"你打开小利透书店的门，门上挂著的铃铛响个不停。和你预料的一样，里面空无一人。自从你来村上的第一周起，书店就关了门。看来乔伊斯·小利透不仅是书店的老板，也是店里唯一的员工。谢天谢地，撬锁并非难事。你在积尘昏暗的书架间蹑手蹑脚，找寻一切可能与达贡密教有关的东西。\n"
"商店里一片寂静，你的“尾巴”现在也还没有跟上来。你花了好些功夫在阴沉狭窄的一排排书架中寻找，最后来到了一扇铁链锁住的地窖门前。你打不开这扇门，但你要的答案一定就在下面。无论如何，你都得进去。就在这时，手电筒的光亮照过书店的前窗。追兵已至。你从后门溜走，希望之后还能回来……\n"
"……幻象消失了。你回到了现在，站在书店的残骸中。洪水摧毁了书架，大部分的书都泡在了水里，没法读了。不过，你瞥到之前锁住的地窖门已经半开。你冲下楼梯，水漫过了膝盖。你找到了一堆卷轴和典籍，大多用一种怪异的符文写成，但这种语言你却出奇得熟悉。无论其中埋藏了什么知识，都肯定和达贡密教有关。你尽量抓起所有能带走的东西，逃回了洪水漫过的街道。"

In the City of the Deep Ones!\" Her gaze seems to drill into the back of your skull.\n"
"You take her hand and politely detach it from your arm. It would appear you can't even walk down the street in this town without being accosted by some crackpot—and yet, something about the grievous look in her milky eyes gives you pause. Whatever this woman speaks of, she believes it with absolute certainty. Sighing, you ask her what she is talking about.\n"
"\"Th-they are on their way,\" she sputters. \"First, the alignment. Then the tide. Then the progeny of Mother Hydra.\" Her pale, blind eyes search for yours. Still, her absurd babbling is of no use to you. You are about to depart when she probes for your hand and presses something into your palm. \"Take it!\" she says. You hand it back to her and brush her off. You want no part of this foolishness; your task is to find Agent Harper, not collect bizarre knickknacks. Her expression sours as you turn to leave.\n"
"When you return to the present, you are standing over the woman's shredded corpse. Whatever \"nonsense\" she was spouting was in fact a genuine warning. Clutched in her stiff hand is the strange gold coin she'd offered you weeks before. This time, you take it with you."

"“它们，它们已经开始行动了。”她语无伦次，“先是天体排列成行。然后是潮水。接著就是海德拉的子嗣。”她苍白的盲目徒劳地找寻你的身影。她这一通胡说八道对你还是毫无用处。你就要离开，但她摸索著你的手，把一样东西塞进你的手心。“拿上！”她说道。你把东西还了回去，甩开了她。你可不想要这件蠢物。你来是要找到哈珀特工，不是为了搜集奇怪的小玩意儿。你转身离开的时候，她的表情一阵酸楚。\n"

You came here to visit the culprit who kidnapped Agent Harper, only to be informed by the warden that the suspect had escaped the previous night.\n"

Not only is it empty, but its bars are bent outward from the middle—enough to fit a human through, or perhaps something even larger.
