"Light flashes in your mind. Shadows drown your thoughts as the memory fades. You are lying once again on the rocky beach off the coast, your skull pounding in agony. Agent Harper leans over you with worry etched in her brow. \"Hey! Hey, you finally awake?\"\n"
"You sit up, your muscles aching. It looks like the tide rose several more inches while you were out. The cold water laps at your ankles and soaks into your shoes. \"What happened?\" she says. \"What did you see?\""
msgstr ""
"你脑海中闪过亮光。记忆褪去，又是一阵阴影笼罩。你又躺在了海岸边的岩石上，脑子里一片剧痛。哈珀特工俯身瞧著你，眉眼间全是担忧。“嘿！嘿，你终于醒了？”\n"
"你坐了起来，肌肉酸痛。看上去海水比你昏过去的时候又涨了几寸。冰水漫过你的脚踝，渗进你的鞋子。“发生了什么？”她说道，“你看到了什么？”"

"You tell Harper you remember your mission to find her, but that after a week of searching, you hadn't been able to do so. The last thing you remember was somebody slipping a notebook under your hotel room door with some information regarding an organization called the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\n"
"\"Oh. Yeah, that was me. Sorry I couldn't stick around and chat, but I had some other business to attend to,\" she explains. She tells you that after several days in captivity, she finally managed to get the upper hand against her captor and free herself, but she was injured in the process. As if to prove her story, she opens her trenchcoat, and you see dark bloodstains seeping through her button-up shirt. Several bandages peek out beneath the fabric. \"Just barely missed my kidney. Lucky me, eh?\"\n"
"You complain that you were wasting your time searching high and low for her, and she scoffs. \"Hardly! You learned more in one week than I did in two. I knew that you were onto something, and I wanted to help out, but I was still being followed. So I dropped off the one solid bit of research I'd found and laid low for a while. It was you who did the rest really.\" Sadly, you remember nothing of \"the rest.\""

"你告诉哈珀你记起了自己的任务是找到她。但搜寻一周之后，你一无所获。你能记得的最后一件事，就是有人把一本笔记扔进了你的房间，上面写著和“达贡密教”有关的消息。\n"
"“哦。对了，那是我。很抱歉我没能留下来和你详细谈谈，但我还有些别的事要做。”她解释道。她告诉你，在被俘几天之后，她终于占了绑匪的上风，自己逃了出来，但她在这过程中受了伤。她敞开自己的战壕大衣，彷佛是要证明自己的故事。你看见她扣好的衬衫上有暗色的血迹。织物下面印出几条绷带。“刚好从肾边擦过。我还挺幸运的，嗯？”\n"
"你抱怨说自己到处找她真是浪费时间，但她对此嗤之以鼻：“才不是呢！你这一周里打听到的事情比我两周里的都多。我知道你对事情有眉目了，也想来帮你，但我自己也被人跟著。我不得不暂时放下调查，蛰伏起来。其实剩下的活都是你干的。”不幸的是，你一点也不记得“剩下的活”是什么。"

"You tell Harper you remember your mission to find her and the interrogation of her kidnapper. She grins. \"Thanks again for that, by the way. I really did have things under control, though,\" she jokes. \"Do you remember anything after that?\"\n"
"You shake your head. The last thing you remember was the mention of an organization called the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\n"
"Harper mutters a curse under her breath. \"That's unfortunate. But amnesia or not, at least I know I can trust you. Whether you remember it or not, you've come through for me in the past.\""

"你告诉哈珀你记起了自己的任务是找到她，以及盘问绑匪的事情。她笑了：“顺便我还得再次为这谢谢你。尽管我其实已经自己搞定了。”她打趣道，“你还记得那之后的事情吗？”\n"
"你摇摇头。你能记得的最后一件事，就是有人提到一个叫“达贡密教”的组织。\n"
"哈珀喘息之间低声咒骂了一句。“真倒霉。但就算你忘了很多事情，至少我知道我还是能信任你的。无论你是否记得，过去你都成功找到了我。”"

msgid "Any one investigator may add the Elina Harper story asset to their deck. This card does not count against the investigators deck size."
msgstr "任意一位调查员可以选择将艾莲娜·哈珀剧情支援加入其牌组。这张卡牌不计入该调查员牌组的卡牌张数。"

msgid "\"Don't worry,\" she says, \"I'll catch you up. There's a lot you still don't remember.\" Just then, a resounding crash of thunder echoes on the eastern horizon, and a powerful wave smashes against the jetties. The sky is a deep crimson red behind blackening storm clouds that swirl around the sun and the moon. The celestial bodies hang together in perfect alignment. \"That can't be good.\" Harper's lips turn rigid with concern. \"Okay, new plan. Let's get back to Innsmouth. I'll explain what I know along the way.\""
msgstr "“别担心。”她说道，“我会都告诉你的。还有很多事情你不记得。”就在这时，东边的地平线上炸响一声雷鸣，巨浪冲刷著堤坝。天空一片深红，日月完美排成一线，四周黑云翻滚。“这可不妙了。”哈珀担忧地咬紧双唇，“好吧，计划有变。让我们回印斯茅斯去。我路上跟你解释。”"
