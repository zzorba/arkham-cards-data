"Over the next few days, you learn more about your captors, but nothing about the black galley’s destination. It seems the Corsairs who hunted you down and captured you were only agents—or perhaps slaves—of a much greater evil: a race of greyish-white toad-like creatures with no eyes and slippery skin concealed beneath a loose disguise of silken clothing. You notice the creatures tend to stay below deck, and none of them deign to interact with you at all. Despite their disguises, the mere sight of one makes you retch. If they are indeed the masters of the Corsairs, this cannot bode well for you. You are kept apart from Virgil, and suspect he is on a different ship entirely.\n"
"More days pass. You have no way of telling how long it’s been since your capture. You have been kept well fed—that is, if being forced to eat bitter porridge from a dirty clay bowl counts as “well fed.” What concerns you most is the ship itself. Though you are sure it’s still moving, you no longer feel it rock back and forth as the waves push it from side to side, nor do you hear the sounds of the ocean or of gulls cawing over the coast. In fact, you hear very little at all now: only the occasional commands of one of the beasts from below deck, and the shouting of Corsairs in reply. No churning sea. No wind in the sails. Nothing at all.\n"
"Panic seizes your mind. What if you are destined for some strange port from which there can be no return? Could they have have sailed off the face of the planet itself? You have to do something. Escape, somehow. You try desperately to come up with a plan of action, but in vain. Corsairs relentlessly patrol the brig, and even if you managed to slip your bonds and sneak past them, where would you go?\n"
"Just as you begin to lose hope, a familiar face descends from the top deck. It is the ship captain you hired in Dylath-Leen: a chubby, middleaged fellow with a bushy beard and long hair pulled into a bun atop his head. He peeks around, realizes he is alone with you, and runs to your side. “I am so sorry, my friends,” he stammers quietly. “I had no idea who I was dealing with. I was tricked, I swear. I did not know that they were…I did not know…” he trails off, red-faced with guilt. You aren’t entirely sure what he means, but obviously he had something to do with your capture. Regardless, he is your only chance at escape. You tell him all will be forgiven if he helps you. He ponders for a moment, looks around, then finally nods and slices through your bonds with a curved knife.\n"
"Freedom has never tasted so sweet. You stretch your aching muscles and search nearby for your belongings, but there is little time to waste. Keeping a lookout, your rescuer whispers, “There may be a rowboat you can use on the top deck, but we’ll have to be quiet as mice. If they spot—” his voice suddenly catches in his throat, along with a sharp, jagged blade. He makes a dreadful gurgle as blood wells in his mouth, and he collapses. Behind him, a Corsair flashes a sadistic grin at his next victims: you."

"在过去的几天里，你对那群把你抓来的海盗有了进一步的了解，但你对这艘黑船的目的地仍然一无所知。似乎那群海盗只是奉命行事——或者说是执行主人命令的奴隶——它们背后有著更为邪恶的势力：灰白色、貌似蟾蜍的一种生物，它们没有眼睛，身上罩著一件宽松的丝质衣服来掩饰自己的皮肤。你注意到，它们更喜欢待在甲板下层内，并且丝毫不屑于与你接触。尽管它们作了伪装，但你光是看到它们，就感到一阵反胃。如果它们是海盗的主人，你接下来可能要遭殃了。你与维吉尔没被关在一处，你怀疑他被关在了另一艘船上。\n"
"又过了几天。你无法判断被俘后究竟过了多久。你每顿都有饭吃——如果说脏碗里发苦的糊状物也算“饭”的话。最让你在意的是这艘船本身。虽然你确定它仍在行驶，但你已无法感觉到海浪推动它向前时的前后晃动，也听不到海浪声和岸上的海鸥鸣叫声。实际上，你现在几乎听不到什么声音：只能听到甲板下层的野兽偶尔发号施令，以及海盗们回应命令的喊叫声。海面没有涟漪。船帆没有丝毫被风吹动。什么都没有。\n"
"恐慌侵占了你的意识。要是你被带到一个陌生的港口，再也回不来了怎么办？它们是不是已经飞离了这颗星球表面？你不能坐以待毙。得设法逃出这里。你绞尽脑汁想著逃跑计划，但完全想不出来。海盗们不停地在禁闭室里巡逻，即使你解开了束缚，从它们的看守下溜走，你该去哪呢？\n"
"就在你快要失去最后一丝希望的时候，从甲板上层下来一人，是你熟悉的面孔。正是你在狄拉斯-利恩雇的船长：一个胖胖的中年男子，长著一把浓密的胡子，长长的头发在脑后梳成一个圆髻。他四处张望，发现这时只有你们二人，便跑到你旁边。“我很抱歉，朋友。”他结结巴巴地低声说，“我有眼不识泰山。我跟你发誓，我是被骗了。我当时不知道它们是……我不知道……”他说完，满脸因羞愧而变得通红。你并不清楚他说的是什么意思，但很显然，你们被俘一事跟他脱不了干系。无论如何，只有利用他才有机会逃出这里。你说，如果他帮你逃跑，你会原谅他所作的一切。他想了一会，看看周围，最后点点头，用弯刀割断了绑在你身上的绳子。\n"
"你从未感到自由的滋味竟是如此的甜美。你伸展酸痛的肌肉，在周围寻找你的行李，但时间紧迫。船长一边给你盯梢，一边低声说：“或许你可以用上层甲板的那条小艇，但我们得像老鼠一样轻手轻脚。要是被它们发现——”他的话音戛然而止，一把带有锯齿的尖刀卡在了他的喉咙。他发出了一道可怕的咯咯声，同时口中鲜血涌出，随后便倒下了。一名海盗站在他后面，狞笑著看著下一个受害者——你。"

"You have little choice if you are to save the Corsairs’ captives: You must sail to the Moon and rescue them yourself, or they will surely become slaves of the beasts who call it home. “They are evil creatures who serve an even greater evil,” Randolph explains as you prepare to set sail. “There are port cities like Dylath-Leen that have dealt with them before, but few know their true identity, for they wear disguises to mask their hideous nature.”\n"
"Perhaps your captain, who shuttled you to and from the various regions of the Dreamlands, dealt with them in the past. Or perhaps not. For the sake of your own sanity, it may be better not to dwell on suspicions of betrayal.\n"
"“How does one even sail to the Moon?” you ask, befuddled. By now, you are no stranger to the oddities of the Dreamlands, having spent weeks exploring its cities, wilds, and places stranger still. Even knowing the laws of physics and astronomy should not apply here, you struggle to imagine how one might sail a ship into space.\n"
"“It will be a long journey,” Randolph answers. “Far across the sea lie the Basalt Pillars of the West. Between these pillars, the ocean plunges off the edge of the world. If we sail off of the precipice between them, we can cross the void of space itself.”\n"
"You shouldn’t be surprised that the world of Earth’s Dreamlands is flat; after all, everything else here is a fiction, too. Still, you are incredulous. “I have sailed this route before,” Randolph says, sensing your skepticism. “But I fear this time it might be a one-way trip, especially without a crew. We may need to find an altogether different way to unknown Kadath. Are you prepared?”\n"
"You look to the horizon, where the cerulean sea meets the sky. Somewhere out there, your aid is needed. What’s more, the proof you seek may lie across the sea—over the edge of the very world itself. You prepare to embark."

"如果你想救出被这些海盗抓走的人们，你几乎没有其他选择：你必须自行航行到被那群野兽称为家园的月球，救出受害者，不然他们只会沦为野兽的奴隶。“它们是邪恶的怪物，听命于它们更为邪恶的主人。”在你准备启航时，伦道夫解释说，“像狄拉斯-利恩那样的港口城市就曾有人和它们打过交道，但因为它们靠著伪装来掩饰自己的丑恶本性，鲜少有人知道它们的真实身份。\n"
"或许载你往返幻梦境中不同区域的船长，过去就曾跟它们有来往。也可能没有。为了不让自己受到打击，还是不要纠结他是不是叛徒这件事为好。\n"
"“怎么才能飞到月亮上去？”你疑惑地问道。现在的你对幻梦境的怪事已经不再陌生，你曾花了好几个星期来探索幻梦境里的城市和荒野，以及一些至今仍感到奇怪的地方。就算知道物理学和天文学的定律在这里并不适用，你还是无法想象怎么把一艘船开到太空里去。\n"
"“要走很远的路。”伦道夫回答，“在大海那边，远远地坐落著西境玄武岩柱。在那些柱子之间，海水会从世界的边缘倾注而下。如果我们航行穿过那些柱子中央，就能穿越虚空本身。”\n"
"你不该对幻梦境的世界是平的感到惊奇；毕竟，这里的一切都是虚幻。但你仍然无法相信。“我曾经这么走过。”伦道夫察觉到你的怀疑，继续说道，“但这一次连一个船员都没有，我担心会有去无回。我们或许得另寻一条迥异的路来去往未知的卡达斯。你准备好了吗？”\n"
"你望向地平线，蔚蓝的海洋在那里与天空相接。越过那里，就能找到需要你帮助的人。而且，你要寻找的证据，或许就在大海的另一边——这个世界的边缘以外。你准备好出发了。"

"Despite your best efforts, your pursuers are too many for you to escape unnoticed. You are cornered and taken captive. Virgil tries his best to resist, but Randolph gives in, knowing that his resistance is futile. You are brought into a large domed temple on the dark side of the Moon and forced to kneel before one of the moon-beasts. It is dressed in grey robes and heavy wrappings, but you see its true visage beneath: its slippery, clammy flesh and its drooling, bulbous lips. “Wonderful,” it praises its henchmen. “Our master will be pleased.” Behind you, Corsairs prevent your escape, while a row of winged things on either side of you squawk rhythmically and flap their wings. A preparation, you suspect, for an unpleasant journey.\n"
"The moon-beast orders its slaves to haul you onto the winged creatures. “Bring these wretches to the sacrificial pits,” it decrees. “They must be judged for their heresy. The moon lizard shall feed well tonight.”\n"
"“What? No, this isn’t right.” Randolph grits his teeth.\n"
"There is a bright flash of light, and you <i>awaken</i>. You are sitting atop a comfortless and unfamiliar bed. A wave of relief washes over you at first. Have you finally awoken from this endless dream? Then the still, cold void embraces you, and you realize where you truly are. Instead of four walls and a ceiling, you are surrounded by a bright, starry cosmos. Galaxies and nebulae in the distance seem to stare back at you with unfeeling cruelty. Your bed floats along the thinnest of silver threads. Virgil’s cat sits up at your feet. “You’re not awake,” the black cat says. “Not yet.”\n"
"Another flash of light. The moon-beast orders its slaves to haul you onto the winged creatures. “Bring these wretches to the High Priest in the Cold Wastes,” it decrees. “They must be judged for their heresy.”\n"
"“Worry not, my friends,” Randolph whispers to you. “Did you hear that? The Cold Wastes is the region wherein unknown Kadath lies. With any luck, they will bring us right to our destination—” Randolph is cut off as the moon-beast grabs him and pulls him to his feet.\n"
"“No, not you. I know of you. You will be a gift. Fodder for the moon lizard. Come.” It drags Randolph away before your very eyes. His screams echo off the walls of the temple and fade as he is hauled underground. Then, borne aloft on dreadful, membranous wings, your mounts carry you into the void of space."

"尽管使尽了浑身解数，你依然无法躲过众多追兵的眼睛。它们把你逼到绝路，抓住了你。维吉尔奋力抵抗，而心知抵抗只是徒劳的伦道夫却已放弃挣扎。它们把你们带到了月球暗面的一座带有穹顶的巨大神庙，强迫你们在一头月兽面前跪下。那月兽身著灰袍，重重包裹著自己的身躯，但你从兜帽下看到了它真实的面容：它那湿滑的皮肤和那淌著口水的、外凸的嘴唇。“好极了。”它夸赞自己的手下，“我们的主人会很满意的。”许多海盗站在你们身后，防止你们逃跑，而站在你们两侧的怪物拍打著翅膀，发出规律的尖声嗥叫。你猜想这将是一趟不安旅程的前兆。\n"
"那头月兽号令它的奴仆把你们拖到带有翅膀的怪物身上。“把这些恶徒带到祭坑去。”它说道，“他们必须为自己的异端身份遭受审判。月蜥今晚会得到一顿饱餐。”\n"
"“什么？不，这样不对。”伦道夫咬紧牙关说道。\n"
"一道亮光闪过，你苏醒了。你坐在一张舒适的陌生床铺上。如释重负的感觉立马涌上了你的心头。你终于从这场漫长的睡梦中醒来了吗？随后，寒冷而静止的虚空包围著你，你才意识到自己这是在哪。在你周围的不是四面墙壁和天花板，而是繁星点缀的明亮宇宙。远处的银河与星云像是在冷冷地回视著你的目光。你的床漂浮在一条再细不过的银色丝线上。维吉尔的猫在你脚边坐起身来。“你没有醒来。”黑猫说道，“目前还没。”\n"
"又一道闪光。那头月兽号令它的奴仆把你们拖到带有翅膀的怪物身上。“把这些恶徒带到冰封荒土的高阶祭司那里去。”它说道，“他们必须为自己的异端身份遭受审判。”\n"
"“朋友们，别担心。”伦道夫对你们低声说，“你们听到了吗？冰封荒土就是卡达斯所在的地方。要是走运，它们能直接把我们带到目的地去——”伦道夫话音未落就被月兽一把拉了下来。\n"
"“不，除了你。我知道你。你会被我们送给月蜥，作为一顿饱餐。来吧。”它在你们的眼前拉走了伦道夫。伦道夫的尖叫声回荡在神庙的每个房间，随著他被带到地下，声音渐渐消失。然后，你们的坐骑扇动著可怕的膜状翅膀，带你们飞入了太空。"

"As the white galley glides silently back toward the Earth, its captain sings a soft, melodic shanty, which the ship’s oarsmen repeat. You seem to know the language well, despite having never heard it before. You ask after your course, but the bearded man does not reply other than to continue his harmonious song. You plead with him to aid you in your search for unknown Kadath, believing it to be of the utmost importance. “You should not seek to disturb the gods,” the man warns, his song interrupted. “They are far greater than you or I. Do you not see the folly in your ambition?” You beseech him once more, telling him you must bring back proof of the Dreamlands, and cannot return home without the aid of the gods. “Would that be so dire a fate? Look around you.”\n"
"You do as the captain requests, and are met with a scene of such serene beauty that it leaves you breathless. The seas below glitter in the moonlight like an ocean of diamonds. Along the horizon, you see crystalline coastlines, blissful countrysides, lush mountain vistas, and emerald-green gardens. The air is crisp and cool as you descend below the clouds. Your heart swells with the sweet fragrance of flowers from the nearby coast. Never in all your years in “reality” have you experienced a beauty so <i>real</i>.\n"
"Maybe staying wouldn’t be so bad. You’ve already spent weeks—no, months—in this land. There have been hardships, yes, but could you really return to your mundane reality after everything you’ve seen and experienced in this wondrous land?\n"
"Then, far to the north, you see it. Looming just over the horizon, or perhaps beyond the dreams of Earth itself. A white peak, atop which sits an azure beacon of refracted moonlight. The bearded man follows your gaze. “So be it,” he sighs. He changes course, following now behind a celestial bird whose plumage matches the vibrant sky. “We sail to the abode of the gods themselves.”"

"当白船静静地朝地球驶去，船长唱起一首轻柔而优美的船夫曲，划桨的船夫也随声唱和。你似乎熟知他们的语言，尽管你之前从未听过。你问船长他将要驶向何处，但这个大胡子并没有回答你，只是继续唱著他那悦耳的歌曲。你恳求他帮你寻找未知的卡达斯，这是你心目中的第一要务。“你不该寻找那个地方，打扰神明。”他停止歌唱，警告你，“祂们远比你我崇高。难道你还没发觉自己的野心是如此愚蠢吗？”你再次恳求，说你必须带回幻梦境存在的证据，得到神明的帮助才能回到家园。“回不去就有那么糟吗？看看你的周围吧。”\n"
"你依言环顾四周，目之所及是一派令人屏息凝神、宁静而美好的景象。下方的海洋在月光照耀下波光粼粼，就像一池宝钻。沿著地平线，可以看到水晶般的海岸线，无忧无虑的村庄，苍翠繁茂的群山，以及翠绿的花园。当你下降到云层之下，清新的空气扑面而来。附近海岸的花香盈满你的心窝。你在“现实世界”的这些年来，从未感受过如此真实的美景。\n"
