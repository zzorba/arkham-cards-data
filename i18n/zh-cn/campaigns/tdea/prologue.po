"Something odd was happening in Arkham, Massachusetts.\n"
"Typically, this would not be a surprise to the residents of the dreary New England town. Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance, however, was anything but typical.\n"
"It all began in the latest issue of <i>Tales from Nevermore</i>. A writer by the name of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the moon, and a curious talking cat…among other things equally difficult to believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention. Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, <i>Tales from Nevermore</i> began to receive and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the ears of experts.\n"
"Virgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently, experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?\n"
"You and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong…"

"马萨诸塞州的阿卡姆镇发生了一些怪事。\n"
"通常来说，这座阴郁的新英格兰小镇上的居民并不会对其大惊小怪。阿卡姆的确一直以怪事——有人称之为超自然现象——著称。然而，这次的情况实际上前所未见。\n"
"一切要从最新一期《传奇故事》说起。一位名叫维吉尔·格雷的作家写下了自己梦中经历的一次旅行——他声称这不是自己编造的小说。他描写了一条长长的螺旋楼梯、一柱灼热难当、似是活物的火焰、一棵来自月球的树、一只会说话的古怪猫……还有其他难以置信的景象。但最初吸引你注意力的并不是这篇非同寻常的故事。维吉尔的故事刊登后不久，《传奇故事》陆续收到并刊登了一封封信件，寄信人阅读维吉尔的故事后声称经历过一模一样的梦境。不久，阿卡姆报社报道了这则故事，以及专家们也得知了这一奇怪现象的新闻。\n"
"有人说服作者维吉尔·格雷到当地的精神病院接受治疗，许多和他一样精神错乱的人也被送进了精神病院。学界普遍认为维吉尔的梦境真实到他本人分不清现实与虚幻，而他的作品将他的幻觉传播给他人，使读者也变得歇斯底里。你仍然无法接受这一结论。毕竟，人类对于做梦这个行为仍不甚了解。对于睡眠中的大脑状态，医学专家的各种理论之间存在较大分歧。近来，包括西格蒙德·弗洛伊德在内的许多专家认为，梦是一个人潜意识里的欲望、恐惧或执念的表现。预言家们则一直以来都相信，通过筛选和解释梦境，就能得知入梦者的过去和未来。但是，如果这些理论都是真的，那么怎会有那么多人——来自各行各业的人——都梦到同一段经历？假如当代对睡眠的所有理解都是错的呢？假如我们的意识在睡梦中真的能到达一个地方——存在于清醒世界以外的梦之国度呢？\n"
"你和你的同伴们聚集起来，彻查这一怪事的真相。如果说这座镇上有人能进入梦中世界，那么，或许你们也能。你已经梦到了维吉尔所经历的梦境，完全一致。如果一切顺利，你们中的一半人将出发前往“幻梦境”并返回。其余的人将留在清醒世界，研究同伴的睡眠模式以确保一切正常……"
