"<i>Following scenario 1–A, the dreamers travel beyond the Enchanted Woods…</i>\n"
"As you travel out of the Enchanted Woods, you pass through rolling green meadows under a bright-blue, cloudless sky. You speak with the blond-haired man—who introduces himself as Randolph Carter— for several hours along your journey south. You pass through a town Randolph calls Nir and over a stone bridge spanning a wide river. Since the man seems friendly and knowledgeable about both your world and this one, you explain to him your situation: that you had followed the writings of a man named Virgil Gray to reach this strange land, in order to see for yourself the truth of his story. “There is a place in Ulthar where you may yet meet this man for yourself,” Randolph responds. “When we reach Ulthar, I will show you.”\n"
"The town of Ulthar is not quite what you had imagined. The border of the town is marked by a cobblestone road separating its quaint cottages from the rolling green meadows beyond. Inside the town, narrow cobbled streets are filled almost to capacity with cats of all kinds and colors, which part as you approach. Old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories arch over the hilly streets; the entire village seems a haphazard cluster of homes and old-fashioned businesses. As you reach the town square near the center of the village, Randolph stops and addresses you with a youthful smile. “Welcome to Ulthar,” he proclaims. “As I mentioned before, you are quite safe here. There is but one paramount law to keep in mind as you traverse this place: in the town of Ulthar, no one may kill a cat.” Given how utterly packed the streets are with cats, you wonder aloud if this is indeed a town run by cats. “Not quite,” Randolph replies, pondering your words, “though I suppose one might call it the center of cat society here in the Dreamlands. The reason for that law’s existence is a story for another time. First, come—I have a feeling we’ll find this ‘Virgil’ fellow you speak of at Einar’s.”\n"
"Randolph leads you through the town square, which is surrounded by buildings adorned with cat motifs in the form of statues, signs, and even stained-glass windows. You eventually arrive at one such building bearing a sign that reads “Einar’s Place.” Inside is a medieval-style tavern filled with long wooden tables. You spot several patrons and three times as many cats. One such patron at the wooden counter feeds one of the cats small strips of dried meat. He is a handsome man in his early thirties, with short dark hair, a strong jaw, and sharp cheekbones. You recognize him instantly as the writer Virgil Gray. In the back of your mind, you wonder if this chance meeting is merely an act of fortune or something preordained, for good or for ill.\n"
"Regardless, you approach the man and introduce yourself, along with Randolph. Virgil shakes your hand and Randolph’s with a joyful smile. “Well met, fellow dreamers!” the writer says, a hint of boyish excitement in his voice. “It is wonderful to meet more fellow believers. I had become so sick and tired of reading about my supposed ‘illness’ in the papers.”\n"
"You nod your head in agreement and inform Virgil that you intend to find some proof of this discovery to bring back to the waking world. “Don’t you think I tried that?” he replies, stymied. “Sadly, it is impossible for one who is asleep to bring anything from this realm into the real world. This is all imagination, you see. Ideas, concepts, fantasies. You cannot hold a thought in your hands, can you?”\n"
"Randolph interjects. “There is a place within the Dreamlands that may hold the proof you seek. I have seen it in my dreams. I visited there three times, each time just a fleeting moment before I was snatched away by the rising sun…but try as I might, I cannot find the way again. I have spent many nights searching.”\n"
"“Oh?” Virgil asks, intrigued. “And what is this place?”\n"
"“It is a marvelous city,” he describes, his eyes aglow with wonder, “golden and lovely like nothing I have seen before or since. A city beyond the peaks of the unknown mountain Kadath, where no one has ever set foot before. There, veiled within the clouds and crowned by stars, lies the onyx castle of the Great Ones.”\n"
"Virgil idly pets the cat on the countertop next to him as he is absorbed by Randolph’s tale. It is a slender creature with lustrous black fur, dark as the void of space itself. “Then we must find this place! Even if it does not have the proof we seek, it sounds like the adventure of a lifetime. Enough to fill a hundred pages, or more!”\n"
"You tell Virgil and Randolph that before you commit to such an adventure, you must return to the waking world and tell your companions about your experiences. Just then, another voice, cryptic and quiet, chimes: “Oh, you can’t wake up. The eye is upon you now.”\n"
"You and the others spin your heads around, searching for the source of the voice. The barkeeper? Another patron? Then Virgil’s black cat stretches and sits up, its piercing yellow eyes reflecting the light of the sun through the window outside. “I have waited a long time for you to seek Kadath,” it says.\n"
"“You can talk?” Virgil says, nearly toppling over his stool as he jumps in surprise.\n"
"“I’m a cat, you dolt. Of course I can talk,” the black cat replies, licking its paw out of boredom. “You have met a thousand cats from Ulthar, and now you are surprised?”\n"
"“But…I thought…” Virgil wipes his brow with his palm.\n"
"“Never mind him,” the black cat says, addressing you directly. “I assure you, you cannot cross back into the waking world until you find Kadath. It is your only way out. In the meantime, I will return and tell your companions about the quest ahead of you.” It hops off of the countertop and walks confidently toward the exit. “Though I imagine their task will be even more arduous…”"

"<i>在冒险1-A之后，入梦者走出了魔幻森林……</i>\n"
"你走出魔幻森林后，经过一片连绵起伏的翠绿草地，头上是万里无云的蔚蓝天空。往南方前进的过程中，你与那名自称伦道夫·卡特的金发男子聊了好几个小时。你经过了一座被伦道夫称为涅尔的小城，走过一条横跨大河的石桥。因为他看起来很友善，并且对于你的世界和这个世界都十分了解，于是你向他说明你的情况：你随著一位名叫维吉尔·格雷的人所写的文章来到这个奇怪的地方，是为了亲眼确认他的故事是真是假。“你或许能在乌撒的某个地方见到他。”伦道夫接道，“等我们到了乌撒，我会带你到那儿去的。”\n"
"乌撒之城和你想象中的不太一样。这座小城的边界是一条鹅卵石路，这条路隔开了古朴的农舍与连绵起伏的草地。在这座小城中，狭窄的鹅卵石街道上几乎全是各种各样、形形色色的猫，你一走近它们就散开了。倾斜的街道上方拱悬著几层尖屋顶的楼房；整个小城似乎全是杂乱无章的住宅群，并且在这儿经营的都是些老式行业。你来到城中心的广场时，伦道夫停下脚步，露出充满朝气的微笑向你致意：“欢迎来到乌撒。”他宣告道，“就像我之前提到的，在这儿你会比较安全。你在这儿只需要遵守一条至高法律：在乌撒之城，任何人都不能杀害猫。”想到街道上全是猫，你大声发问这座小城是不是被猫统治的。“不完全是。”伦道夫思考著你说的话，答道，“虽然我想人们可能会把这里称为幻梦境的猫界中心。下次再跟你说那条法律是怎么来的。先过来——我感觉，你说的那个‘维吉尔’老哥就在艾纳酒馆。”\n"
"伦道夫带你穿过广场，这周围的建筑物都装饰有猫咪元素，包括雕像、标志，甚至连彩窗上也是。最后你来到一幢有著“艾纳酒馆”招牌的建筑前。里面是中世纪风格的小酒馆，摆满了长长的木桌。你注意到这里有几名客人，还有数量是他们三倍的猫咪。木质吧台旁边，一名客人正在用小条的肉干喂猫。他相貌英俊，像是三十出头，留著黑色短发，有著刚毅的下颌和高高的颧骨。你马上认出了他就是那位作者，维吉尔·格雷。在你内心深处，你好奇这次相遇究竟是巧合还是命运的安排，是好事还是坏事。\n"
"不论如何，你和伦道夫一同走近他并作自我介绍。维吉尔脸上带著喜悦的笑容，与你二人握手：“很高兴见到你们，入梦者同道！”作者说著，话语声中带著一丝孩子气的激动，“见到更多相信我的朋友真是太好了。我已经厌倦了报纸上关于我所谓‘疾病’的报道。”\n"
"你点头表示赞同，告诉维吉尔你来这里是为了从这次探索中找到一些证据，将它们带回现实世界。“你以为我没试过这么做吗？”他挫败地回道，“可悲的是，一个睡著的人是没法把这个世界的任何东西带回清醒世界的。你眼前的这一切都是想象出来的。想法、概念、幻象。难道你能把脑子里的想法握在手里吗？”\n"
"伦道夫插嘴道：“幻梦境里有一个地方，或许有你想要的证据。我在我的梦里见过那个地方。我到过那里三次，每一次都只待了一瞬，马上就被升起的太阳唤醒了……但不论我怎么努力，我都找不到去那儿的路。我已经花了好多个夜晚来寻找。”\n"
"“噢？”维吉尔好奇地问道，“那又是什么地方？”\n"
"“那是一座奇妙的城市，”他双眼发亮，描述道，“那里金碧辉煌，令人心驰神往，不同于我以往见过的每个地方。它位于不为人知的卡达斯山脉的顶峰之上，从未有人踏足。那里坐落著一座属于诸神的缟玛瑙城堡，它隐藏在重重云雾之中，万千星辰为它加冕。”\n"
"维吉尔沉醉在伦道夫的讲述中，一边漫不经心地抚摸著桌上靠近自己的猫咪。那是一只苗条的猫咪，一身黑毛油光水滑，黑如宇宙虚空。“那么我们必须找到那个地方！就算那里没有我们要找的证据，这听起来就像一场此生不再有的冒险。这足够我写上一百页，甚至更多！”\n"
"你对维吉尔与伦道夫说，你得回到清醒世界把你的经历告诉同伴们，才能加入这场冒险。就在这时，响起了另一道神秘而安静的声音：“噢，你无法醒来。那只眼睛正盯著你。”\n"
"你和其他二人转头到处看，寻找著声音的来源。是酒馆老板吗？还是别的客人？维吉尔的黑猫舒展身子，坐了起来，它那敏锐的黄色眼睛就像是窗外的阳光。“我等你们寻找卡达斯等了很久。”它说道。\n"
"“你会说话？”维吉尔惊讶地说道，吓得跳了起来，差点从高脚凳摔了下去。\n"
"“你这呆子，我是猫，当然会说话，”黑猫一边无聊地舔著爪子，一边答道，“你都见过上千只乌撒的猫了，怎么现在才吃惊？”\n"
"“但……我以为……”维吉尔用手掌擦了擦自己的额头。\n"
"“别管他了。”黑猫直接对你说，“我向你保证，你找到了卡达斯之后才能回到清醒世界。那是你唯一的出路。在这期间，我会回到清醒世界，并将你要寻找卡达斯的事情告诉你的同伴。”它跳下桌面，信心满满地朝大门走去。“但我想他们的任务会更艰巨……”"
