msgid "You circle a sullen hill shrouded in darkness and steeped in fog that seems to swallow all sound. You don’t know what rests within the hill, but it feels older than this world, and it seems like it is watching you. You dare not turn to face the barrow, yet you know you cannot leave it, so instead you endlessly patrol it. In the surrounding hedgerows, you catch glimpses of twisted shadows darting to and fro, but whenever you turn your torch upon them, they vanish. You begin to run but are frozen by a loud knock from behind you. When you turn, the fog parts, and you finally see the base of the hill, where a heavy door of weathered slate calls to you."

You push all of your chips into the center and reveal your king-high straight. “What a shame.” He tsks, revealing a pair of twos. “It appears you have lost everything.” You protest, pointing to your superior hand, but when you examine it again, it has changed. The figures on the face cards are now monstrous shapes with no eyes, many mouths, and tentacled arms. “9♥-10♣-D♦-C♠-N[auto_fail],” the cards read.

With each step you take, the flora along the path atrophy, following no laws of nature. Flowers once bloomed in your wake; now they shrivel as you pass. Vines wither and die. The wisps mock you for your ignorance, yet you do not slow your pace. As you look upon the fair trees, their leaves begin to fall. The once-green grass is dry, brown, and cracked. But even should the whole forest die, it will be worth reaching the other side. When you do, the trail ends abruptly at an ornate wooden door carved into the trunk of a great redwood."

Given the appearance of the exterior, the train’s interior is full of unexpected luxury and affluence: Persian rugs hang as decoration, marble staircases wind to dizzying heights, and a crystal chandelier speckles the room with prismatic brilliance.

All of this—the cold casket, the mourning friends and family—it is all because of you. But when you open the casket, there is no body inside: only a long stone passageway leading deep underground. Suddenly, one of the mourners pushes you forward, and you fall over the edge of the casket and down into the pit below, landing painfully on your side.

The dim halls smell of musty pages and melting wax. Taking one of the thick tomes from a nearby shelf, you begin to read. Although you cannot seem to read any of the words, you are utterly absorbed by the tale the pages weave. Your surroundings fade into triviality as time passes. Nothing matters but the shapes of the crimson ink; all else is meaningless in the face of such stark truths. All around you, the library burns to its foundations.

You peer over the rim of the trench and into no-man’s-land, a barren waste of broken, charred countryside where death is certain. And there, you see it: a lone wooden door standing among the rubble and dirt. You know it is your only way out. Gripping your rifle tight, you go over the top and run headlong into a hail of deadly bullets, explosions rocking the ground around you."

With each step, your feet sink deeper into the soft muck, threatening to pull you under. You feel something slick and cold glide across your leg, and you lunge toward dry land—but the more you struggle, the farther you sink. In the blink of an eye, you are consumed whole by the mire, yet you are still falling ever downward. Eventually, you are deposited onto a stone floor along with a small mudslide. You find yourself in a sealed chamber, lit by the paleblue glimmering of strange hieroglyphs. The symbols frame an intricate golden door: the door to the crypt you’ve been searching for."

You don’t recognize your family…the plants in the back yard are arranged differently…and the sky is a patchwork of rotting corpses, raining dismembered body parts onto the landscape. Your not-family watches this precipitation of corpses calmly, discussing the weather it as if it were a banal occurrence. This continues even as the intermittent thudding of hands and feet onto your roof intensifies into a torrent of maimed torsos that causes the ceiling to sag. You run outside, weaving through the deadly rain, and head instinctively toward the edge of your parents’ property. As you hear the crash of the house collapsing behind you, you push away the fallen limbs piling atop an old, familiar spot and are relieved to find the weathered wood of a cellar door."

Exhausted, you manage to rise to your feet, brushing off the dirt caked on your clothing. “You’re lucky you weren’t harmed before we arrived,” a human voice calls out to you. It belongs to a blond-haired man in a brown traveling coat, who leans against a nearby tree. “These woods are not forgiving to the faint of heart.” The scarred cat walks to the man’s side, and the man leans over to pet its back.\n"

The rest of the cats, tribute in mouth, take a protective circular formation around you, and together you escape from the eaves of the enchanted forest."

"这些生物互相叽叽喳喳叫著，过了一会，它们中的好几十只朝著道路对面的大树逃走了。不久它们又再回来，嘴里叼著各种松鸡、鹌鹑、野鸡。你几乎可以肯定，你疯了。然而，这怪异的景象还在继续。它们胆怯地将自己的鸟类“贡品”放在猫群前，然后安静地离开。“我为祖格鼠所作的事向你道歉。”男子走近并说道，“它们是一种好奇的生物，通常不会那么……激动。还好我们及时出现。”猫群的头领从一棵树桩跳下，点头说：“对，没错。可恶的祖格鼠既已进贡，现在该吾等动身，离开这个鬼地方。诸位怎么说？”\n"
"你无法按捺自己的激动。祖格鼠、会说话的猫——你在文章里读到的一切都是真的。你开始询问那名男子，问他更多关于这个世界的事情，但他打断了你：“我会在适当的时候解释的。现在，我们得循著道路前往乌撒之城。相对来说，那里很安全。到了那里你可以好好歇息，从旅行中恢复过来。”他转向那只带有伤疤的老猫，用一种奇怪的语言说了一句话——你怀疑那是某种密码——而那只猫迅速地点了一下头作为回应。其他的猫嘴里叼著贡品，在你周围站成一圈以保护你，然后带你一起逃出了这片被施了魔法的森林。"

"You hold a hand up to the new visitors, believing that you can defuse this situation on your own. Had you known these rodent-like creatures were intelligent all along, you might have tried to communicate with them much earlier. You inform them that you are just travelers in this faraway land and that you simply wish to pass through peacefully. The creatures chitter among themselves for a moment: “They are kind!” “They are not with the black cat after all!” “Summon the Council of Sages!” After a short while, several more of them appear, each with withering grey fur and a frail, thin body. The eldest one peeks behind you and states that they will aid you if you get the cats to leave.\n"
"Somehow, you contain your disbelief and politely ask the cats to come back another time. “All right,” the scarred cat replies, “but you ain’t seen the last of us.” The cats retreat to the edge of the woods, though their human companion stays behind with you. Once the cats are out of earshot, one of the elders offers you a gourd of what appears to be fermented tree sap, which you accept graciously.\n"
"“It is the wine of the moon-tree,” the man behind you explains quietly, stepping forward. “The Zoogs do not give such gifts lightly. They are curious creatures, but not without wisdom. Now that you may speak freely with their elders, try asking them a question. They know more of the dealings of this land than you might think.”\n"
"You describe the author Virgil Gray and ask the Zoogs if they have seen a man fitting that description pass through these woods. You add that he would have walked this path many times. A hush falls over the Zoogs, and some of them immediately depart into the deep foliage. “We have met this human,” one of the elders replies with a flutter just louder than a whisper. “He often comes this way. He is kind but foolish. Take the road to Ulthar. You may meet him.” Then it adds with a low growl: “…but beware the cat that follows him. All cats are liars, but the black cat especially.” You thank the ancient Zoog for its wisdom and depart, led by the blond man and his feline escort. The cats eye you suspiciously after your discussion with the Zoogs. The man breaks the tension. “If you are heading to Ulthar to find this friend of yours, allow me to guide you there. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your travels.”\n"
"Zoogs. Talking cats. This can’t all be a figment of your imagination. Somehow, you can see a layer of truth beneath all of this absurdity. For better or for worse, the Zoog council has confirmed the reality of your situation: the Dreamlands are real, and Virgil Gray is here."

"你相信单凭自己就能化解眼前的局面，举手示意来客不要介入。如果你早知道这些啮齿类动物一直以来都很聪明，你或许会早些尝试与它们交流。你告诉它们，你是从遥远的地方来的旅行者，你只是想通过这里，不想引起任何矛盾。它们叽叽喳喳地聊了一会：“他们没有恶意！”“看来他们和黑猫不是一伙的！“召唤贤者议会！”过了一会，又出现了几只老鼠，它们身体瘦弱，长著干枯的灰色毛发。最年迈的老鼠偷偷看向你身后，说如果你能把猫弄走，它们就会帮助你。\n"
"不知怎的，尽管你满腹疑窦，还是礼貌地请猫下次再来。“好吧。”带有伤疤的猫答道，“但今次不会是我们最后一次见面。”猫群朝著森林边缘撤退，但它们的人类同伴还留在你身后。等猫群听不到这里的声音，其中一只老鼠长者递给你一个葫芦，里面盛的像是发酵的树汁，你欣然收下。\n"
"“这是用月之树酿成的酒。”你身后的男子朝前走了一步，悄声解释道，“祖格鼠不会轻易送出这样贵重的礼物。它们是好奇的生物，但并不愚蠢。现在你可以和它们的长者尽情畅谈了，试著问问它们问题吧。它们可比你想象中更了解这片土地的事情呢。”\n"
"你描述那位作家维吉尔·格雷的样貌，并问祖格鼠有没有看到他从树林里经过。你补充说，那名男子曾多次走过这条路。鼠群一片寂静，随后一些老鼠立即逃进了茂密的树叶之中。“我们见过你说的这个人。”其中一只老鼠长者话音颤抖，用只比耳语大声一点点的声音说道。“他常常从这条路来。他人不错，就是有点傻。往乌撒之城去，你或许能遇上他。”然后它低声咆哮著加了一句：“……但要当心那只跟著他的猫。所有的猫都是骗子，但黑猫尤其狡诈。”你感谢远古祖格鼠为你指点迷津，然后便在金发男子和他的猫咪护送之下离开。你和祖格鼠交谈过后，猫群狐疑地看著你。男子开口打破了这股紧张感：“要是你想去乌撒找你那位朋友，请允许我带你到那儿去吧。相对来说，那里很安全。到了那里你可以好好歇息，从旅行中恢复过来。”\n"
"祖格鼠。会说话的猫。这不可能全是你想象出来的。不知道为什么，你知道真相就在这怪诞场景背后。不论如何，你已经从祖格鼠贤者议会那里确认了你如今的情况：幻梦境是真实存在的，而维吉尔·格雷也在这里。"
