Your mind teems with anxiety over the quest looming ahead. You reflect on the black cat’s warning about danger in the waking world, and you wonder about the others who have followed Virgil Gray down the steps of slumber and through the Enchanted Woods. Are they here now, too? Perhaps if you find this castle and return with proof of the Dreamlands, you can save everyone: yourself, your friends, and the other dreamers as well."

"When day breaks and light peeks through the curtains of your room, you notice a cat-shaped silhouette sitting in front of the window. As your vision adjusts, you are transfixed by its piercing yellow eyes, bright as the dawn light. You recognize the shape as Virgil’s talking cat. You ask the black cat how long it has been sitting there.\n"
"“Long enough to know you are neither waking nor asleep,” it replies paradoxically.\n"
"The nature of this world still confounds you. Can one even sleep in the Dreamlands? If so, where would their minds go? Curious, you pose this question to the cat.\n"
"“Those here in their physical bodies can, but you are something else entirely. Now, never mind all that. On to business.” The black cat leaps onto your bed. “I gave your friends the warning you wanted me to pass along. They are preparing to enter the Dreamlands as well, it seems. In the meantime, I will stay with you. Somebody has to watch over you and my pet human, anyway.”"

"当清晨的第一缕阳光穿过你房间的窗帘，你隐约看见窗前有一只猫的影子。你揉揉眼睛，定定地看著它那双锐利的、像晨光一般明亮的黄色猫眼，移不开视线。你想起来这是维吉尔那只会说话的猫。你问它在这儿坐了多久，它回答道：\n"
"“久到能知道你现在没睡著也没睡醒。”它所说的话有些自相矛盾。\n"
"你仍对这个世界感到困惑。有人在幻梦境睡著过吗？如果有的话，他们的意识会到哪去？你好奇地向黑猫提出这个问题。\n"
"“带著肉体里来的人才能入睡，而你完全不是。现在别想那些了，来说正事。”黑猫跳到你的床上，“我把你的口信带给了你的朋友们，提醒了他们。似乎他们现在也准备进入幻梦境。在这期间，我会待在你身边。毕竟总得有人照看你和我的宠物人类。”"

"In the morning, you find Virgil and Randolph talking in the town square outside of Einar’s Place. You still aren’t quite sure what to think of either of them, but you have a good sense of where you should go next. After all, this is not your first excursion into the fabled land of dreams. Addressing Randolph, you suggest talking to the high priest Atal in the nearby Temple of the Elder Ones. It is a name you heard the last time you visited the city of Ulthar in your sleep, though until now you had no reason to seek the priest’s advice. Randolph gives you a startled glance that transforms quickly into a smirk.\n"
"“How curious,” he says, “I was about to suggest the same. Atal is wise beyond all our measure. He may know where to find the place we seek.”\n"
"Virgil, eager to embark on this adventure, claps his hands. “Well, what are we waiting for? This way, my friends!”\n"

Though you aren’t quite sure what to think of either of them just yet, you know that both of them are well versed in the lay of this strange land. You ask them about your next move. “We should speak to the high priest Atal in the Temple of the Elder Ones,” Randolph suggests. “He is wise beyond all our measure and may know where to find the place we seek.” You wonder aloud how far the temple is from here.\n"
"“Not far at all,” Randolph replies. “It stands atop the highest hill within Ulthar. Come, I will lead the way.” With Randolph taking the lead, you make your way to the Temple of the Elder Ones, a circular tower of ivoried stone protected by a small army of cats.

"“一点也不远。”伦道夫回答说，“它就在乌撒之城最高的山上。来吧，我来带路。”伦道夫带著你来到一座圆形的象牙石塔前，这里就是旧神的庙宇，而且有一小群猫咪拦在你们面前。为首的猫咪正是你在树林里遇到的那只带著伤疤的老猫。它上前阻止你进入神庙，并对你们一行人讥讽道：“又见面了。”老猫尖声说道，“我猜汝等想叫我行个方便。"

"“Well, too bad,” the cat says, tail stiff and straight. More cats flank you from the sides, several hissing loudly. Their fur puffs up, and their eyes flare with anger. “It’s our duty to guard this place from impetuous outsiders like yerself. Yeh ain’t wanted here.”\n"

msgid "You tell the cat that you are merely here to speak with Atal, and that you mean no harm. “Ah, no worries, human,” the cat says with a gaping yawn—the kind only a cat can perform and still look regal in the act. “You don’t seem the type to make trouble. ’Sides, I ain’t goin’ nowhere.” You see a small lump in front of the cat: a bloodied, half-eaten pheasant. You resist the urge to turn up your nose and count yourself lucky you are on this cat’s good side. “Go on in,” he says, then licks his chops as he prepares to finish his meal."
msgstr "你告诉老猫，你到这只想跟阿塔尔谈谈，并没有任何恶意。“啊，别担心，人类。”猫打著哈欠说道——这个动作只有猫才能做到，并且这么做的时候依然看起来十分高贵。“你看起来不像是会惹麻烦的类型。况且，这里还有我镇守呢。”你看到猫的面前有一小块东西，那是被吃了一半的血淋淋的野鸡。你强忍著露出厌恶表情的冲动，庆幸自己与这只猫处好了关系，“进去吧。”它说完舔舔嘴巴，准备吃完这顿美餐。"

msgid "Resigned, you leave the temple on the hilltop behind. “I suppose we shall have to make do without Atal’s wisdom,” Randolph says with a sigh. “In any event, it is likely our destination is far from here—perhaps on another continent altogether. We will need to secure passage by sea. I suggest we travel south, to the port city of Dylath-Leen. We can figure out our next step from there.” You nod and take one last look at the stone temple, wondering at the knowledge you may have left behind."
msgstr "你们放弃之后，离开了这座山顶上的神庙。“我想，没有阿塔尔的智慧，我们只能将就著往下调查了。”伦道夫说著叹了口气，“无论如何，我们的目的地可能离这里很远——或许完全在另一块大陆上。我们走海路可以确保通畅。我提议，我们往南边去，到狄拉斯-利恩港口城。在那里我们会知道下一步该怎么做。”你点头，然后最后看了一眼那座石塔神庙，好奇你遗漏了什么信息。"

msgid "You inform the cat you are entering the temple one way or another, and that a simple cat will not stand in your way. “Wanna bet?” he growls, lowering his body and preparing to pounce. Noticing the commotion, several cats guarding the temple surround you. You don’t wish to harm these cats, but you won’t let them block you from your objective, either. Nodding to your companions, you make a mad dash for the temple gates. A storm of hisses and angry screeches erupts all around you as the cats mount a desperate defense. A wall of tiny claws and teeth meets you, but you push through, defiant. You slam the stone door shut behind you and hear the old cat yelling from the other side: “Fine then, human! See your priest! But do not think this transgression will be forgiven!”"
msgstr "你告诉老猫，你无论如何都要进神庙，区区一只猫拦不住你。“你想跟我打个赌吗？”他咆哮道，伏下身子，准备猛扑。还有几只猫注意到这一幕，包围了你。你不想伤害这些猫，但你也不会让它们阻拦你。你向同伴点点头，然后迅速冲向神庙大门。你的四面八方爆发出如同狂风般的一阵咆哮声和愤怒的尖叫声，猫群不顾一切地阻拦你。无数的小爪子和尖牙在面前阻拦著你，但你无所畏惧地强行穿过。你砰地一声关上身后的石门，听见老猫在门的另一边大叫：“好啊，人类！见你的牧师去吧！但你别以为刚才你犯的罪行能得到宽恕！”"

"At the top of the temple, seated on an ivory dais, the high priest Atal awaits you. He is a frail, wiry man with a long, wispy black beard, caved-in cheeks, and the pale, milky eyes of one afflicted by blindness. “Do not let your eyes deceive you,” Randolph whispers as you seat yourselves in front of the dais. “Atal is over three centuries old, but his memory is sharp as a tack.”\n"
"You ask the priest about your quest and about your destination: the castle Randolph described from his dreams. “You speak of the resting place of the Great Ones, high above unknown Kadath. Even I know not its true location. And that is all well and good, for the fruits of attempting to ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard from again. The gods of Kadath may seem powerless, but they are protected by the Other Gods from the Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. It would be wiser to let all the gods alone and leave this folly behind.”\n"
"Atal’s use of the word “gods” has you curious. You wonder aloud what kind of god might exist in a place like this.\n"
"The priest shakes his head. “They are not our gods, but the gods of Earth, for this land is but a reflection of yours.”\n"
"You attempt to pry deeper into Atal’s wisdom with your questioning, but his advice does not budge. “I have already said more than I should,” he insists. “Please, for your sake, pursue this madness no further.”"

"你向牧师询问关于你们的任务和目的地：伦道夫所说的他梦中的那座城堡，“你所说的是梦境诸神的歇息地，就在未知的卡达斯上方高空。即便是我，也不知道它确切的位置。不知道也好，因为试图到那个地方去的后果会很痛苦。我的同伴巴尔塞曾经登上一座有些神圣的山峰，从此渺无音讯。卡达斯的神明看似没有任何力量，但它们受外神保护，而最好不要议论外神。不去管那些神明，不去管这件蠢事比较好。”\n"
"阿塔尔提到的“神”使你感到好奇。你问什么样的神会在这样的地方。\n"
"牧师摇摇头：“它们不是我们的神，而是地球诸神，它们庇佑这个地方，但不是你们内心的缩影。”\n"

You pretend to partake of the wine yourself while offering draught after draught to the priest. Eventually, Atal’s lips loosen, and he speaks of forbidden things he would never discuss were it not for the wine. He tells of an image carved into the face of the mountain Ngranek on the isle of Oriab—the likeness of the gods, or so he claims. He tells of the pillars of Kadatheron wherein the history of Earth’s Dreamlands is recorded. He tells of those slain by the hordes of Night itself and interred in the crypts of Zulan-Thek, the city of the dead. He tells of a baleful star above a forgotten city that appears on no map. “If you absolutely must seek Kadath in the Cold Wastes,” he says drowsily, “there is a city along the coast to the south: Dylath-Leen. You may secure passage there.”"
msgstr "你突然灵光一闪，想起祖格鼠在魔幻森林里给你的月树酒。你倒了一些给阿塔尔，他落落大方地接受了。你给牧师一杯接一杯地倒酒，而你只是假装喝下。最后，阿塔尔松了口，他说起一些酒后才能吐露的禁忌之言。他说起奥瑞巴岛上的恩格拉尼克山脉，那里雕刻著一张面孔——是神的肖像，至少他是这么说的。他还说到了卡达瑟隆的柱子，那里记录著地球幻梦境的历史。他说到那些被夜色怪群屠杀，安葬在死亡之城祖兰-提克的地穴。他还说，有个不存在于地图上的、被遗忘的城市，那里上方有著一颗凶星。“如果你一定要在冰封荒土中寻找卡达斯。”他昏昏沉沉地说，“南边沿海地区有一座城市：狄拉斯-利恩。你可以在那找到入口。”"

msgid "You wake to find yourself restrained by thick cords of hempen rope, lying on top of hard, moist wood. The floor rocks steadily back and forth, and you hear ocean waves crashing against the walls. You are captive aboard some kind of galley. But why?"
msgstr "你醒来时发现自己躺在坚硬而潮湿的木板上，被粗麻绳捆著。地面稳定地前后晃动，你可以听到海浪冲击墙壁的声音。你被抓到了某艘船上。但为什么会抓你呢？"

"You have ventured far and wide, from the quaint cobbled villages of the kingdom of the Skai to wondrous lands you could have never in a hundred years imagined. You learned much of the Dreamlands and of the gods who dwell atop unknown Kadath. Though you are closer to your goal, you still don’t know its precise location. In the meantime, your quest grows deadlier with each passing day. No matter where you go, foul, nightmarish creatures pursue you across land and sea. Winged beasts with no faces, horned Corsairs wielding razor-sharp cutlasses and commanding great black galleys—the agents of your demise bear many shapes. You decide to return to your ship, safe from the many dangers of the Dreamlands…or so you thought. Unfortunately, your ship is no safe haven. When you return, the crew and captain are nowhere to be found. There are no signs of struggle, but Virgil, who returned to the ship earlier to prepare for your next departure, is also missing.\n"
"“I fear the worst,” Randolph mourns. “If those fiendish Corsairs captured them, they are in dire trouble. They are agents of the Other Gods from the Outside, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos <smallcaps>Nyarlathotep</smallcaps>.” The mere utterance of the name causes you to shudder, though you do not know why. You ask where they might have been taken. As if discussing any other port of call, he replies: “The beasts who command their black galleys sail from the Moon. If we are to rescue Virgil and our other companions, that is where we must go.”"

"你的冒险已经来到了非常遥远的地方，从斯凯王国古雅的鹅卵石村庄，到你毕生也无法想象的惊奇大陆。你知道了关于幻梦境的许多信息，以及居住在未知的卡达斯上方的神明。尽管你接近了自己的目标，但你依然不知道它具体的位置。与此同时，你的冒险之旅每过一天，都变得更加危险。无论你去到哪里，令人作呕的噩梦般的生物都在追著你，跨越山海。长有翅膀的无面野兽追猎著你，还有挥舞著锋利短剑的长角海盗，开著巨大的黑色海盗船在海上紧追著你——你的死神真是千变万化。你决定回到自己的船上，躲避幻梦境的危机……至少你是这么想的。但很遗憾，你的船上并不安全。你回到船上时，船员和船长已不见踪影。现场没有挣扎的痕迹，但较早回到船上为下次航程做准备的维吉尔也不见了。\n"
"“恐怕他们已经……”伦道夫为他们哀悼，“如果那些邪恶的海盗抓了他们，那他们凶多吉少。那些海盗是外神的使徒，其真身与信使是蠕行混沌——<b>奈亚拉托提普</b>。”你一听到这个名字就莫名地发抖。你问他们可能会被带到什么地方去。他就像讨论寻常海港一样回答你：“那群海盗的海船是从月球启航的。如果我们想救回维吉尔和其他同伴，那我们必须到那儿去。”"

msgid "As you examine your surroundings, you notice that your other companions, including Virgil and Randolph, have been captured as well. They are unconscious at the moment, but maybe when they awaken you can formulate a plan to free yourselves. After all, despite this setback, you have learned much of the Dreamlands and of the gods who dwell atop unknown Kadath. Though you still don’t know its precise location, if you are able to escape from this wretched galley, perhaps there is hope for your quest. You swallow a ball of despair and hope that this is not the end of your journey…"
msgstr "你查看周遭时，发现包括维吉尔和伦道夫在内的其他同伴也被抓来了。他们此时都已昏迷，或许等他们醒来，你们可以一起想出自救的对策。尽管遭受了挫折，但你们已经知道了关于幻梦境的许多信息，以及居住在未知的卡达斯上方的神明。但你仍然不知道卡达斯具体的位置，如果你能从这艘可恶的海盗船逃出去，或许就能找到此行的希望。你强忍著内心的绝望，祈望你的旅程不会到此为止……"
