"It takes many hours for your steeds to reach their destination. You dare not try to wriggle free, for the fall would surely kill you. Besides, this may be your only chance to find Kadath. The creatures pass under archways of woven shadow, over cerulean seas that glimmer in the moonlight, and through vast swaths of dense mist. Eventually, you reach a continent far to the north, where even your intrepid captain never ventured. Colossal creatures dwell in the deep, dark ocean—a terrible danger to any ship that dares the dreadful seas.\n"
"Your steeds fly over a desolate landscape of ice and snow before landing. In the distance, through a haze of snow, you barely make out the shape of a domed building. One of the winged creatures points in the direction of the foreboding ruin, silently commanding you to proceed. The rest stand silently behind you with perfect patience, guarding against your escape, though you have no intention of fleeing. You will find and scale the peaks of unknown Kadath, or you will die trying."

"驮著你们的生物花了好几个小时才到达目的地。你不敢挣扎，因为掉下去必死无疑。而且，这趟旅程或许是你唯一能找到卡达斯的机会了。它们飞过月光下闪烁的蔚蓝海洋，穿过大片浓雾，飞入暗影交织而成的拱门。终于，你来到了北方遥远的大陆，即便是你无畏的船长也未曾到过这里。栖居在黑暗深海中的生物，对于驶进可怕海域的任何船只来说都是恐怖的危险。\n"
"你的坐骑飞过一片冰天雪地的荒凉之地后著陆。你透过迷蒙的雪花远远望去，看到了一些几乎无法看清轮廓的圆顶建筑。一只有翼生物指著不详的废墟，静静地命令你朝那个地方前进。它的同胞们都静默无声地站在你身后，耐心地防备著你逃跑，尽管你无意逃走。你将找到不为人知的卡达斯，攀登上它的山峰，或者在寻找的过程中失去自己的生命。"

"The White Ship sails effortlessly through the aether. Along the way, it passes under archways of woven shadow, over cerulean seas that glimmer in the moonlight, and through vast swaths of dense mist. Eventually, you reach a continent far to the north, where even your intrepid captain never ventured. Colossal creatures dwell in the deep, dark ocean—a terrible danger to any ship that dares the dreadful seas. The captain moors the flying ship over a desolate landscape of ice and snow. Several moonbeams emerge from the ship’s white hull, forming a gangway to the tundra below. In the distance, through a haze of snowflakes, you can barely make out the shape of a domed building. “Welcome to the accursed Plateau of Leng,” the elderly captain says with a hint of regret in his voice. “You will find no joy or peace here. Only death. Please, I must implore you once more to forsake this quest and return to fairer lands. Are you sure this is where you would like to disembark?”\n"
"You nod. The captain sighs in reply. “I see. The White Ship shall sail no more to this forsaken place, for it shakes me to my core. You are on your own from here. I bid you farewell and good luck, fellow traveler.” You cross over bright, vivid moonbeams down onto the bleak expanse below. You will find and scale the peaks of unknown Kadath, or you will die trying."

"白船轻松地在太空中行驶。一路上，白船飞过月光下闪烁的蔚蓝海洋，穿过大片浓雾，飞入暗影交织而成的拱门。终于，你来到了北方遥远的大陆，即便是你无畏的船长也未曾到过这里。栖居在黑暗深海中的生物，对敢于驶进可怕海域的任何船只来说都是恐怖的危险。船只飞过一片冰天雪地的荒凉之地后，船长便将船只泊岸。白色船身透出几道月光，形成了通往下方冻土的舷梯。你透过迷蒙的雪花远远望去，看到了一些几乎无法看清轮廓的圆顶建筑。“欢迎来到被诅咒的冷原。”年迈的船长惋惜地说道，“在这里，你不会获得欢愉和平静。只会迎来死亡。我必须再次恳请你放弃探寻卡达斯，回到更好的地方去。你确定要在这里下船吗？”\n"
"你点点头。船长叹气道：“我明白了。这片荒土使我内心动摇，因此我再也不会将白船驶来这里。接下来，你得靠自己了。我们在此道别吧，祝你好运，同渡人。”你穿过明亮的月光，来到下方荒凉的冻土。你将找到不为人知的卡达斯，攀登上它的山峰，或者在寻找的过程中失去自己的生命。"

"Higher and higher, you scale the mountains far to the north. Pale light shines from atop a great black peak piercing the vibrant firmament, and you know that you approach the end of your quest. You spend untold hours ascending the snow-covered slopes until finally you reach the forbidden steps leading to the castle’s great hall. The castle stands astride a precipice that overlooks the entire continent and the ocean beyond. It is a majestic sight. Above, countless tenebrous towers loom, swathed in a vortex of snow and hail. You break a trail through the crusted snow before the castle, and it soon gives way to smooth, polished onyx. The biting wind quiets to a whistle. You are bathed in a prodigious darkness that fills the vast space. Soon there is nothing but the echoing of your footsteps on the onyx floor and the quiet, lonely stillness of the great hall. Though you have crossed no doorway, you realize now where you stand: inside the halls of the Great Ones. You expected to be met by guards, servants of the gods, or perhaps even those powerful beings themselves, but you are met only by loneliness and foreboding as chilling as the piercing winds outside. You continue forward until at last you reach the end of the hall. Here, flanked by smooth onyx pillars, you find…nothing.\n"

"你攀登遥远北方的山脉，越爬越高。一座巨大的黑色山峰上方，一道白光穿透了瞬息万变的天穹，你知道你的探寻之旅走到了尽头。你登上白雪皑皑的山坡，花了数之不尽的时间，终于来到了通往城堡大礼堂的禁忌阶梯。这座城堡伫立在悬崖峭壁之上，俯瞰整片大陆和遥远的海洋。这派景象何等的宏伟。上方隐约可见无数黑暗的高塔，它们处在冰雪和冰雹的漩涡中心。你踏在积雪上，往城堡走去，很快脚下就变成了光滑锃亮的黑玛瑙。刺骨寒风的尖啸逐渐淡去。你被充斥广阔空间的无边黑暗所包围。很快，除了你踏在缟玛瑙地面上的回声，只剩大礼堂的安静、寂寥。虽然你并未穿过门径，但你知道你现在位于哪里：梦境诸神的大礼堂。你本以为会碰见守卫或神仆，或许还能直接见到那些强大的神明，但你只感到孤独与不祥，就像城堡以外的刺骨寒风。你继续前行，最终你走到了大厅的尽头。这里两旁是光滑的缟玛瑙石柱，你……一无所获。\n"
"这里并没有神明存在，而且早已荒弃。\n"

"You turn to Randolph for answers. He has been your guide through all of this madness. Surely he will know what is going on. “Finally,” he says, gazing upon the hall with wide eyes. “We have reached the halls of the Great Ones, upon whom it is unlawful for mortals to look. We knew it was forbidden, yet here we are, our quest complete.” He turns to Virgil. “Was it worth it, sir? Have you found the evidence you seek?”\n"
"Virgil takes a step back. “What are you on about, Randolph? Was this not your idea? You are the one who led us on this quest to begin with.”\n"
"Randolph smiles and places a hand on Virgil’s shoulder. “Yes, I am. But I am not Randolph Carter.” He pulls back his other arm and, before you can react, drives a razor-sharp blade of onyx through Virgil Gray’s chest. Virgil’s corpse slides to the polished floor, eyes forever frozen in tragic shock. The being that was never Randolph Carter turns toward you, its shadow shifting into myriad shapes as it stretches across the ground. “Behold!” its many voices growl. “Your just reward!”"

"你转向伦道夫寻求答案。他在这一路的疯狂之旅中充当你的向导。显然他清楚这是怎么一回事。“终于。”他一边说，一边瞪大了眼睛看著眼前的殿堂。“我们来到了凡人不可窥探的诸神的殿堂。我们知道这里是禁忌之地，却还是来到了这里，我们的探寻之旅成功了。”他转向维吉尔，“您满意了吗？你找到你要的证据了吗？”\n"
"维吉尔退后道：“伦道夫，你在说什么？不是你提议要来的吗？一开始是你提议我们启程探寻这里的。\n"
"伦道夫笑笑，一手放在维吉尔的肩头：“是的，是我提议的。但我不是伦道夫·卡特。”你还没来得及反应，他的另一只手收回身侧，掏出一柄缟玛瑙利剑刺进了维吉尔·格雷的胸膛。维吉尔尸身徐徐滑落，躺在了光滑的地面上，悲痛而震惊的眼神也陷入定格。自始至终都并非伦道夫·卡特的那个存在转向你，它的影子在地面上迅速变换为万千形态。“看吧！”它以各种声音咆哮道，“此乃汝等之奖赏！”"

"Just then, a voice behind you breaks the silence, punctuating your confusion. “Virgil Gray. You have come to see the Great Ones, upon whom it is unlawful for mortals to look.” The voice belongs to a tall, thin figure bedecked in the ornate prismatic robes of an ancient pharaoh, crowned with a golden pschent that glows faintly in the darkness. “What is it you expected to find?”\n"
"“Are you one of the gods who dwells in this castle?” Virgil asks, approaching the being. “Why is this place so dark and lonely?”\n"
"The regal figure permits an unhappy expression to flicker briefly over its countenance. “The gods you seek have fled their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in another land, a land so marvelous they have forgotten how to be gods. Will you help me right this wrong?” the figure asks. Before Virgil can reply, it pulls its arm back and drives a razorsharp blade of onyx through Virgil’s chest. His corpse slides to the polished floor, eyes forever frozen in tragic shock. The figure turns toward you, its shadow shifting into myriad shapes as it stretches across the ground. “No,” its many voices growl. “It is not enough.”"

"就在这时，你身后的一道声音打破了沉寂，也打断了你的困惑：“维吉尔·格雷。你已经来到了这里，来见凡人不可窥探的梦境诸神。”这道声音来自一个高大瘦削的人，他身著古代法老的华丽而多彩的长袍，头戴一顶金色双重冠，帽冠在黑暗中微微发亮。“你想要找到什么？”\n"
"“你是居住在这座城堡的神明之一吗？”维吉尔接近那人，问道，“这里为什么如此黑暗，如此孤寂？”\n"
"那位打扮尊贵的男子脸上闪过一丝不快：“你所寻找的神明已经离开了卡达斯的城堡，移居到别的地方，一个令它们忘却了<b>为神之道</b>的奇境。你们愿意帮我复原这一切吗？”那人问道。维吉尔还没回答，那人便掏出一柄缟玛瑙利剑刺进了维吉尔的胸膛。维吉尔尸身徐徐滑落，躺在了光滑的地面上，悲痛而震惊的眼神也陷入定格。那人转向你，它的影子在地面上迅速变换为万千形态。“不。”它以各种声音咆哮道，“这还不够。”"

It speaks to you, even now, as you tremble under the hospital sheets: “Your dreams are mine!”"

msgid "The presence taunting your mind retreats into the shadows, and you are left once again with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. The vast halls of the onyx castle are evidence of nothing but despair and sorrow. Whatever gods once inhabited this place left long ago. Coming here was indeed folly.

The black cat—whatever it truly was—must have seen this in its visions. You carry Virgil’s corpse out into the snowy peaks of Kadath and bury him outside the castle.

Had you ever experienced such wonders in the waking world? Could you really return to such a mundane life after what you have experienced here? Perhaps it would be better to stay. You can escape from this dreaded land of Leng and travel back to safer climes. You can live in the timeless realm of Celephaïs, where pleasures are abundant, and you will never age. Or perhaps live amongst the cats in the pleasant town of Ulthar where your quest began. Or explore the boundaries of the Dreamlands and see all of the marvels that it has to offer. Your mind is made up. You cannot return to the waking world, for you never want to leave."
