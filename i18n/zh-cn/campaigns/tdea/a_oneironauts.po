"You open your eyes to the sound of a cat’s shrill caterwauling. You had been drifting off to…well, not sleep, exactly. Despite—or perhaps due to—your dreaming, you have been unable to truly sleep in this realm. When you come to your senses, you spot the source of the wailing: Virgil’s cat, black as the void of space itself, sits several feet away waiting for you to pay attention. “Finally,” it declares, “about time you noticed something outside your own head. Listen, I got something important to tell you.”"

"<i>接著冒险2-A，入梦者朝未知的领域航行……</i>\n"
"你突然听到猫尖锐的嚎叫声，睁开了眼睛。本来你已经睡著了……但准确来说，不是睡著。尽管——或者说正是因为——你在做梦，你无法在这个世界真正地睡著。当你回过神来，你注意到那声嚎叫的来源：维吉尔的猫，像虚空之地一般黑，它正坐在几英尺外，等著你注意到它。“终于看过来了。”它说，“你也是时候从自己脑袋里醒来，注意一下外界了。听著，我有很重要的事要对你说。”"

msgid "If at least one investigator was not captured:"

"“Wait, where is my human?” the cat asks, craning its head to look around the deck of your ship. “Didn’t I leave him with you?”\n"
"You explain that Virgil has been taken captive by Corsairs, and the cat replies by licking its paw without much concern. “Oh yeah, that’s right. Okay. I’m on the same page as you now.”"

"“等等，我的人类在哪？”黑猫伸长了脖颈环顾你的甲板，问道，“我不是让他跟你在一起吗？”\n"

msgid "If all of the investigators were captured:"
msgstr "如果所有调查员皆已被俘："

msgid "You try to shush the black cat, but it ignores you. “Relax. Your captors are all up on deck at the moment.” You ask bitterly why the creature is so cavalier about your capture, and request that it free you. “Nah. Somebody else has that covered, if memory serves,” it replies enigmatically."
msgstr "你示意黑猫安静，但它无视了你：“别紧张。现在那群海盗都在甲板上呢。”你咬牙切齿地问它为什么对你们被俘一事毫不在乎，要求它放了你。“不。如果没记错的话，会有别人来干这事。”它神秘兮兮地说道。"

msgid "The black cat sees Randolph at the helm of your ship and glares at him suspiciously. You wonder aloud what is wrong. “Normally I like the smell of fish, but this is too fishy. Something is wrong. There are not supposed to be two of him. But my memory is fuzzy…” You thought you were confused before, but now you are truly lost. Two Randolphs? “Yes,” the black cat affirms. “This one, and another in the waking world. That seems off,” the black cat understates the problem. “I think something is trying to interfere. I need to go figure this out.” With that, the cat leaps out of view."
msgstr "黑猫看到伦道夫在你的船上掌舵，怀疑地盯著他。你开口问它有什么不对劲的。“一般来说，我喜欢鱼的味道，但这条鱼太腥了。有点不对劲。不可能有两个他。但我的记忆也变得模糊……”你之前只是有点听不懂它说的话，但这回你是彻底摸不著头脑了。两个伦道夫？“嗯。”黑猫肯定地答道，“这边有一个，清醒世界还有另一个。这很不对劲啊。”黑猫轻描淡写地说道，“我想有人正试图干预。我得查清这事。”说完，黑猫就跳出了你的视野。"

I know your quest is looking pretty dire right now, too, but if I don’t stick by them, it won’t matter whether you reach Kadath or not. Good luck. Try not to die.” With that, the black cat leaps out of view."
msgstr "“你的朋友们遇上了点麻烦。他们踏上了一场有去无回的旅行，到一个十分可怕的地方去，但我不知道没了我他们还能不能到达那里。我知道你现在的任务也很艰巨，但如果我不跟在他们身边，就算你到了卡达斯也没有任何意义。祝你好运。别把命给丢了。”说完，黑猫就跳出了你的视野。"

msgid "“Your friends are doing about as well as can be expected, really. But they’re worried about you, and for good reason, it seems. They might not be able to reach you any time soon. They want me to help you out instead, so I’ll be staying here for a little while longer. Gotta make sure you survive. If you don’t, well…” it takes a long pause, “…let’s not talk about that.”"
msgstr "“你的朋友们做得就像预期的一样好，真的。但他们很担心你，也很难怪他们会这样，毕竟他们可能短时间内无法来帮你。他们想让我代替他们，帮你走出困境，所以我会在这里再待一段时间。我会保护你周全。如果你遭逢不测，唔……”它停顿了很久，“……还是别说这些了。”"

msgid "The black cat tells you all about the region of the Dreamlands your companions have entered. “The entire surface of the Dreamlands, where you’ve been exploring, covers the Underworld like a beautiful silk dress over decayed skin. You have no reason to go there, which is a good thing, because it is a particularly inhospitable place. You actually might have walked right by one entrance to the Underworld, now that I think about it—back in the Enchanted Woods. There are several other entrances as well: beneath an old monastery in Leng, another in the ruins of Sarkomand…”"
msgstr "黑猫告诉你关于你的同伴们进入的幻梦境的一切：“你们一直在探索的幻梦境，就覆盖在地下世界之上，就像一件美丽的丝绸裙子覆盖著腐烂的皮肤。你不用到那里去，这是好事，因为那里尤其不欢迎来客。我想起来，实际上，你或许曾经路过通向地下世界的入口——就在魔幻森林。除此之外，还有几个入口：一个在冷原隐修院下方，另一个在萨尔科曼德的废墟……”"
