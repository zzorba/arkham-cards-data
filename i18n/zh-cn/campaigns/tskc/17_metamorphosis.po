"At first, you are concerned that nobody recognizes Dr. Irawan’s name, but after some persistent questioning, a reluctant local offers to lead you to her. Heading into the dense underbrush, you follow a steep path up a nearby mountain until you reach a dark hollow. Leaning against the trunk of an ironwood tree, you find the zoologist peering intently into the shadows.\n"
"“I did not expect you to follow me here,” Dr. Irawan whispers. Following her lead, you sit down next to her and peer into the dark. The air around you is thick and moist. “My theory was… incorrect. Or at least, partially incorrect.” From your vantage point, you can see into a shallow dell cut by a cascading waterfall. The moon shimmers on the ripples of a narrow stream. Dr. Irawan continues: “All trace of this particular cuscus is gone, that much is for certain. The locals have no memory of them. But something is different about the disappearance. Something lingers.”\n"
"A low, moaning wail from somewhere in the trees startles you. Dr. Irawan holds out a pair of binoculars and points at a cluster of ironwood trees on the far side of the glade. Peering through, you spy three cat-sized marsupials with yellow eyes clinging to a branch, curled tails swinging in the dark. They are feeding on something. Just looking at them makes your head spin: something about them is both there and not there at once, forcing your eyes to constantly adjust. The animals’ movements are stiff and double-jointed as well, both too fast and too slow. You look away.\n"
"“You see them?” asks Dr. Irawan. You nod and look again: the cuscus are messily devouring a green python. “It is fascinating. A fundamental change. The prey have become predators. The few I have observed have made a complete shift in behavior, turning on other cuscus, hunting their own natural predators—of which the green python is one. Their very nature seems to have changed!” Dr. Irawan stammers excitedly. “But more importantly, they aren’t gone. I mean: they have gone, to some. Nobody remembers them. But yet they persist.”\n"
"You turn your binoculars back to the cuscus to find them frozen: staring straight at you with their bright, topaz eyes. Surprised, you drop the binoculars. When you look again, the cuscus are gone. Suddenly on edge, you tell Dr. Irawan it would be best to leave, but she shakes her head. “I am on the verge of the greatest discovery of the century. An entire field of para-zoological research. I cannot leave now.”\n"
"Leaving Dr. Irawan to her own devices, you head back into town. The jungle around you is eerily silent, and even as you break into a moonlit clearing, you cannot help the feeling of being watched.\n"
"Over the next few days, you make contact with the zoologist in passing. The day your ship is scheduled to leave Manokwari, Dr. Irawan is suspiciously absent from the guest house. The staff tell you she didn’t return the night before. Concerned for her safety, you return to the hollow where you met her before. The jungle retains the same unsettling quietude as you hike up the mountain.\n"
"Scattered on a rock overhanging the dark hollow are several torn-up sketchbooks and a broken pair of binoculars, but no trace of Dr. Irawan. Scanning the murky copse, you see a glimmer of light and the zoologist’s batik vest at the base of the waterfall. You carefully pick your way down the muddy slopes to the bank of a narrow stream where the zoologist lays prone, her arm bent at an odd angle. A trio of yellow-eyed cuscus scatter as you approach. Turning her over gently, you are relieved to find her still breathing. A strange black implement is clutched in her left hand, close to her chest.\n"
"A mordant call resounds from above. Dr. Irawan is surprisingly light as you scoop her up in your arms. Dozens of yellow eyes glare down at you from the ironwood trees as you carry the zoologist downstream, away from the hollow. Flitting, shimmering forms dart to and fro overhead like silent warnings.\n"
"As soon as you get back to town, you check the unconscious zoologist into a clinic. The ship you had booked has already left, but with the strange circumstances you found her in, you resolve to stay with Dr. Irawan until she wakes up. Several days pass, filled with disquieting silence, until she finally speaks.\n"
"“I noticed several cuscus gathered around this,” she thumbs the hollow bell in her good hand. “I knew better than to interfere. But they seemed so fixated on it. Much like magpies or crows will hoard certain objects. So strange. I noticed they stowed it in the crook of a branch and, so I climbed up for a better look and—well, that’s when I fell,” she says.\n"
"You hold the strange chime in your hands, appreciating its heft and form. The inlaid designs are like nothing you or the zoologist have ever seen. The metal is cool to the touch yet strangely electric. On a whim, you hold the bell up and swing it once, even though it doesn’t have a clapper. A palpable wave of sonic energy ripples through the air around you. From the trees, you can hear a familiar mournful cry.\n"
"“This has become more than a simple survey,” Dr Irawan whispers. “Whatever those creatures have become, they are no longer Phalanger septimus. Something changed.” The zoologist pauses and considers her words for a moment, then smiles at you. “Whatever is happening, I—I would prefer to not work alone. Perhaps I could continue my research with you?”\n"
"You tell Dr. Irawan you wouldn’t have it any other way, and agree to stay with her as she recovers. The zoologist entrusts the strange bell to you."

"一开始你担心没人认识伊拉万博士，但在你锲而不舍的追问下，一名当地人不情愿的带你去找她。你们走进茂密的灌木林中，沿著陡峭的小路上山，直到一个黑暗的洞穴旁。伊拉万博士就靠在附近的铁树树干上，注视著阴影之中。\n"
"“我没想到你会跟到这里来。”伊拉万博士低声说。你照著她的指示，在她身边坐下，也开始试著注视黑暗中的东西。周遭的空气闷热而潮湿。“我的理论……不太正确。至少在某些方面不完全正确。”从这个视野良好的位置，你可以看到一个瀑布支流形成的浅谷地，月光反射在小溪的水面上闪闪发亮。伊拉万博士继续说：“关于这种袋貂的一切都被遗忘了，这部分是对的。当地人对牠们完全没有印象，但有一些东西没有消失，有些部分留了下来。”\n"
"一阵低沉、如哭泣般的叫声从树林中传出来。伊拉万博士拿出一副双筒望远镜看向林地另一端的铁树林。隔著望远镜，你看到三只跟猫差不多大小的有袋动物，牠们有黄色的眼睛，攀附在树枝上，卷曲的尾巴在黑暗中晃动，正在吃某个东西。光是看著牠们就让你感到头晕目眩，牠们彷佛同时存在又不存在，你的双眼必须不断调整焦距。那些动物的动作有时僵硬，有时又过度灵活；有时过快，又有时过慢。你移开视线。\n"
"“你看到了吗？”伊拉万博士问到。你点头又再看了一次：那群袋貂正在吞食著一只绿色树蟒。“这太惊人了，颠覆性的变化，猎物变成了掠食者。我观察到的部分群体完全改变了习性，转而猎杀牠们原本的天敌，树蟒就是其中一个例子。他们的天性发生了根本的改变！”伊拉万博士兴奋到讲话结巴。“但最重要的是，牠们没有消失。我是说：对某些人来说牠们消失了，没人记得牠们。但牠们还在。”\n"
"你拿起望远镜再次看向袋貂，一瞬间你的血液彷佛冻结了：因为牠们正用明亮的黄色眼睛回看著你。你震惊到望远镜脱手掉落。但当你再度定睛看时，牠们全都不见了。你突然感到极度不安，试著说服伊拉万博士离开，但她摇头拒绝。“我正在目睹一个世纪大发现，这已经超越了动物学的范畴了，我不能现在离开。”\n"
"你留下伊拉万博士，回头朝小镇的方向走。周遭的丛林诡异的宁静，即使你走进月光照耀的空地时，你还是感觉到有东西在监视你。\n"
"接下来几天你与伊拉万博士保持著联系。但在你们要乘船离开的那天，她却不在客房中。旅馆员工告诉你她昨晚没有回来。你很担心她的安危，决定前往之前见到她的山洞。当你爬上山时，周遭的丛林依然弥漫著令人不安的寂静。\n"
"黑暗的山洞前四散著素描本的碎片跟损坏的望远镜，但没有伊拉万博士的踪影。你看向昏暗的矮林，看见伊拉万博士身上穿的蜡染背心在瀑布底部反射著亮光。你小心的走下泥泞的斜坡，来到动物学家身处的小溪河床上，她面朝下趴著，手臂弯成不正常的角度，三只袋貂在你靠近时四散而逃。你轻轻的将她翻过来，感觉到她还有呼吸时松了一口气。她的左手放在胸前，手中似乎握著某个黑色的物品。\n"
"你将伊拉万博士抱起来，她意外地轻。同时间，你头上传来尖锐的叫声，几十只黄色的眼睛从铁树上看著你揹著博士远离洞穴，向下游走去。发著微光的形体在你头上若即若离的飘荡，似乎在警告著你什么。\n"
"你一回到小镇就将昏迷的博士带到诊所进行检查。你订的船早已离开了，但有鉴于发生在博士身上的状况，你决定在此等她醒来。在经过几天坐立难安的等待后，她终于能开口说话。\n"
"“我注意到有几只袋貂聚集在这个东西周围。”她指著之前抓在手里的中空响钟说：“我不应该干涉的，但牠们似乎非常受其吸引。很奇怪，通常只有喜鹊或乌鸦会搜集这类物品。我发现牠们将它藏在树枝上，所以爬上去想更仔细的观察，然后就跌了下来。”\n"
"你拿起奇怪的响钟，感受它的重量跟形状。上面的浮雕对你跟博士来说都非常陌生。金属摸起来很冰冷，还带著一丝电流。你出于好奇，摇了它两下，即使没有铃舌，它发出的音波强到足以在空气中泛起涟漪，你甚至能感受到这股能量。屋外的树上传出了熟悉的哀泣声。\n"
"“这已经不只是一场生态调查了。”伊拉万博士低语著。“不管这些生物是什么，牠们都不再是赛提米乌斯貂了，牠们被改变了。”这位动物学家停顿了一下，斟酌著用词，然后对你微笑著说：“不管现在正发生什么事，我希望不用孤军奋战，也许我可以跟著你一起完成我的研究？”\n"
"你告诉伊拉万博士这样再好不过了，并同意等到她痊愈再一起离开。她信任地将奇怪的响钟交给你保管。"

msgid "Asking around town, each mention of Dr. Irawan is met with a curious stare. You go so far as to mime the zoologist’s distinct large eyeglasses, but nobody recognizes the name or the likeness. After several days, you abandon your fruitless search. As you check out from the local guest house, you find a blank sketchbook sitting on a wicker table. Picking it up, your skin pricks, and you have the feeling of being watched. But when you turn around, you are completely alone."
msgstr "你四处询问伊拉万博士的下落，但回应你的只有好奇与疑惑的眼神。你甚至试著模仿她特别的圆框眼镜，但没有人认得她的名字或长相。几天后你放弃了这趟无果的搜寻。在你退房时，你在一张藤编的桌子上找到一本空白的素描本。你拿起它，突然感到一阵恶寒，感觉像有东西在看著你。但你转身时身后却空无一人。"
