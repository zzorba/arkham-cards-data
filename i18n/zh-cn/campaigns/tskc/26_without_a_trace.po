"Even with the Foundation’s resources at your beck and call, it takes some finagling to charter a ship across the Devil’s Triangle, especially given you have no cargo to speak of and refuse to allow any other passengers on board, for their safety. After all, if your theory is correct, this ship’s destination does not exist on any map, and for all you know, it might be a one-way journey. Agent Quinn has convinced one of her colleagues to helm the ship, so as to not endanger a civilian, and together you set off for the center of the triangle, hearts in throats.\n"
"“The commissioner will have gotten word by now,” Quinn says, standing with you at the helm of the ship. “Probably the end of my career, I would wager.” She stares off at the horizon as the sun dips just below the waves. Despite her words, her expression is steadfast, without even a hint of regret. “I just hope we find answers.” You concede, with a bit of trepidation, that you almost hope you don’t. The idea of ending up just like the people who have been snatched—it chills you to the core. “Well, no turning back now. Care to do the honors?” she asks, motioning toward the white raven whistle which hangs from a cord around your neck. You pull it off and clutch it in your palm, considering your options."

"即使有基石的资源做后盾，你还是得运用一些欺瞒技巧才能找到愿意前往恶魔三角的船只，尤其又加上你没有货物也不允许其他乘客上船。但这是为了安全著想，毕竟如果你的假设是对的，你的目的地并不在地图上，而且很可能有去无回。奎茵探员设法说服了一位她的同事来掌舵，这样就不会有平民受害了。你们悬著一颗心，向三角区域的中心出发。\n"
"奎茵站在舵轮旁说：“调查官现在应该已经收到消息了。我想我的事业就到此为止了。”她看著远方的太阳隐没在波涛之下，虽然口中这样说，但她的表情坚定，没有一丝后悔。“我只希望能找到答案。”你出声同意，但还是不禁感到一丝不安。你们可能会落得跟那些被抓走的人一样的下场，想到这个就有一阵寒意渗入骨髓。“好吧，来不及反悔了，你来吗？”她看著挂在你脖子上的白色渡鸦哨子说。你将它握在掌中，思考著你的选择。"

msgid "Blow the whistle and summon Aliki to your side."
msgstr "吹响哨子召唤阿利琪前来。"

msgid "Dispose of the whistle and do this alone."
msgstr "扔掉哨子，独自面对。"

msgid "Reluctantly, you put the whistle to your lips and send its shrill, otherworldly warble across the ocean and perhaps beyond. A shudder creeps up your spine as the wind picks up. Within moments, the girl with the red sash has appeared, standing on the deck of your ship as though she had always been there. She speaks in Coptic, her words muffled by whistling wind. “She says thank you,” Quinn translates, “for trusting her.” You wouldn’t go that far. But she seems to know more about where you’re going than you do, and you need every bit of help you can get if you are to survive. Then, just as the wind begins to die down, Aliki Uperetria turns and points over the bow of the ship, seemingly at nothing at all but dark, choppy waves and the dim evening horizon."
msgstr "你不情愿地将哨子放到嘴边，吹出了尖锐的声响，奇异的声音跨越，甚至穿透了海洋。逐渐增强的风势让你打从脊柱感到一阵冷颤。没过多久，绑著红丝带的少女就现身在甲板上，好像她一直都在这一样。她说了一句科普特语，但在风声中变得难以辨识，奎茵翻译到：“她说谢谢，谢谢你愿意信任她。”但你可称不上是信任她，只是因为她看起来比你更了解接下来会发生什么事，而你想尽可能取得能让你活下来的助力。接著就在风势逐渐减弱时，阿利琪·乌佩雷特里亚转身指向船头的方向，但前方看起来没什么特别的，只有黑暗、起伏的海浪跟昏暗的地平线。"

msgid "the cell blew the whistle."
msgstr "吹响哨子。"

msgid "After a moment of consideration, you hurl the whistle into the dark waves of the Atlantic. Quinn watches with horror as the ocean swallows it. “What did you do that for? She could have helped us!” You explain that the Coterie is not to be trusted, and that perhaps now—with the evidence of their cooperation disposed of—Taylor will allow Quinn to keep her position in the Foundation. “You did that… for me?” she says under her breath, stunned. “Well… I hope for our sake you know what you are doing. Where we are headed, we are going to need all the help we can get.” She glances over the bow of the ship, and you wonder if you are truly headed to another realm, or if you will simply greet the horizon."
msgstr "经过考虑后，你将哨子抛进了大西洋的波涛中，奎茵惊恐地看著海浪将它吞噬。“你为什么要这么做？她可以帮我们的！”你解释到不能信任结社，而也许现在跟他们合作的证据消失了，泰勒或许会让奎茵保住她在基石的工作。“你是……为了我？”她惊讶地倒抽一口气。“嗯……为了我们好，我希望你清楚自己在做什么。在我们将要去的地方，我们会需要所有可能的协助。”她看向船头，怀疑著你们是真的要前往另一个次元；又或只是正朝地平线另一端开去。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record <i>Agent Quinn has your back</i>. Any one investigator may choose to add the Agent Ari Quinn story asset to their deck. It does not count toward their deck size. This card can be found in the <i>Globetrotting</i> encounter set."

"Clouds hang still over the Atlantic, the ocean suddenly calmer than you have ever seen it before. “Look at that,” Quinn says, pointing at the surface of the water. “No fish, no waves, not even a ripple from the ship.” A feeling of regret in your throat, you rush to the bow of the ship and look out into the distance. Something in the air shimmers—a slight distortion, nothing more—just a trick of the eye—and then, without a moment of warning, the ship is swallowed whole. The clouds burst. Light and color and luster overtakes you, cosmic radiance swathed in transcendental mist. The sight is marvelous and awful, mesmerizing and haunting all at once. You shut your eyes, but colors wash behind your eyelids over and over and over again. Then, finally, what feels like an eternity later, you feel a tap on your shoulder and open your eyes. The sight that greets you is unlike anything you have ever seen.\n"
"Aliki was right—if the things that disappeared were taken, this is surely where they ended up: an impossibly jumbled city of twisting architecture and technology both alien and familiar, an unearthly repository for everything that has ever been forgotten and forsaken. A range of sickly purples span the sky above, and snaking throughout the tangled towers and effigies are swirling, shimmering entities of vapor and colorless radiance.\n"
"Stunned into silence, you simply stare at the horrifying, awe-inspiring horizon before you, devoid of ocean, devoid of humanity, devoid of life. This is the barren truth to which your investigation has led: The Outside."
msgstr ""
"云层飘在大西洋的天空中，海面突然变得前所未有的平静。奎茵指著水面说：“看，没有鱼、没有波浪，连船身造成的涟漪都没有。”一股后悔的感觉突然涌上心头，你冲向船头看著远方，空气中有某种闪光，微微的扭曲，也许只是光线造成的错觉——突然，毫无预兆地，整艘船都被吞噬。云层爆炸了，光线、色彩跟宇宙辐射形成的超现实迷雾包围了你。这个景象既神奇又恐怖；既迷人又令人不适。你闭上眼睛，但感觉各种色彩一次又一次刮过你的眼皮。最后，像是经过了永恒，你感觉有人碰了你的肩膀，你张开眼，看见一幅前所未见的景象。\n"
"阿利琪是对的，如果某样东西被带走了，那这里就是它的终点。违反常理的杂乱城市中充满了扭曲的建筑；各种熟悉与陌生的科技产物。这是一座埋葬被遗忘跟遗弃事物的外星坟场。一抹病态的紫色在天空中蔓延，以雾气与无色辐射组成的存在用牠发光、扭动的触手缠上各种塔楼与塑像。\n"
"你惊讶得说不出话，只是盯著你面前可怕同时又令人惊叹的景象。没有海洋、没有人类、没有生命的气息，你的调查引领你来到这个真相所在的不毛之地，这里是——异域。"
