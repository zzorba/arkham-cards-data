"As soon as you arrive in Buenos Aires, you set your meeting with Oficial Bolívar at a café overlooking the harbor. Seagulls cry out over the many shipping and fishing boats in the distance. Even after Bolívar arrives, you continue to keep an eye out for others listening in—for anyone wearing red, especially. The officer meets you in uniform instead of casual clothes—whether by protocol or due to being overworked, you are unsure. His response to your letter seemed overly eager. Perhaps he is as starved for information regarding his target as you are? “Your letter suggested we may be able to aid one another,” he says casually, after calling out for a café chico. “You have information regarding La Chica Roja?”\n"
"You clarify that you are the one seeking information from Bolívar, not the other way around. “Well, scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours,” he says, his expression turning serious. “What do you know?”"
msgstr ""
"抵达布宜诺斯艾利斯后你立即安排与玻利瓦督察见面。你们约在港边的一间咖啡厅会面，海鸥在天空鸣叫，遥遥可见许多渔船与商船来来往往。即使在玻利瓦走进店门后，你也依然注意著周遭的人，尤其是那些身著红色衣物的人。督察穿著制服前来，你不确定是出于规定还是他正在工作。他对你信件的回应显得有点过于积极，也许他跟你一样极需更多关于目标的情报？他点了一小杯咖啡后一派轻松地说道：“你的信中说我们可以互相帮助，你有红姑娘的情报？”\n"
"你表示是你要向玻利瓦询问情报，而不是反过来。他的表情变得严肃：“你帮我，我就会帮你。所以，你知道些什么？“"

msgid "Tell Bolívar everything regarding the target."
msgstr "告诉玻利瓦所有情报。"

msgid "Give Bolívar some breadcrumbs."
msgstr "告诉玻利瓦部分情报。"

msgid "Insist that Bolívar tells you what he knows."
msgstr "坚持要玻利瓦先透漏情报。"

msgid ""
"You decide that honesty is the best policy. You doubt he would believe your tale about extraterrestrials and secret organizations, but you can at least tell him what you know regarding “La Chica Roja.” He mulls over the information you give him, taking a minute to process everything. “Hmm… so you really believe that La Chica Roja has these… abilities…?” You tell him you are certain. It may be tough to believe, but it is important that Bolívar understand the reality of the situation. “I knew it. I knew it!” he grins. “Of course! It makes so much sense. The way she would vanish into thin air, move with such speed…” You hadn’t expected him to believe you, but it turns out your information has only confirmed his own suspicions. “So how do you intend to help us catch her?”\n"
"You tell Bolívar that you intend to capture her on your own. All you need from him is information regarding her objective and last known whereabouts in Buenos Aires. He pulls several photos of buildings in Buenos Aires out of his folder and reveals them to you. “La Chica Roja has carved a path of thievery and mischief throughout Buenos Aires. Hundreds of thousands of pesos in stolen art and artifacts.” He points to each of the photos, one by one. “Casa Rosada, Palacio Errázuriz, Teatro Colón. She has been spotted many times, but try as we might, we cannot catch her in the act. Those in charge are, shall we say…unhappy… with how the situation has been handled.” He looks away and scratches at the back of his hand as he stammers. It is clear to you that Bolívar’s career is on the line. But you know the stakes are much higher than even that. “It is like she is toying with us. Mocking us.” He strikes the surface of the table in frustration. “Making a killing while making fools of us all.”"

"你认为展现诚信才是上上之策。也许他不会相信背后有一些无国界的秘密组织在运作，但至少可以告诉他有关“红姑娘”的部分。他吸收著你告知的资讯，花了几分钟整理思绪。“嗯……所以你真的相信她有某种……力量？”你表示你很肯定，虽然可能很难接受，但更重要的是让玻利瓦认清现实。“我就知道！”他嘴角咧起。“她当然有！现在一切都合理多了，为什么她可以凭空消失，还可以用那种速度移动……。“你没意料到他会相信你，但你的情报似乎是证实了他长久以来的猜测。“所以，你要怎么帮助我们逮到她？”\n"
"你对玻利瓦表示你打算独力抓到她，你只需要她在布宜诺斯艾利斯活动地点的情报。玻利瓦从档案夹中抽出几张照片给你。“红姑娘在布宜诺斯艾利斯一路作案捣乱，无数价值连城的画作与艺术品失窃。”他指著一张一张的照片说：“玫瑰宫、埃拉苏里宫、哥伦布剧院。她被目击到许多次，但不管我们怎么尝试都无法在她作案时逮到她。上级们对这个状况非常……不满意。”他撇开目光，边抓挠自己的手背边心虚的说。显然玻利瓦的职涯岌岌可危，但这件事牵扯的远不止他个人的事业。“她就像是在玩弄我们、嘲笑我们。”玻利瓦挫折的捶著桌子。“把我们当笨蛋耍，我们最后都会被她害死。”"

msgid "If an investigator has the [[Criminal]] trait:"
msgstr "如果有[[罪犯]]属性的调查员："

msgid "You of all people know better than to presume the target’s intent from so little. Had she intended to sell the stolen relics, there would be evidence of such sales on the black market. She would likely make as much or more ransoming the goods back to their owners. Besides, you doubt the Coterie is after mere wealth. There must be some other value to the stolen items."
msgstr "在线索如此稀少的状况下，你比任何人都还清楚要从何处著手。如果她想要脱手这些赃物，那在黑市里一定有迹可循，在黑市交易会比要求原主赎回赃物还赚得更多。但是你怀疑结社不可能只是纯粹追求财富，这些失窃的物品一定有其他方面的价值。"

msgid "You tell Oficial Bolívar that you will help him find the Girl in the Carmine Coat, but only if he aids you in your investigation. “Of course,” he says with a grin. “If it means we can finally put that thief behind bars, I will do what I can.” You shake the man’s hand and together, a plan begins to brew."
msgstr "你向玻利瓦督察表示你会协助他们抓到红大衣女孩，但他们必须也协助你的调查。“这是当然的。”他爽快的答应。“只要能逮到那个小贼，我会尽我所能。”你们握了握手，开始制定计划。"

"For the sake of diplomacy, you decide to give Bolívar a few harmless bits of information regarding “La Chica Roja,” but nothing more. You can’t risk the truth of the situation getting out. Better that the police think of the Girl in the Carmine Coat as only an extraordinarily skilled thief, and nothing more. “That is all you know?” he asks, incredulous. “And here I thought that you being here meant… Oh well. I suppose she really is a mystery, after all. So how do you intend to help us catch her?”\n"
"You tell Bolívar that you intend to capture her on your own. All you need from him is information regarding her objective and last known whereabouts in Buenos Aires.

It is clear to you that Bolívar’s career is on the line. But you know the stakes are much higher than that. “She is toying with us. She will toy with you too. Chew your investigation up and spit you out.”\n"
"You assure Oficial Bolívar that you can catch her, but it’s better if his team stays out of your way. “If it means putting that thief behind bars, I will let you have a go at it,” he agrees. You shake the man’s hand, and a plan begins to brew.\n"

"为了避免外交上的麻烦，你决定只告诉玻利瓦一部分“红姑娘”的情报，你不能冒险将事情复杂化。最好让警方认为红大衣女孩只是个技巧高超的神偷就好。“你知道的就只有这样？”玻利瓦无法置信。“我以为你来到这里是代表……算了，她是真的非常神秘。所以你打算如何帮助我们逮到她？”\n"
"你对玻利瓦表示你打算独力抓到她，你只需要她在布宜诺斯艾利斯活动地点的情报。玻利瓦从档案夹中抽出几张照片给你。“红姑娘在布宜诺斯艾利斯一路作案捣乱，无数价值连城的画作与艺术品失窃。“他指著一张一张的照片说：“玫瑰宫、埃拉苏里宫、哥伦布剧院。她被目击到许多次，但不管我们怎么尝试都无法在她作案时逮到她。上级们对这个状况非常……不满意。”他撇开目光，边抓挠自己的手背边心虚的说。显然玻利瓦的职涯岌岌可危，但这件事牵扯的远不止他个人的事业。“她在玩弄我们，你也会被她耍的团团转，她会把你的调查像嚼口香糖一样，嚼腻了就吐掉。”\n"
"你向玻利瓦督察保证你一定会抓到她”但建议他的团队不要涉入。“只要能逮到那个小贼”我会尽我所能。”他同意了。你们握了握手，你开始制定计划。\n"

"You shake your head. This isn’t a negotiation—you cannot let Oficial Bolívar and his investigation impede yours in any way. “And what makes you think I am going to cooperate if you refuse to assist?”\n"
"You pull out one of the letters given to you by Agent Taylor and hand it to Bolívar. He opens it slowly and warily, keeping his eyes on you the entire time. It takes him little time to read through the entire thing, after which he crumples it up and tosses it back onto the table. “Damn you,” he says. You ask him once more what he knows regarding the target’s objective and last known whereabouts. He pulls several photos of buildings in Buenos Aires out of his folder and tosses them onto the table. “La Chica Roja has carved a path of thievery and mischief throughout Buenos Aires. Hundreds of thousands of pesos in stolen art and artifacts.” He points to each of the photos, one by one. “Casa Rosada, Palacio Errázuriz, Banco de la Provincia. She has been spotted many times, but try as we might, we cannot catch her in the act. And now here you are, complicating the whole ordeal.”\n"
"You examine the photos, ignoring Bolívar’s annoyed glare. It’s obvious that his career is on the line, but you cannot let the frustration of one man get in the way of your investigation. If the police get to the Girl in the Carmine Coat before you do, the best case scenario is that it will be tougher for you to get the information you need from her. Worst case scenario, it will only put them all in danger. Better for you to be the one to confront her.\n"
"You tell Oficial Bolívar that his team is to stay out of your way while you conduct your own investigation. Furthermore, you must be the one to question her if she is taken into custody—not the police. He lets out a sigh and shakes his head. “Do what you’re gonna do. Won’t be my head on the chopping block this time.” You get the feeling that Bolívar doesn’t think you can pull this off, but unlike him, you understand what you’re truly up against… though you still don’t know why. You take his documents and begin to brew a plan."

"你摇头拒绝，你不是来被审问的。不能让玻利瓦督察妨碍你。你对他说：“你为什么会认为在你不愿提供协助的状况下，我还会跟你合作？”\n"
"你拿出调查官泰勒给你的信交给玻利瓦。他一边怀疑的盯著你，一边缓慢的将信抽出来。他花了一点时间看完内容，然后将它揉烂丢在桌上。“去你的。”你再度要求他提供目标的情报跟最后目击的地点。他从档案夹中抽出几张布宜诺斯艾利斯建筑的照片、将它们丢在桌上。“红姑娘在布宜诺斯艾利斯一路作案捣乱，无数价值连城的画作与艺术品失窃。“他指著一张一张的照片说：“玫瑰宫、埃拉苏里宫、省立银行。她被目击到许多次，但不管我们怎么尝试都无法在她作案时逮到她。而现在你又来搅局，把一切弄得更复杂。”\n"
"你忽略玻利瓦控诉的目光，迳自研究著照片。显然玻利瓦的职涯岌岌可危，但你不能让这位挫折的警官介入你的调查。如果警方先逮到红大衣女孩，把你之后的行动变的更加困难已经是最好的情况了；最糟的情况是他们都将置于危险之中。最好还是由你独自与她接触。\n"
"你告诉玻利瓦督察在你进行调查时不要妨碍到你。而且如果成功抓到红大衣女孩，你必须是第一个讯问她的人，而不是警方。玻利瓦叹了口气，摇了摇头：“随便你，反正这次不是我要上断头台了。”你知道他并不觉得你能成功，但你与他不同，虽然还不清楚红大衣女孩的动机，但你很清楚自己真正面对的是谁。你拿走了档案然后开始制定计划。"

"You’re not with the police, you insist. “I suppose that much is obvious. I don’t see that fool Bolívar anywhere. But if that’s truly the case, then who do you work for?” she asks. “You know what, nevermind that. You seem to know who I work for, don’t you? Well then, surely you must know there are two of us operating in Buenos Aires. Why aren’t you after the other guy?”\n"

You, my friend, have outdated information.” You ask if she is using the stolen art pieces to assemble a Key, as the Foundation’s intel suggested. “Key? Oh, I see. You call them ‘Keys.’ Well, yes, that much is true. But you’re missing the why.”\n"
"The Girl in the Carmine Coat paces through the room, stepping in and out of countless shadows. “The other guy. ‘The Sanguine Watcher,’ they call him. Nobody knows his real name.” She takes off her hat and runs her finger along its scarlet hatband before using it to mask her countenance. “Just like me, I guess. Nameless. Faceless.” Then she rolls it back onto her head with a chuckle. “Only, el observador sanguinario ain’t like me. He’s already got his hands on more than a few pieces. Even with just those, he’ll use it only out of cruelty and malice. Human experimentation. Spellcraft. Real creepy stuff. He gets the rest of ‘em, who knows what he’ll do with them. My associates tend to thrive on that kind of thing. But not me.” Her fierce brown eyes lock with yours, soft and steely all at once. “I came here to stop him.”"

"红大衣女孩在房间中踱步，在阴影间若隐若现。“另一个家伙，他们叫他‘讪笑监视者’，没人知道他的真实身分。”红姑娘脱下帽子，用手指勾住帽带并用它遮住自己的脸。“跟我一样，没有名字、没人认得。”她轻声一笑，将帽子带回头上。“只是，监视者先生不喜欢我。他已经取得好几片碎片了，他将它们用在残忍、恶毒的用途上：人体实验、邪恶魔法之类的可怕用途。如果他拿到剩下的碎片，天知道他还会做出什么事，我的同志似乎很热衷于伤害他人。”她炽烈的棕色眼睛与你四目相对，眼中同时流露出柔和与决心。“但我不一样，我是来阻止他的。”"

The darkness peels back, revealing a scarlet-red sky. “His mark. Been keeping it hidden for a while now so nobody panics.

msgid "You rush to apprehend your quarry, but with a twirl of shadows, she has vanished. It is as if she was a trick of the light all along—the same kind of mischief mirrored in Oficial Bolívar’s reports. Thankfully, you now possess enough of what she was after to put it together yourself. It takes some time and research, but eventually you are able to slot the various pieces of what you originally assumed to be art together. To your surprise, the result is an ornate figurine of a woman in robes. Tears, carved as thin lines like bloody scars, trail down the figure’s cheeks. With your new prize in tow, you report back to Oficial Bolívar the next day. He is more than a little miffed that his enemy escaped his grasp, but relieved that her campaign of thievery is finally at an end. “I warned you she would get away,” he says between sips of his espresso. “As far as my superiors are concerned, the book is closed on this one. Won’t look good on my record, but as long as she’s fled the city like you say, I am content with that.” You thank him again for his help and prepare to leave Buenos Aires behind."
msgstr "你向前一扑想要抓住目标，但她随著一道旋转的阴影消失了。就好像她的存在只是某种光影的把戏，跟你在玻利瓦督察报告中看到的一样。庆幸的是你已经获得了足够的部件，能够组合起她在找寻的东西。你很惊讶成品是一个身著长袍的精美女性雕像，鲜红的眼泪像伤疤一般划过她的脸颊。隔天你带著你的战利品向玻利瓦督察回报，他有点不高兴他的敌人从他指缝间溜走了，但又对这一连串窃案终于结束感到松了口气。“我警告过你她会成功逃走吧。”他边啜饮著咖啡边说，“至少就我的长官们关注的问题来说，这件案子算是结束了。虽然我的记录不会太好看，但如果她真像你说的离开了城市，那我也就满意了。”你再次感谢他提供的协助，然后准备离开布宜诺斯艾利斯。"

msgid "Your erstwhile adversary watches in grim silence as her rival is safely borne aloft on wings of darkness. “Damned things,” she spits. “They’ll follow whoever whistles loudest, I guess.” You ponder aloud what this means for the two of you. With the Sanguine Watcher out of the way, you wonder if she will keep her word. To your relief, she smirks and hands you the remaining pieces of the Key you’d both been competing for. “This is what you’re really after, isn’t it? Here. My main goal was only making sure that ojete en una nube de pedos didn’t get his hands on it. I trust it in your hands.” She then shows you how to fit the various pieces together and, to your surprise, the result is an ornate figurine of a woman in robes. Tears, carved as thin lines like bloody scars, trail down the figure’s cheeks. “The Rubicund Statuette,” she reveals, “also known as the Weeping Lady.” You ask what she will do now, and she responds with a tip of her hat. “Oh, I’ll be around. You helped me out back there. Don’t worry. I’ll pay you back.” With a twirl of her coat, she is gone."
msgstr "你的旧敌人冷眼看著她的对手被黑色的双翼带上天空。“该死的玩意儿，”她啐了一口：“我猜谁口哨吹得最大声，牠们就听谁的。”你思考著现在的状况代表著什么，现在监视者逃了，她还会遵守承诺吗？你在她将剩下的密钥碎片交给你时松了口气。“这才是你真正的目标对吧？拿去吧，我的目的只是确保那个浑身发臭的混蛋得不到它而已。我相信交到你手中会更好。”接著她教你如何将不同的碎片结合起来，你很惊讶成品是一个身著长袍的精美女性雕像，鲜红的眼泪像伤疤一般划过她的脸颊。“鲜红雕像，”她说到，“又叫做泣血女士。”你问她接下来有什么打算。她点了点帽子说：“喔，我会罩著你的。你帮了我，别担心，我会回报你的。”随即她一旋大衣消失了。"

msgid "Oficial Bolívar was right: the Girl in the Carmine Coat chewed your investigation up and spat you out. You meet with him the next day, and the air is one of deadened frustration. “I warned you, did I not?” He says between sips of an espresso that looks and smells about as dark and bitter as his mood. “This puts me in a precarious position. La Chica Roja has gone to ground, from what we can tell. As far as my superiors are concerned, the book is closed on this one. I cannot help you any further.” He groans. “If I even still have a job when this is all over.” You give Oficial Bolívar your assurances that you did all you could to catch the thief, but he waves you off. “Oh, I am sure. Does not matter now, does it? What is done is done. I give up. She wins.” You thank him again and prepare to leave Buenos Aires behind."
msgstr "玻利瓦督察是对的，红大衣女孩的确把你玩弄于股掌之间。你隔天与玻利瓦见面，挫折的气氛让空气一片死寂。“我警告过你，没错吧？”他边啜饮著咖啡边说，心情跟手中的咖啡一样黑暗且苦涩。“我现在的处境岌岌可危，据我们所知，红姑娘似乎收手了。对于我的长官们来说，这件案子算是结束了，所以我无法再提供你任何协助。”他嘟哝著说。“我连这一切结束后我还能不能保住工作都不知道。”你向玻利瓦督察保证你已尽了全力抓捕这个小偷，但他只是挥挥手说：“哦，我相信你，但有没有都没差了对吧？木已成舟，我放弃，她赢了。”你再次感谢他提供的协助，然后准备离开布宜诺斯艾利斯。"
