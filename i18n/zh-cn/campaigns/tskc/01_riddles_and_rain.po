"The dark stifles. It moves like a living creature, constricts the air as if you were inside a shapeless cocoon. A figment of your anxious and overactive imagination, you hope. But everything about this meeting puts your nerves on edge. You almost didn’t accept the mysterious invitation, but recent events have forced your hand. It’s been several months since the disappearances began, and all of your leads in Arkham have dried up.\n"
"It started in the winter of 1924 with several vehicles in Southside: two Studebakers, a Cadillac, and a Rolls Royce, all of them top-of-the-line. One moment they were there, the next… nothing, save for a single deflated wheel. The police believed it to be the work of bootleggers looking for more vehicles to add to their routes, but the cars were too nice, would draw too much attention. Perhaps they were taken down to Boston or New York and flipped for a pretty penny, and that’s just what you figured happened… until the disappearances continued.\n"
"Next to go was a streetlamp outside the Ward Theatre in Downtown. Then, two pets—a dog and a cat, whisked away almost simultaneously right out from under their owners’ noses, not two doors down from one another. You learned the news when you saw the missing posters plastered all over College Street. On a whim, you interviewed the owners. No sign of foul play, and it was unlikely for them to have run away. Something stank about all of it.\n"
"Then people started to disappear. A child from Easttown. A student in Miskatonic University. The chief of Arkham’s fire department. And as the police closed each case with no clues or suspects, a curious thing began to happen. One by one, as time marched on, the things that went missing vanished not only from Arkham, but from memory. The owners of those vehicles suddenly claimed to have never owned them. The pets, the people, all of them were wiped from the memories of every single person in town.\n"
"Everyone but you. You, and you alone, remembered.\n"
"Perhaps it was simply the way of things. Humans are fickle and forgetful by nature. But it couldn’t be so simple. It was just too…strange. Coincidental.\n"
"That’s when the letter arrived.\n"
"<typewriter>\tGreetings,</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tI hope this letter finds you well. You do not know me, but I know you. I cannot tell you much through paper correspondence, as it may be intercepted. Suffice it to say that I know of the matters you are looking into, and I also know that you believe yourself to be alone in your investigation. The truth is that you are not alone. Such events are not unique to your city of Arkham. What you have observed is happening in major cities all over the world. I am one of those, like you, who seeks the truth. Who remembers.</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tThere is another related matter which I must bring to your attention. I need your help, and you need mine. Enclosed is a ticket to a show at the Riverview Theater. If you wish to know more, please meet me there and we can speak further. Come alone.</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tIn truth,</typewriter>\n"
"<fancy>\t\tLi Flint</fancy>\n"
"The ticket in the envelope was indeed for a private showing at Arkham’s new movie palace in Downtown. With no other leads and no good reason to avoid going, you have decided to accept the mysterious invitation…"

"黑暗令人窒息。就像一个活物正逐渐将空气收紧，想将你困于无形的茧内。你希望这只是焦虑引起的过度想像。但这次会面让你的所有神经都高度警戒。你差点拒绝了这个神秘的邀请，但最近的事件让你别无选择。失踪事件已经持续了好几个月，而你在阿卡姆的线索已经全部断绝。\n"
"这一切是从1924年的冬天开始的，有几辆车在南区离奇消失，两辆斯图贝克、一辆凯迪拉克跟一辆劳斯莱斯，全是最顶级的车款，现场只剩下一个漏气的轮胎。警方认为是走私贩们的手笔，但这些车太高级了，会引来不必要的注意。它们也许被运往波士顿或纽约销赃了，你正这样觉得时……更多消失事件持续发生。\n"
"接著消失的是在商业区沃德戏院外的路灯。然后两只宠物——一只狗跟一只猫，在不同的地点几乎同时从主人面前跑走，你从贴在大学街上的传单上得知这件事。出于一时的奇想，你访谈了两位饲主，看起来不像恶作剧，你也看不出宠物们有什么逃离他们的理由。这一切感觉有奇特的关联。\n"
"接著人们也开始失踪。东城区的一个小孩、米斯卡塔尼克大学的一名学生、阿卡姆消防局的队长。而就在警方由于找不到线索与嫌疑犯只好结束调查后，奇怪的事发生了。一个接一个，随著时间过去，消失的人事物也在人们的记忆中消失了。那些车辆的主人宣称他们从来没买过这些车，宠物、活人，所有关于他们的记忆都被从每个人的记忆中抹除了。\n"
"每个人，除了你以外，只有你一人还记得。\n"
"也许这是自然现象，人们一向善变又健忘。但事情不可能这么简单，这一切都太……奇怪了，也太巧合了。\n"
"就在此时，你收到了一封信。\n"
"<typewriter>你好，</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>我希望这封信安全送达你手中。你不认识我，但我认识你。我不能在信中说太多，它可能会被拦截。简单来说我知道你正在调查的事，我也知道你认为自己是唯一一个，但事实上你不是。类似的事件不只在阿卡姆发生，你现在面临的事件也正在全世界各个主要城市发生。我是其中一员，跟你一样，找寻真相的人、未遗忘的人。</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>我有另一件与此相关的事必须告诉你。我需要你的帮助，如同你需要我的一样。信中附上的是河景戏院的票。如果你想知道更多，请到那里跟我见面，让我们深入交谈。请独自前来。</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>真挚的，</typewriter>\n"
"<fancy>李·弗林特</fancy>\n"
"信封中附上一张私人表演的票，地点是阿卡姆商业区新开幕的电影院。你已经失去所有线索，也没有更好的选择，你决定接受这个神秘的邀约。"

"Flint produces a file fat with documentation and slides it between the two seat cushions in front of you. Inside is a wealth of information regarding cases similar to the ones you have been investigating. Photos of vehicles, factory machines, and public figures, all missing. All forgotten. And just as Flint’s letter promised, the file includes reports from all over the world. London. Shanghai. Bruges. Rio de Janeiro. Cairo. The list goes on and on. “There’s more,” he says after giving you time to read. “Flip to the end.”\n"
"You do, and what greets you there are two photographs clipped together. The first is of a street in London, distorted by some sort of interference. A light shines above the street corner, and around it, the picture appears to be pinched, like a miniature vortex is pulling reality toward it. The other is a photograph of a man on the other side of that same street corner, ducking into the shadows. He wears a tailored grey suit and a wide-brimmed hat that obscures his face. The only discernible detail you can make out from the photo is the man’s distinctive red gloves. Rare as it is for a photograph to have color, you wonder if the long exposure time is what led to the strange blurring effect. “This was taken by my partner several days ago. Just before he, too, vanished. Whatever is going on, you can be sure that man with the red gloves is somehow involved.”\n"
"Getting to the point, you ask Inspector Flint what exactly he wants from you. “To work together. Share what we know. Sparingly few seem to know the truth.” You agree. If what the man says is true, and events like this are happening all over the world, getting to the bottom of it will require more than just you. “To that end, I would ask that you come to London with me. That man with the red gloves has been sighted in the area, and he’s not alone. I would bet good money that he knows something about where my partner is. Arrangements have already been made. There are steamship tickets in that file. The ship departs from Boston in two days.”"

"弗林特从座椅中的空隙递给你一份厚重的资料夹。里面是与你调查内容相似的资料。车辆的照片、工厂里的机器，还有各种公共设施，都消失并被遗忘了。而就如弗林特说的，里面还有世界上其他城市的资料。伦敦、上海、布鲁日、里约热内卢、开罗，还有更多其他城市。你翻阅了一阵子后弗林特开口说道：“还不只这些，翻到最后一页。”\n"
"你照做，在末页看到两张被钉在一起的照片。第一张是伦敦某条街道，但被某种力量模糊了。一道光打在街角，它周围的景物看起来被扭曲了，就像是有一个小漩涡正在将周围的东西吸进去。另一张照片是在街角的另一端，有个男人隐没在阴影中，他穿著合身的灰色西装，戴著一顶遮住脸的宽边帽。唯一一个可辨识的东西是他的红色手套。有颜色的照片非常少见，你同时也在怀疑是不是曝光时间过长导致了模糊的效果。“这是几天前我的搭档拍摄的，就在他消失之前。无论到底发生什么事，一定都跟那个红手套的男人有关。”\n"
"你切入重点，直接询问弗林特警探希望你做什么。“一起行动、分享情报，共同发掘真相。”你同意了，如果他说的是真的，全世界都在发生类似的事件，那单凭你是无法查出真相的。”所以我必须邀请你跟我一起前往伦敦。红手套的男人在那里被目击，而且他不是单独行动。我敢打赌他知道我的搭档在哪里。我已经安排好了，档案夹里有张船票，两天后在波士顿出发。”"

"“现在我可以把手放下了吗？”弗林特警探问。"

"You search for the man with the red gloves through every possible hiding place and down every shadowed corridor, but he is well and truly gone. It is as if he vanished into thin air. You wonder for a moment if he was somehow erased from existence like the other disappearances, but you don’t believe so. There is no mark. No ectoplasmic remains. He simply was there, and then he was not.\n"
"You give up searching for him and instead examine the crypt that the man was rummaging through. Inside is an old and forgotten corpse, likely hundreds of years old. You don’t have the object here to do a perfect size comparison, but you are quite sure that the ruby marble the red-gloved man stole before disappearing would have fit inside one of the corpse’s eyesockets. Indeed, examining the corpse, you see that one such socket is covered in webs and sickly with rot, while the other remains strangely smooth on the inside. Whatever that marble is, it must have been what the man with the red gloves sought all along… but why?\n"
"Investigating further, you find neither name nor epitaph identifying the corpse buried here, only the following lines of what appears to be poetry chiseled into the lid of the body’s coffin:\n"
"<center>With red we are bound.</center>\n"
"<center>Through red we are one.</center>\n"
"<center>Thus in red do we bury our kin and our ken.</center>\n"
"<center>May you rest, until you are needed once more.</center>\n"
"Before you have time to even consider what this might mean, you hear the telltale rumbling of the secret passageway shifting upstairs once more, and the pounding of heavy footsteps down the stairwell. You arm yourself and prepare for a fight. To your surprise, it is Inspector Flint who greets you, held at gunpoint by a woman dressed in a black suit, wide-brimmed hat, and matching black trousers. She has ebony-dark skin, cold eyes underscored by heavy bags, and short, curly hair. Two other suits flank her, both of whom say nothing and stand like statues as she enters the crypt. She flashes an unidentifiable silver badge and motions for you to stay put. “Where did the man with the red gloves go?” she asks. “And who exactly are you?”\n"
"“Can I put my hands down now?” Inspector Flint says."

"你搜寻了每个可能的躲藏处跟每条黑暗的长廊，但红手套确实已经离开了，就像消失在空气中一样。虽然有瞬间你怀疑他是不是像其他人一样被抹除了，但你不这样认为。没有痕迹，也没有黏液般的物质。他纯粹就是消失了。\n"
"你放弃搜寻他，转向检视红手套翻找的墓穴，里面是具年代久远的遗骸，看来已经下葬数百年了。虽然没有东西可以比对，但你很确定红手套偷走的那颗红宝石珠原先一定是镶在死者的眼眶中。因为一边的眼眶已经腐烂并被蛛网覆盖，而另一边则很诡异的非常干净而光滑。不管那个珠子是什么，它一定就红手套在找的东西但……原因是什么呢？\n"
"仔细调查后，你还是找不到这名死者的姓名与身分，只发现一段刻在棺盖上的短诗：\n"
"<center>我们因绯红结契。</center>\n"
"<center>我们因绯红为一。</center>\n"
"<center>手足智识皆深埋绯红之中。</center>\n"
"<center>安息吧，直至你再度献身。</center>\n"

"You wait impatiently for Inspector Flint to arrive, your nerves on edge. Something must have happened to him. But you still remember him—that’s good. You tap your foot nervously as you strain to recall his face, the sound of his voice, the events that led you here. Tap tap tap. Perhaps you should be out there looking for him. What if he is in trouble? Tap tap tap. Maybe he is already gone. Perhaps only you remember him. And what of the man with the red gloves? Tap tap tap. You wait. And wait. And wait.\n"
"You barely notice the chair across from you sliding out until Flint takes his seat. To your relief, he is unharmed, although you suspect he has not slept in some time. Lines of worry are creased along his forehead, and his eyes are bloodshot and wide with fear. Yours feel the same.\n"
"Breaking the tense air with a joke, you inform Inspector Flint that he is late. He chuckles and nods. “Apologies. Another detective with the ICPC is… missing,” he explains, exhaustion and anxiety giving his voice a bitter edge. “Please tell me you have something for me.”\n"
"You sigh and give your report. Flint cradles his fingers and rubs them idly as you explain what you have learned. “This proves that the man with the red gloves is not working alone,” he says.\n"
"Just then, a woman’s voice interrupts from across the room. “That is an understatement,” she says, her voice cold and dry. The woman, dressed in a black suit, wide-brimmed hat, and matching black trousers, flashes an unidentifiable silver badge with one hand, and levels the barrel of a handgun at you with the other. She has ebony-dark skin, cold eyes underscored by heavy bags, and short, curly hair. Two other suits flank her, both of whom say nothing and stand like statues as she speaks. Both of them rest their hands on pistols holstered beneath their suit jackets. You realize with sudden terror that you are alone in the once-busy tea room. Everyone else has cleared out. Flint’s hands immediately shoot into the air, and yours quickly follow.\n"
"“Where is the man with the red gloves now?” the woman asks. “And who exactly are you?”\n"
"You and Flint share a worried glance. What exactly have you gotten yourselves into?"

"你神经紧绷地等待著弗林特警探出现。他一定出事了，但你还记得他的存在——这是好事。你焦虑地踱著步，努力记住他的脸、他的声音，跟引导你到此的一系列事件。答答答，也许你应该去找他，如果他遇上麻烦怎么办？答答答，也许他已经消失了，你是唯一记得他的人。红手套到底是何方神圣？答答答，你等了又等。\n"
"你差点没注意到对面的椅子被拉开，直到弗林特入座你才反应过来。他看起来没受伤，你松了一口气，但他看来有段时间没有睡觉了。他的额头上出现了焦虑的皱纹，双眼布满血丝，而且恐惧充斥其中。你感同身受。\n"
"你开玩笑说他迟到了，试著打破沉重的气氛。弗林特警探轻笑著点头：“我道歉。另一位ICPC的调查员失踪了”他解释道，焦虑与疲惫让他的声音充满苦涩。“请告诉我一些好消息。”\n"
"你叹了口气开始回报。在过程中弗林特漫不经心的把玩著自己的手指。他说：“这证明了红手套不是单独行动。”\n"
"“真是轻描淡写。”就在这时，有一个冷漠平淡的声音打断了你们，是一个坐在店里另一端的女人。她穿著黑色西装及长裤，头戴宽边帽。她一手拿著一枚无法辨识的银色徽章，另一手拿著手枪指著你们。她有檀木般深色的皮肤，冷酷的眼睛下方有很深的眼袋，以及修短的卷发。另外还有两名身著西装的人在她两侧，他们像雕像一般伫立，一言不发，他们的手也握著藏在西装外套中的手枪。你突然发现原本繁忙的茶馆只剩下你们两个，其他人都被请出去了。弗林特快速举高双手，你也马上照做。\n"
"那位女性开口问道：“那名戴著红手套的人在哪里？你们到底是谁？”\n"
"你跟弗林特交换了一个忧心的眼神，你们到底把自己牵扯进什么了？"
