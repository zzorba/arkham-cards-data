"Soon after arriving in Tokyo, you wander the city’s winding streets in the rain before sitting down at a food stall. Before you can order, a figure in a trenchcoat and wide-brimmed hat sits down next to you and whispers a phrase in a crisp British accent: “Six lions prowl at dusk.”\n"
"The phrase’s significance dawns on you after a moment, and you hurriedly recite the callback the Foundation operatives taught you: “A pride feasts in darkness.” The person next to you lowers the wide brim of her coat to reveal herself as Commissioner Taylor. She orders ramen for you both and looks away. “Before you ask: No, this is not a coincidence, and no, I will not tell you how I knew you would be here. It is my job to know more than you.”\n"
"You tell her she seems as brusque as usual, and a faint smile tugs at the edge of her lips. “Familiarity breeds liability, so let us keep this professional. Tell me what you have learned so far.” You shoot a worried look at the crowd around you. The commissioner shakes her head. “I saw to it that you were not followed. Talk.” Your eyes wander to the gun holstered to her belt, and you wonder what lengths she went to in the name of privacy.\n"
"Digging into the steaming bowl of ramen, you recount your findings so far. The rain falls hard around you, mingling with the smell of grilled meats and sweet spices. You spy a flash of red in the crowd, but when you look, all you see is the reflection on a blood-red fan. The commissioner snaps her fingers and you continue. Once you finish your report, Taylor pays for the meal and stands.\n"
"“It sounds as though your efforts are, shall we say, adequate?” she says primly. “However, the Foundation has a request. We need you to deliver a package to our sanctum in Lagos. Please see that it is delivered safely.” She hands you a sheaf of documents bound with cord."

"你走在东京起风下雨的街道上，找了一间摊贩坐了下来。在你还没来得及点餐前，一个穿著风衣、带著宽边帽的人在你旁边坐下，用清脆的英国腔低语道：“六只狮子于黄昏狩猎。”\n"
"你迟疑了一下后想起了这句话代表的意义，你赶紧用基石探员教你的暗语回应：“黑暗中的傲人飨宴。”身旁的人放低衣领，是调查官泰勒。她帮你们各叫了一碗拉面然后撇开视线。“在你开口问前，不，这不是巧合。不会，我不会告诉你我是怎么知道你在这的。我的工作就是掌握比你更多的情报。”\n"
"你告诉她你很高兴看到她依然这么难搞，她的嘴角露出一丝微笑。“亲近产生怠惰，所以我们还是保持公事公办吧。告诉我你目前调查到的事。”你担心的看了一眼周遭的人群，调查官摇摇头说：“我帮你确认过没有人跟踪了，说吧。”你的目光飘向她腰间的枪，希望她接下来不要过于刺探你的隐私。\n"
"你边搅动热气腾腾的拉面边告诉她目前为止的收获。雨势越来越大，混合著烤肉跟香料的香味，你瞄见人群中有一丝红色闪过，但仔细一看，那不过是一个红色风扇的倒影。调查官弹了一下手指示意你继续。当你报告完后，泰勒起身并结帐。\n"
"“你目前的表现，怎么说呢，合格了？”她认真的说。“但基石有另一项任务要交给你。我们需要你将一份档案送去位于拉哥斯的机密地点。请保证它安全送达。”她交给你一份用细绳系起的文件。"

msgid "Threading your way through crowded streets, you meet a shrouded figure in a back alley. Reciting a phrase written in your instructions, you whisper: “Six lions prowl at dusk.” The figure lowers the brim of their hat and recites the callback: “A pride feasts in darkness.” Relaxing your guard, you hand the Foundation operative the documents, and they retreat into the shadows."
msgstr "你钻过拥挤的街道，在暗巷跟一个身影会面。你低声说出指示上的暗语：“六只狮子于黄昏狩猎”，那个身影拉下帽沿说出回应：“黑暗中的傲人飨宴”。你放下戒备，将文件交给他。接著他就退回暗影了之中。"
