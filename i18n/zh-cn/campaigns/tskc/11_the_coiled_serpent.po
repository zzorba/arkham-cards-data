"You send a missive to Agent Flint ahead of your arrival, setting a meeting place and time—Jing’an Temple at noon. —and head there as soon as you arrive, entering the broad stone courtyard at the temple’s entrance. After a short while, a tourist approaches you and asks in English: “You’re sure you’re alone?” It takes you a moment to realize that the tourist is none other than Flint, in a subtle yet convincing disguise. He narrows his eyes at your stare. “Answer me,” he says, scanning his surroundings.\n"
"You assure him that you haven’t been followed. “Can’t be too careful. Eyes everywhere. I have a lead on one of those Coterie types here in Shanghai, just like the Foundation’s intel suggested. They call her ‘subject #46–Q,’ aka ‘Lady with Red Parasol.’ Sure enough, she brings that parasol everywhere she goes. As far as Coterie insignias go, it’s not the most subtle.” While he whispers, he pulls a large camera and tripod from his duffel bag and painstakingly sets up a shot of the temple.\n"
"You wonder aloud what in the world Flint is up to. “Stop staring,” he hisses under his breath. Then you spot other tourists taking photos as well, and you realize that Flint is better at blending in than you are. “The last time I saw the lady with the parasol, she was leaving a meeting between several wealthy British and Chinese businessmen—railway men,” he says quietly, head still down. “Women aren’t usually allowed at such meetings. Nor are regular citizens. To be in that room, you have to be able to get the attention of those powerful men. Which means you’re either very powerful, or obscenely wealthy.” Flint takes a few photos, then moves to a new spot and starts the tedious process of focusing the camera all over again. “Within two weeks of that meeting, they announced a lucrative new contract. It seems all their competitors were convinced for one reason or another to step away from the project, which left them to write their own ticket. Name their own price.” He slowly scans the courtyard again, careful to move just his eyes and not his head. “Could be she has leverage on them. Or maybe she’s just that charming. But I’m willing to put my money on it being the influence of a Key. If that’s true, it’s imperative that we’re not made.” Flint’s paranoia is infectious."

"你在抵达前送了一则讯息给弗林特，约他中午在静安寺见面。你一抵达就直接前往那里。你在寺庙前的石板广场等待了一阵子，突然一名游客靠近用英文问你：“你确定没有被跟踪吗？”片刻后你才反应过来他就是弗林特，他做了一点伪装。他瞇起眼对上你的视线说：“回答我。”一边扫视周围。\n"
"你向他保证没人跟踪你。“小心为上，到处都有眼线。我照著基石的情报在上海追查到一个结社成员。他们称她为‘目标#46-Q’或‘红伞女子’，她的阳伞从不离身，也许是结社的身份象征吧，她并没有要隐藏的意思。”他边低语著，边从旅行包中拿出相机与脚架，艰难的架起相机对著寺庙。\n"
"你对弗林特的行为感到不解。“不要一直盯著看。”弗林特嘘了你一声。你发现有很多其他观光客也在照相，才发觉弗林特比你更认真在融入环境。“我最近一次看到那个女人是在一场会议结束时，她跟几个英国和中国的铁路大亨一起走出来。”他低著头安静的说，“那种会议通常都不让女人参与，也不会有一般民众。要参加那场会议，必须入得了那些大亨的眼，换句话说，你得要很有权力，不然就得很有钱。”弗林特照了几张相后移动到另一个地点，重复麻烦的架设过程。“会议两周后，他们公开了一份收益丰厚的合约。看来因为所有竞争者都被说服让步，所以他们可以自己制定规则跟价格。”他再次扫视广场，但小心地不转头，只动眼睛。“她一定对他们动了什么手脚，也可能是她真的有足够的魅力。但我敢打赌一定是密钥的影响，如果真是这样，我们要极度小心不要被控制。”你也开始被弗林特的疑神疑鬼感染了。"

msgid "Look, I would tell you more, maybe even let you help me out here, but you’ve made it pretty clear you’re a bit chatty, and the last thing I need is the Coterie figuring out I’m on to them. So, how about we split up? Keep doing what you’re doing, and I’ll contact you when I have a good lead.” Without letting you protest, Flint packs up his camera and leaves."
msgstr "“听著，我会告诉你更多资讯，甚至可以让你帮我。但你已经证明自己不善于保密，而我不想让结社知道我在追查他们。所以，我们还是分开行动吧，你继续你的工作，当我查到有力线索后会联络你。”你还来不及反对他就带著相机离开了。"

msgstr "如果剩余的时间少于6，则改为将“ψ”标记在“经过的时间”的最终格子中。"

msgid "“It will take some time to learn more about her and find the right opportunity to apprehend her,” Flint says quietly. “I saw how you acted with Taylor. I trust you to be discreet. So, I’ll contact you when I have a good lead. Or, I suppose you could stay and aid my investigation here.”"
msgstr "“要取得更多情报跟找到好时机跟她接触会需要一点时间。”弗林特静静的说，“你在泰勒面前的表现让我相信你是能够保密的。所以，当我查到有力线索后会联络你；或是你可以帮我一起进行调查。”"

msgid "“Happy hunting, then,” Flint says with a nod. He hands you a slip of paper with his hotel, room number, and alias scribbled down on it. “In case you need to get in touch. I’ll send you a telegram when I know more. At least your travel expenses are on government dime, right?”"
msgstr "弗林特点头说：“狩猎愉快。”他递给你一张写著他的饭店、房间号码跟假名的纸条。“以防你需要联络我。我有更多消息后会发电报给你。至少你的旅费可以报帐对吧？”"

msgid "Over the course of several weeks, you manage to strike up a relationship with some of your quarry’s business associates—titans of industry in the fields of mining and railroad construction. You bide your time, earning a bit of their confidence, and it isn’t long before they mention the lady with the red parasol, whom they call Tzu San Niang. Her silver tongue and negotiating skills are apparently the thing of legend. One remarks, with a dreadful laugh, of her ability to convince worker unions to tolerate abysmal conditions, and local governments to accept the extraction of natural resources without batting an eye. Under the guise of needing her help for a project, you inquire about how to contact her. Your contacts inform you that she’s just landed a deal in Hong Kong and is already on her way there."
msgstr "经过几周的调查，你终于跟几个你猎物的关系人建立了联系，他们都是铁路或矿业的大亨。你花了点时间赢得他们的信任，不久他们就提到了拿红阳伞的女子，他们叫她梓三娘。她的巧舌如簧跟精湛的谈判技巧堪称传奇。其中一个人边奸笑著边回忆起她说服工会接受苛刻的条件，还有政府机关连眼睛都没眨一下，就接受了无节制开发自然资源的计划。你以自己的项目需要她帮忙做为伪装，询问要如何与她连络。你的联络人告诉你她在香港有一个案子要谈，她已经动身出发了。"

msgstr "在剧本日志中的东南亚部分，找出香港。在该空格上标记“50−S”，每当你启程时可以旅行到香港了。"

msgid "Flint gives you a frustrated look. “Really? After all this work?” You explain to him that if the lady with the red parasol is as elusive and dangerous as she seems, it might be more prudent to work on other, more pressing cases. “I suppose you might have a point. Seems like a waste, though. I’ll make sure to report in with the Commissioner so she’s aware of what’s going on here, though. Maybe they can send somebody else to…” he trails off, then shakes his head. “Nah. They’d just muck it up.”"
msgstr "弗林特看起来很挫折。“真的吗？在努力这么久之后？”你跟他解释如果红伞女子跟看起来一样危险而难对付，那也许把精力放在其他更急迫的目标上会比较好。“我想你是对的，虽然感觉很可惜。我会向调查官报告这里的事情，也许他们会派其他人来……”他停顿了一下，然后摇了摇头。“算了。他们只会搞得更糟。”"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record <i>Flint abandoned his search</i>. Any one investigator may choose to add the Inspector Flint story asset to their deck. It does not count toward their deck size. This card can be found in the <i>Globetrotting</i> encounter set."
