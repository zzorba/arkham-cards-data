"After some searching, you find Dr. Irawan in the Belmond Copacabana seated at a table covered in sketches and academic clutter. “I am actually glad you missed my lecture,” she says. “It was an utter disaster. I was laughed out of the auditorium when I tried to present. Someone called me a ‘cryptozoologist’.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan adjusts her large round spectacles as she turns to a beautifully detailed sketch of a bird roosting in a palm tree. “I presented what I am calling the Theory of Annihilation. A process by which an ecosystem is, itself, devoured via what you have dubbed ‘paranatural selection.’ Not just the ecosystem, but the memory of itself. The fact of its very existence.”\n"
"“Do not worry, I will credit you for that term,” she takes a sip of strong, dark coffee. “But after my recent survey of the Amazon, I am afraid the process is accelerating. A dozen species of macaw have vanished, and my colleagues have no memory of them. The sketches have disappeared as well. Of those we documented, only the scarlet macaw remains.”\n"
"As Dr. Irawan flips idly through her sketchbook, her eyes catch on a particular page, and her face goes white. “This cannot be.”\n"
"You ask her what the matter is, and she points to the page. “Just yesterday, this page was not blank. The <i>Phalanger septimus</i>. A cuscus living in the western New Guinea.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan begins gathering up her things. “I sketched this subject months ago. Perhaps there will be some trace of it—or of whatever force is behind all this—out in Manokwari.” She pushes a strand of hair behind her ear and smiles at you. “Thank you for listening. Perhaps we will meet again.”"

"在做了一些调查后，你在贝尔蒙德科帕卡巴纳饭店找到了伊拉万博士，她坐在一张散落著笔记、草稿跟其他学术用品的桌子后。“我很庆幸你错过了我的讲座，那真是天大的灾难。我发表的东西遭到所有人的嘲笑，有些人甚至叫我‘独角兽学家’。”\n"
"伊拉万博士推了推她的圆框眼镜，指向一张精美的素描，上面画著一只鸟栖息在棕榈树上。“我发表了一个我称为湮灭理论的假设。生态系会被你所谓的‘悖常天择’吞噬，不只是生态系本身，而是记忆都一起被吞噬，抹除一切存在的证据。”\n"
"“别担心，我会标记那个词的出处的。”她喝了一口苦涩的黑咖啡。“恐怕这个状况在我从亚马逊调查回来后正在加速发生。十几种金刚鹦鹉已经消失了，而我的同事们对牠们毫无记忆，素描也都消失了。在我们记录到的种类中，只有绯红金刚鹦鹉还存在。”\n"
"伊拉万博士随意的翻著她的素描本，但在翻到某一页时，她的脸色瞬间变白。“这不可能啊。”\n"
"你问发生了什么事，她指著那页说：“它昨天还不是空白的，赛提米乌斯貂，一种生活在新几内亚西部的袋貂。”\n"
"伊拉万博士开始收拾东西。“我几个月前才画下这份素描。也许在曼洛瓦里会有造成这一切元凶的线索。”她将一丝头发拨到耳后对你说：“感谢你的聆听，也许我们会再见面。”"

"After some searching, you find Dr. Irawan in the Belmond Copacabana seated at a table covered in sketches and academic clutter. After introducing yourself, you ask about her research.\n"
"“Oh, I see. You are here to mock me,” she says, closing a worn survey journal. You tell her you aren’t, and after some coaxing, she opens up to you. “I am actually glad you missed my lecture,” she says. “It was an utter disaster. I was laughed out of the auditorium when I tried to present. Someone called me a ‘cryptozoologist’.”\n"
"You tell her that there are worse insults. “That may be,” Dr. Irawan adjusts her large round spectacles. “But for my career, it is a death knell.” She turns to a beautifully detailed sketch of a bird roosting in a palm tree. “I presented what I am calling the Theory of Annihilation. The world devouring itself. Not just itself, but the memory of itself. The fact of its very existence.”\n"
"She takes a sip of strong, dark coffee. “Several years ago, I surveyed the Amazon with a half dozen other well-known academics. We observed dozens of distinct species of macaw, and named each after a stone: turquoise, amethyst, obsidian, the like. But now,” she turns to several empty pages. “There is no trace or record of any of them. My colleagues tell me I made up the Turquoise Macaw and the others. There is no trace of them in their habitat, either. And the sketches have disappeared as well.”\n"
"You assure Dr. Irawan that she is not mad, and share what little you can about the disappearances.\n"
"“Thank you,” says Dr. Irawan. “I am glad we met. I was beginning to think this was all in my head.” She gives you her business card with the address of a university in Australia written on the back. “I will be in Perth to continue my survey and my next lecture. Perhaps I will see you there.”"

"在做了一些调查后，你在贝尔蒙德科帕卡巴纳饭店找到了伊拉万博士，她坐在一张散落著笔记、草稿跟其他学术用品的桌子后。你自我介绍后，询问她正在进行的研究。\n"
"“喔，我懂了，你也是来嘲笑我的。”她重重阖上磨损严重的旅行笔记。你告诉她不是这样，经过一阵安抚后，她终于愿意开口。“我很庆幸你错过了我的讲座，那真是天大的灾难。我发表的东西遭到所有人的嘲笑，有些人甚至叫我‘独角兽学家’。”\n"
"你安慰她说你听过很多更糟糕的词。“可能吧。”伊拉万博士推了推她的圆框眼镜。“但在我的领域里，这跟宣判死刑没两样。”她指向一张精美的素描，上面画著一只鸟栖息在棕榈树上。“我发表了一个我称为湮灭理论的假设。世界会自我吞噬，不只是本身，而是连记忆都一起被吞噬，抹除一切存在的证据。”\n"
"她喝了一口苦涩的黑咖啡。“几年前，我跟六个知名的学者一起前往亚马逊进行调查。我们观察到数种独特的金刚鹦鹉，我们用矿物为牠们命名：绿松石、紫水晶、黑曜岩之类的。但现在，”她翻到几页空白页，“相关的记录都不见了，我的同事说牠们都是我捏造出来的。在牠们原本的栖息地也不见牠们的踪影，素描也全都消失了。”\n"
"你向伊拉万博士保证她没有疯，并分享了一些你对于消失事件的所见所闻。\n"
"“谢谢你。”伊拉万博士说。“很高兴认识你，我差点开始以为这一切都是幻觉了。”她给了你一张名片，背后是一间澳洲大学的地址。“我会在伯斯继续研究跟准备下一次发表，也许你可以到那跟我碰面。”"
