msgid "You are jolted awake by the sound of screeching wheels as your train shudders to a stop. Although it is barely morning, the heat from the sun rises in shimmering waves from the sweltering pavement to veil Marrakesh in an otherworldly glimmer. Your head pounds. The city wavers like a mirage in the middle of the Moroccan desert."
msgstr "你被火车减速的尖锐摩擦声惊醒。尽管早晨才刚刚来临，炙热的太阳已经用热浪为马拉喀什蒙上了一片闪烁的面纱。整座城市看起来像摩洛哥沙漠中的海市蜃楼般摇曳著。"

"You meet your contact on the rooftop of a small cafe not far from the railway station. The man’s boyish frame is offset by a well-kempt grey beard that covers deep laugh lines. “You must be with the Foundation,” he extends a hand to shake. “I am Latif. Please, sit. You must be hungry.”\n"
"The table is laden with bowls and dishes heaped with eggs, olives, and rich cheese served with flat bread and hot atay. As you eat, Latif spreads a stack of newspapers on the table between you. “I don’t want to ruin your appetite, my friends, but there is some wicked purpose at work in the city.” He points out three different headlines:\n"
"<center><typewriter>MYSTERIOUS TOMB ROBBERY</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>SUDDEN BLIGHT DEVASTATES OLIVE GROVE</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>DOZENS MISSING IN MEDINA</typewriter></center>\n"
"A warm, pungent breeze wafts over you, rustling the newspaper. Latif whispers conspiratorially, “I assume you read the dossier. The one who calls herself Amaranth was seen here, and I believe she is responsible.” Looking over his shoulder, the middle-aged man produces a crisp photo of a beautiful 20-something woman in a black dress and matching gloves, a gaudy blossom tucked behind her ear.\n"
"“Just last night, I sent my contact to gather any information he could on her whereabouts. He hasn’t returned. I fear the worst,” Latif says, looking downcast. “But that is why you’re here, I suppose! The commissioner always sends such…” he looks at you as if considering his words. “Unique people.”\n"
"You assure Latif that you may be new to the Foundation, but that you are more than capable of handling the situation.\n"
"“I truly hope so,” says Latif, drinking deep from his cup of hot mint tea. “There is something strange happening here. My brother told me he saw our late grandfather walking the street in his burial shroud. I told him that he must have been dreaming, but I have heard similar stories. It is not safe to walk the streets at night anymore. I believe there is some terrible sorcery at work. Some unnatural influence. If only the Foundation did not redact their own missives!”\n"
"You spend the rest of the morning reviewing the bundle of newspapers and scrivenings Latif has collected. The first “tomb robbery” reported in the recent string of events was of Razin Farhi, a 16th-century philosopher and mathematician. “It is rumored that he was one of the founding members of the Red Coterie,” Latif tells you. Your mind races as you try to piece the information together: is Amaranth after another Key?\n"
"“Whatever is happening, we cannot afford to wait idly,” Latif says."

"你与联络人在离火车站不远的一家咖啡厅顶楼见面。男人藏著微笑的灰色胡子平衡了他稚气的长相。“你一定是基石派来的。我叫拉提夫。请坐，你一定饿了。”他边向你伸出手边介绍。\n"
"桌上摆满了装满蛋跟橄榄的碗，还有各式各样的乳酪跟扁面包，一旁放著一壶热薄荷茶。当你用餐时，拉提夫将一叠报纸放到桌上。“我不想影响你的食欲，但邪恶的阴谋正在这个城市中进行。”他边说边指向三个不同的标题。\n"
"<center><typewriter>神秘盗墓行动</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>橄榄园无故枯萎</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>麦地那数十人失踪</typewriter></center>\n"
"一阵炎热刺人的微风拂过，吹乱了报纸。拉提夫低语著：“我想你已经读过卷宗了。那名自称永生花的女性在这里，我认为她是始作俑者。”这位中年男子扫视一下四周后，拿出了一张脆弱的照片，上面是一个20多岁的美丽女性，穿著黑色洋装跟黑色手套，耳边戴著一朵艳丽的花朵。\n"
"“就在昨晚，我派了一个线人去搜集关于她的情报。但他还没回来，恐怕要做最坏的打算。”拉提夫低头说到。“但我相信这就是你来到这的原因！调查官总是会派遣像你一样……”他打量了你一下，思索著适当的用词。“一样特别的人来。”\n"
"你跟拉提夫保证，虽然你是新加入基石的人，但你绝对有能力处理这个事件。\n"
"“我衷心的期望。”拉提夫喝了一口热薄荷茶。“这里正发生奇怪的事，我弟弟说他看见我们过世的祖父身著寿衣在街上游荡，我说他一定是在作梦，但我听到许多类似的故事。夜晚的街道已经不再安全了，有某种巫术正在流窜，一种不自然的力量。如果基石没有删改档案就好了！”\n"
"你整个早上都在阅览报纸跟听取拉提夫搜集的情资。一系列“盗墓案”中的第一件发生在拉金·法尔希的陵墓，一位16世纪的哲学家与数学家。拉提夫说：“有传言说他是绯红结社的创始成员之一。”你的思绪飞快的试著将所有情报拼凑起来：永生花是否在寻找另一个密钥呢？\n"
"“无论眼下正在发生什么，我们都必须立刻行动。”拉提夫说到。"

"There are no cabs to hail outside the railway station, so you walk to meet your contact on the rooftop of a near-empty cafe. The man who greets you has a boyish frame offset by a well-kempt beard that covers deep laugh lines. However, he is not smiling. “You’re late,” he says gravely. “I sent a telegram to the Foundation requesting assistance. We are in dire straits, as you say.”\n"
"You apologize and tell him you’ve done the best you can, and he rubs his brow worriedly. “I am sorry. It is good you are here, but I fear that things are set in motion already. Things we no longer have the time nor power to stop.” He gestures for you to sit. “I am Latif. Please. You will want to sit down for this.”\n"
"A spread of tempting local delicacies has been laid out on the table, but judging from the spare remnants, Latif ate most of it due to nerves. He shows you several newspapers in turn with headlines detailing desecrated tombs, dying crops, and numerous missing persons reports. As he relays these sobering events to you, you catch a scent of something foul on the wind. Looking out across the city, you see a pattern of inky black vines that run across building façades. At a distance, they look like raised veins on a dying body.\n"
"“My friend?” Latif’s voice breaks through your reverie. You apologize, and ask him about the vines. The middle-aged man sighs. “Yet another mystery, it seems. Last night, there was a great commotion outside Bahia Palace. Screaming and gnashing teeth. I sent one of my informants to investigate and he never returned. Soon after, the strange black blooms appeared, growing on every wall and surface. They stink of rot and produce awful, sharp thorns. I wouldn’t dare touch them.”\n"
"“Before this strange business began, my brother told me he saw our late grandfather walking the street in his burial shroud. I would have dismissed it but for the dozens of similar stories. There are now crowds of slow-moving, silent people walking the streets. Their eyes are empty, though their bellies are not,” Latif says bitterly, then drains the rest of his teacup.\n"
"“I believe the one who calls herself Amaranth is responsible. You might recognize her from the Foundation’s dossier. How helpful that they blot out the most important details in their own missives!” Latif produces a crisp photo of a beautiful 20-something woman in a black dress and matching gloves, a gaudy blossom tucked behind her ear.\n"
"“Another of my informants said he saw this ‘Amaranth’ at the Bahia Palace Gardens. Some strange work is afoot, and she is at the center of it. I say we go to the palace and put a stop to whatever awful plans she has in place, but be ready for anything.”\n"
"You catch a now-familiar scent of rot on the wind, and look down to the lip of the rooftop cafe. A single, black tendril has crept up the side of the building. At the end of the vine, a bulbous, black fruiting body has begun to develop. You aren’t sure if it is a trick of the late morning sun, or if there is some other strange process at work, but you could swear you see a shimmer of phosphorescent green flash along the body, and a noticeable movement, though there is no wind."

"你在火车站外招不到计程车，只好步行到一间空荡咖啡厅的顶楼与你的联络人会面。等待著你的是一名男性，他灰色的胡子平衡了他稚气的长相，但在他脸上看不见笑容。他严肃的说：“你来迟了，我发了电报给基石请求援助。如你所见，这里情况非常不乐观。”\n"
"你向他道歉并表示你已经尽快赶来了。他忧虑的搓揉著眼角：“我很抱歉，我很高兴你来了，但恐怕情况已经失控了，我们已经没有力量跟时间阻止了。”他示意要你入座。“我叫拉提夫，你会想坐下再听的。”\n"
"桌子上放满了当地传统的佳肴，但就剩余的情况来看，大部分都被焦虑的拉提夫吃掉了。他给了你几份报纸头条，内容关于被亵渎的墓穴、枯死的作物跟失踪的人口。当他将这些悲剧事件之间的关联解释给你听时，你闻到风中飘来一股恶臭。你向外看向城市，墨汁般黑色的藤蔓爬满了建筑物的外墙，远远看去就像尸体上浮肿的血管。\n"
"“我的朋友？”拉提夫的声音将你从出神状态拉回现实。你向他道歉并问到那些藤蔓。这位中年男子叹了口气说：“这是另一个谜团，昨晚在巴西亚宫外有阵很大的骚动。尖叫声跟咆啸声此起彼落，我派了人去查看，但他一去不回了。很快那些黑色的花就出现了，长满了整座城市，散发著腐败的恶臭，还长出尖锐的荆棘，我不敢碰触它们。”\n"
"“在这个事件爆发前，我弟弟说他看见我们的祖父穿著寿衣在街上游荡，我本想忽略，但有越来越多的相似报告传来。他们现在在街上沉默而缓慢的游荡，眼神空洞但饥饿无比。”拉提夫语带苦涩，仰头饮尽最后一点薄荷茶。\n"
"“我相信幕后黑手是自称永生花的那名女性，你应该看过她的卷宗了，基石把所有最重要的地方抹除了可真是帮了大忙！”拉提夫拿出了一张脆弱的照片，上面是一个20多岁的漂亮女性，穿著黑色洋装跟黑色手套，耳边戴著一朵艳丽的花朵。\n"
"“我的另一个线人说他在巴西亚宫花园看到了‘永生花’，她就是这一团混乱的中心。我说我们直接冲进皇宫阻止她的计划吧，但做好面对任何状况的准备。”\n"
"你闻到一股熟悉的臭味，你从屋顶向下望，看见一小段黑色的蔓须已经爬上这栋建筑了，在藤蔓的源头有一颗黑色的花苞正在生长。你不确定是光线的关系还是真的有什么超自然的力量，但你发誓花苞周围有绿色的，如鬼火般的闪光正在移动，即使现在一点风都没有。"

"A scent of smoke and decay greets you as you step off the train. You are one of just a handful of people to emerge onto the empty platform of the railway station. Black, dessicated vines climb up the sides of the surrounding buildings and end in riotous red flowers. An eerie silence hangs over everything.\n"
"On your way to meet your contact, you pass a few, scattered people who walk with a halting, awkward gait. Several of them reach out to you as you keep a wide berth, and you see their skin is jaundiced and dry, and their eyes have a hollow, empty look. A cloud of flies follows in their wake, buzzing incessantly. You are hardly surprised when you find the door to the cafe where you were supposed to meet a “Latif” boarded up.\n"
"Tarry death blooms on the walls and storefronts, all hastily barricaded. Fearful eyes peer out at you from between slatted boards. Marrakesh is in utter ruin. After wandering the city, you find the epicenter of the strange black vines lies in the pulverized remains of Bahia Palace. In the overgrown gardens, you find the remnants of a strange ritual, but no trace of those who conducted it."

"你踏出车厢的同时就闻到一股腐臭的烟味。空荡荡的月台上只有寥寥几人，黑色干枯的藤蔓爬满周遭的建筑物，妖艳的红花却盛放在藤蔓末端。诡异的寂静笼罩著一切。\n"
"在你前往与联络人会面的路上，你经过几名步履蹒跚、姿势诡异的行人。有些人朝你靠近，你则试著保持距离，他们的皮肤不自然的泛黄且干裂，恼人的苍蝇在他们头上盘旋。你终于找到了那间咖啡厅的大门，你应该要在顶楼跟一名叫做“拉提夫”的人会面。\n"
"代表死亡的花朵盛放在墙上跟门口。透过匆促用木板封死的门窗，你看到一双双充满恐惧的眼睛，马拉喀什已毁于一旦。你在巴西亚宫的遗址找到了那些黑色藤蔓的中心，在花园中你发现了施行仪式的痕迹，但罪魁祸首已不知去向。"

"Looking down at the woman who called herself Amaranth, you call her by her true name. “Eryn… Cochwyn?” She holds her hand to her cheek as her cheeks flush. You see her eyes dilate as she begins to remember her former life. As her gaze passes over the Last Blossom writhing in your hand, she lets out a cry of horror. “I had the most terrible dream,” she says. “I dreamt I was a great and terrible queen, and that I ruled over a kingdom of silent subjects.” Realizing what she has done, the change in Eryn’s demeanor is jarring. The woman who seemed so heartless and cruel now lies before you, weeping.\n"
"It is clear to you that Eryn’s actions were not her own. You console her and lead her to safety along with the rest of the survivors, telling her that you will keep the blossom safe and prevent ‘Amaranth’ from taking another host ever again. “Never again,” she echoes your words. “Never again.” As you depart, the blossom furls and unfurls, as if searching for another host."
