"Gulls cry out as you cross the Galata Bridge: what many would call the link between the traditional city of Constantinople, and the districts of Galata, Beyoğlu, Şişli and Harbiye, where a large proportion of foreign merchants and diplomats live and work. Since you know where you are headed, and time and secrecy are of the essence, you decide against hiring a translator, and head directly to the Süleymaniye Complex, where the target of your investigation—a Ms. Ece Şahin—supposedly works.\n"
"Ms. Şahin has made a name for herself in several fields of academia, specifically in the fields of antiquity and art history. According to your intel, she works as a curator in the recently established Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, but to your surprise, your case files include a wealth of other information about Ms. Şahin, from her schooling all the way back to her early life. All of this points to one of two conclusions: either she is not in hiding like the other members of the Coterie, or she has crafted an extensive cover story.\n"
"According to your intel, Ms. Şahin has already reached out to the Foundation by way of an offer of introduction. It could be a trap, but if she truly wishes to meet, you can’t turn down such an opportunity. Thankfully, her office is not difficult to find, the door marked with her name and full title in Turkish and several other languages. You knock and she bids you to enter, which you do with much caution, eyes instinctively darting to every one of the room’s corners and hiding places.\n"
"The room is warm and richly decorated, the walls covered in beautiful tapestries and paintings of many styles ranging from hundreds of years old to very recent, and shelves filled to the brim with a variety of colorful ceramics, glassware, and old, musty texts. “Greetings,” Ms. Şahin says with a warm smile that seems to brighten the room. She is a young woman with dark tan skin, hazel eyes, and the wispy figure of one who has spent her entire life in academia. “What can I do for you?”\n"
"You inform Ms. Şahin that you received her “earlier communication” and her desire to meet with you, which she takes a moment to interpret before her eyes go wide.\n"
"“Oh! So you are—” she clears her throat and does not finish that train of thought. “I see. Then, in that case, please, sit down. We have much to discuss.”\n"
"You tell Ms. Şahin that she can start by explaining her involvement with the Coterie. Your eyes catch her shifting uncomfortably in her seat at the mention of the organization’s name.\n"
"“The Coterie is involved with a great many things all over the world, as you likely already know,” she says, choosing each word delicately, “but their—our—goals are not so different from your own. I have spent many years as a researcher for the organization, searching for the very same things your employers seek. Objects of arcane power that can be used to defend humanity from the threats we cannot see.”"

"海鸥在你走过加拉塔桥时在空中鸣叫，这座桥梁连接了君士坦丁堡的旧城区与加拉塔、贝伊奥卢、希什利跟哈尔比耶这些较现代化的区域，大多数外国商人及外交人员都在这几个区域生活与工作。你已经知道目的地，而且时间跟隐密性非常关键，所以你决定不雇用翻译，迳直前往苏莱曼尼耶清真寺，你的目标——艾洁·沙辛女士应该在那工作。\n"
"沙辛女士在数个学术领域都饱负盛名，尤其是在文物及艺术史的方面。根据你的情报，她目前在新成立的土耳其及伊斯兰艺术博物馆担任馆长。你很惊讶关于她的资料如此巨细靡遗，从她求学时期到她早年的生活都有记录。这只有两个可能性：她要不是没有像其他结社成员一样神秘；就是她假造了一个几可乱真的背景。\n"
"根据报告，沙辛女士主动与基石联络，提供会面的机会。这可能是陷阱，但如果她是真心想会面，你不能放过这次机会。幸运的是她的办公室不难找，门上用土耳其文及其他语言写著她的完整职称。你敲门并听到她说请进，你小心翼翼推开门，眼睛下意识地瞄向房间里每个角落跟可能藏身的地方。\n"
"房间很温暖，充满了各种装饰，墙上挂满了美丽的挂毯跟画作，从古老到现代一应俱全，架上放著五颜六色的陶罐、玻璃瓶跟发霉的书籍。“你好。”沙辛女士带著一个足以点亮房间的笑容招呼你。她是一位深色皮肤的年轻女性，有著绿褐色的眼睛，散发出资深学者的气质。“我可以为你做什么？”\n"
"你告诉她你们收到她先前的“联络”，说她想与你们会面。当她理解过来后瞳孔随之放大。\n"
"“哦！所以你是——”她清了清喉咙，没有将话说完。“我了解了，请坐。我们有很多东西要讨论。”\n"
"你告诉沙辛女士可以从她与结社有何关联开始解释，你注意到当你提到这个组织的名称时，她不自在的动了一下。\n"
"“结社在世界各地都有行动在进行，但这你应该已经知道了。”她小心翼翼的选择适当的用词。“但他们——我们的目的跟你们没有太大不同。我担任组织的研究员许多年，找寻著跟你们一样的东西：那些具有法力的物件。利用它们来保护人类免于不可见的威胁。”"

"Or to control humanity, you note aloud.\n"
"Ms. Şahin sighs. “You are not wrong. But I assure you not all of us within the Coterie would use them for such purposes. There are those, like myself, who wish only to use them for the good of others.”\n"
"You ask Ms. Şahin why you should trust her, given the actions of the Coterie in other places around the world.\n"
"“Ours is not an organization with a leader or a hierarchy,” she explains. “We operate independently in furtherance of a unified goal. But some…” she swallows hard with a shudder. “Some employ methods I do not agree with. Methods which disgust and, if I am being wholly honest, terrify me.”\n"
"You still don’t know if Ms. Şahin is telling the truth, but there’s no point in not hearing her out. You ask her what the situation in Constantinople is, and why she has sought an audience with the Foundation. “Istanbul,” she corrects you. “The people of Istanbul no longer refer to this city by that name.” You make a note to yourself to refer to the city only as Istanbul from here on out. “One of the relics you have been searching for is here, in Istanbul. It is one I have been seeking for many years, a talisman bound to a powerful entity, what some might call a ‘jinni.’ Or in the traditional sense, the only kind of non-human entity with the capability to exercise free will.”\n"
"Judging from Ms. Şahin’s clinical definition, you wonder aloud if Ms. Şahin believes this to be true. “A jinni? No, I do not believe this talisman is bound to a jinni. I suspect its master is something even more powerful and inhuman. Something not of Earth at all. And the two of us are not the only ones looking for it. After the Great War and the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire, many records were thrown into chaos, but many more emerged from obscurity, including those pertaining to this talisman. The other group searching for it… the things they have done in search of this knowledge…” her face pales, and she struggles to keep her composure. “They’ll do anything to get their hands on it. Murder and torture are just tools to them. I hate to think of what sort of heinous acts these villains would commit if they managed to obtain it. And the worst part is, I believe one of my cohorts may be the one pulling the strings. I am so close to finding it, but if they find it first…”\n"
"You understand now why Ms. Şahin came to you—if one of the Coterie is behind this cult’s actions, she could not go to them with this information. Still, lingering doubt toils in your mind. “Please,” she pleads with you. “Find the talisman before this cult does. I do not wish to see what entity it is they worship. I’ll do what I can to help you if you place the talisman into my care afterward. In return, I promise never to relinquish it to the control of the other… more dangerous members of my organization. It will remain safe and tethered in my control. I cannot guarantee the same should you wield it yourself. Please, we are on the same side, I assure you.”"

"或是支配人类，你补充到。\n"
"沙辛女士叹了口气。“你说的没错。但我保证不是每个结社成员都想这样做。有些人，包括我，只想用它们造福他人。”\n"
"你问她自己为什么要相信她，毕竟结社成员在世界上其他地方做了那种事。\n"
"她解释道：“我们不是一个有领袖或统治阶层的组织。我们各自独立行动，为了一个共通的目标努力。但有些人……”她冷颤著咽下一口口水：“我不同意他们的做法。他们的手段非常恶心，而且坦白说，令我恐惧。”\n"
"你依然不知道该不该信任她，但不利用她的情报就太傻了。你询问目前君士坦丁堡有什么状况，还有她为什么要找上基石。“伊斯坦堡。”她纠正你。“这里的人民已经不再用那个名字了。”你暗自记下这件事。“其中一样你们搜寻的物件就在这里，在伊斯坦堡。我已经追查它好几年了，它是一个护符，里面束缚著力量强大的灵体，有些人会叫祂‘精灵’。在传说跟故事中，这是一种拥有自由意志的非人类灵体。”\n"
"她轻蔑的解释令你感觉她不是真的相信精灵的说法。“精灵？不，我不认为这个护符里住著精灵。我怀疑它的主人是更强大的存在，不属于人类，甚至不属于地球。而且不只我们两个在找它，在大战过后，奥斯曼帝国瓦解，许多记录在混乱中遗失了。但有更多从尘封的文献出现，其中就有关于护符的线索。有另一个团体在寻找它，他们以知识为名做出的事情……”她的脸色发白，努力想保持镇定，“他们不择手段想得到它，谋杀跟刑求对他们来说只是工具。我不愿去想像他们得到它后能做出什么更可怕的事。最糟的是，我认为有一位我的同志是幕后黑手。我就快找到它了，但如果他们抢先一步……”\n"
"你终于了解为什么沙辛女士会找上你们了，如果这个邪教背后有结社成员在操控，那她就不能冒险将情报透漏给结社内的人。但你依然对她抱持著怀疑。她请求你：“拜托，抢在他们之前找到护符。我会尽我所能帮助你，只要你答应将护符置于我的保护下。作为回报，我保证绝不会将它交给组织里其他……危险的成员中。我能维持护符的稳定，但如果你自己掌控的话，我不敢保证你能做到。拜托，我们是站在同一边的，我发誓。”"

"You ask Ms. Şahin where you should begin searching. “The last written account of the talisman’s existence was during the city’s conquest in the 15th century. It was likely hidden in order to keep the invading Ottomans from finding it. After that, it remained hidden for many long years. It was naught but a fable, spoken of in hushed voices and whispers. But due to recent events… well, it would not surprise me if the recent Allied occupation of the city had something to do with this sudden interest in finding it. But let us not get buried in conjecture. I would begin looking in places that were not sacked by the conquering army. The university may also be a useful resource for you.

msgstr "赢得艾洁的信任。"

msgid "Ece does not trust the cell."
msgstr "失去艾洁的信任。"

msgid "Once you and Ece are safely out of the city, you seal the talisman back in its case, speaking the proper words to contain its power. As you do, the uncanny eclipse looming over the city comes to a swift end."
msgstr "当你跟艾洁安全逃离城市后，你立刻将护符放回盒子中封存，念出正确的咒语来抑制它的力量，天空中异常的日蚀很快的消散了。"

msgid "You take a moment to look out over the sea and appreciate the beauty in the gentle waves, glimmering with the reflection of the now-shining sun. As you leave Istanbul behind, you allow yourself a bit of hope. Perhaps you could have trusted Ece more, but… you shake your head, filled with grim resolve. No—this relic is something you must protect yourself. Someone else might use it for ill. At least in your hands, you know it’s safe."
msgstr "海面在归来的阳光照射下闪闪发光，你花了片刻时间欣赏美丽的海洋与海浪。你终于成功离开伊斯坦堡，心中燃起一丝希望。也许你该多信任艾洁一点的，但是……抱著沉重的决心，你摇了摇头。不，这个物件必须由你自己保护。其他人可能会利用它从事邪恶的目的，至少在你手里你能确定它是安全的。"

msgid "Ece breathes an unsure sigh, worry still etched in her expression. “Well, in case they saw me, I should probably leave Istanbul for a short while. I’ll have to put in a leave of absence at the museum. In the meantime…” she turns to face you, eyebrows raised. “As for our agreement…?”"
msgstr "艾洁似乎还没松懈下来，她的表情写著担忧。“他们也许会认出我，看来我最好暂时离开伊斯坦堡，我得通知博物馆我将缺席一阵子。现在……”她转身面向你，挑起眉毛问道：“关于我们的协议……？”"

msgid "You hand over the talisman, trusting that Ece will keep it safe in her possession as promised. She breathes a sigh of relief as she stores it safely in her side pack. “Thank you. For trusting me,” she says. “I’ll keep it on my person at all times.” You take a moment to look out over the sea and appreciate the beauty in the gentle waves, glimmering with the reflection of the now-shining sun. Finally, you ask Ece where she will go now that her position in Istanbul is compromised. “There is a place where the Coterie meets in secret. To go over… important happenings. We do not consort often, but I believe these events warrant a caucus. I will have to call the rest to assemble.” She sneaks a furtive glance in your direction. “Perhaps, when that times comes, we will meet again.” As you leave Istanbul behind, you allow yourself a bit of hope."
msgstr "你交出护符，相信艾洁会保护好它，就像她承诺过的那样。她松了口气，将护符收进背包里。“谢谢你信任我。我会无时无刻带著它。”海面在归来的阳光照射下闪闪发光，你花了片刻时间欣赏美丽的海洋与海浪。终于，你问艾洁既然无法回到伊斯坦堡，她准备去哪里。她回答：“有一个结社秘密集会的场所，我们会在那里讨论……重要的议题。我们不常聚会，但我认为最近的事件必须召开会议进行讨论，我会连络其他人来集合。”她偷偷看了你一眼后说：“也许，当时机到来，我们会再见面。”当你终于成功离开伊斯坦堡时，心中燃起一丝希望。"

msgid "You lock eyes with Ece and apologize, explaining that you cannot give it to her. Especially after seeing the havoc it could wreak when unsealed. Her expression sours into cold anger. “I see.” She narrows her eyes. “…you had no intention of ever giving it to me,” she guesses correctly. You try to explain, but she stops you. “No, I understand. Really, I do.” She takes a step back, her posture wary, defensive. “You’re just like the others. You’ll do anything to get your hands on the Keys, won’t you?” You protest—it’s not that you want them for yourself, it’s just that you need to keep watch over them. In your possession, they’ll be safe, and only ever used to protect humanity. “And what do you suppose the rest of them say?” She barks. “Tzu? Amaranth? Álvarez? The very same. ‘It’s for the good of humanity,’ they claim, and to that end, all means are justified.” She turns and departs, her final words lingering in the air: “You would fit in nicely with the Coterie.” As you leave Istanbul behind, you reflect on your decision, turning the sealed case over and over in your hands. You know it was the right thing to do, but still, Ece’s words haunt you. Perhaps you’ll be able to reconcile some other time… if she’ll even hear you out."
msgstr "你带著抱歉的目光看著艾洁，解释你不能将护符交给她，尤其是在看到它解除封印后能带来什么灾难。她的脸色变的难看，充满冷冽的愤怒。她瞇起眼说：“我懂了，你从一开始就没打算交给我。”她猜中了，你试著解释，但被她打断。“不，我了解，真的。”她满怀戒备的向后退，“你就跟他们一样，不择手段就只为得到密钥对吧？”你抗议，你不是为了自己，只是为了保护它们。它们在你的看顾下会很安全，甚至能用来保护人类。“你以为他们不是这样说的吗？”艾洁吼到，“梓？永生花？阿瓦雷兹？他们都这样说，‘为了全人类的利益’，然后为此不择手段。”她转身离开留下最后一句话：“你跟结社会很合得来的。”当你终于离开伊斯坦堡，你不断翻转著封印的盒子，反思著你的决定。你知道自己是正确的，但艾洁的话在你心中盘旋不去。也许某天你们能够和解……如果她还愿意听你说话的话。"

msgid "You managed to find the location of the talisman, but the cult was one step ahead of you, swooping in and snatching it for themselves. Before you knew it, they had escaped the city with the entity unsealed. Who knows what horrors they’ve unleashed upon the world. You hope that some day the Foundation may be able to recover the talisman and prevent whatever entity it binds from causing too much harm, but until then… you shudder and put such thoughts away for the time being. If Ece was right about one of her cohorts being behind this cult’s actions, you’ll surely see the talisman again."
msgstr "你终于找到了护符的所在，但邪教成员抢先你抵达将其带走了。在你发觉前，他们已经解除了其中灵体的封印并离开了城市，没人知道他们释放了什么恐怖的存在到这世界上。你希望基石能在护符中的灵体造成重大破坏前取回护符。但现在你让自己暂时不去思考这件事，如果像艾洁说的，有结社成员在幕后操纵，那你一定会再见到这个护符。"
