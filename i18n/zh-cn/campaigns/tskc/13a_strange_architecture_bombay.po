msgstr "孟买"

msgid "The air is deliciously warm as you wait for a tram in southern Bombay. With several days until the next leg of your journey, you allow yourself to be drawn in by the city’s intoxicating color and light. A whirlwind first day sees you visit various temples, curio shops, and bazaars. Bright orange flowers hang by strings from bamboo racks as you make your way through a bazaar toward the Colaba Causeway, where the Gateway of India looks out onto the waterfront. As the day turns to evening, you continue to explore back alleys and side streets lit by delicately inlaid bronze lamps. The air is thick with unknown scents and hazy shapes as you lose yourself in the heady atmosphere of the old city. As you make your way to your hotel, you cross a wide thoroughfare into the Kala Ghoda district and stroll down its old, winding roads."
msgstr "你正在孟买南部等待著电车，宜人的气温让你全身舒畅。离你启程的时间还有几天，你允许自己暂时沉醉在这座城市迷人的色彩跟光线中。抵达的第一天你如旋风般拜访了许多不同的寺庙、古玩店跟市集。你走在铜锣湾商业街上，亮橘色的花朵摆满路边竹制的架子，在大街的尽头，著名的印度门瞭望著水面。天色渐渐转暗，你走入小路及巷弄中，青铜镶嵌的灯盏在路上投下精致的光影。不熟悉的芬芳与朦胧的光影让你陶醉在这座古老城市的氛围中。在你返回旅馆的路上，你走过卡拉哥达区的大道，转入一条古老的小路，风突然吹起。"

msgid "As you navigate the labyrinthine art district, you pass a familiar sight. Looking up, you see a narrow building with a slate façade, wide black windows, and unsettling accents. You have the distinct feeling you have been here before. You stand still for a moment as others pass you in the narrow street until you remember the same building in Stockholm. If not for the distinct, black windows and the harsh lines, you might not have remembered it. As you scan the façade, the frieze overhanging the door stands out to you. Where there were various recognizable figures before, you see odd, gangling facsimiles. The features are almost plastic; the smiles are too broad; the eyes seem to bulge. The number 13 is carved next to the door, same as in Stockholm. Curious, you step up and turn the doorknob, but it doesn’t budge. Knocking on the door produces virtually no sound. Although it looks like wood, it feels solid as concrete. Stopping a passer-by, you ask how long the building has been here. “This is an ancient place. These buildings have been here a long time,” they tell you. You find yourself questioning if the original you saw was even the original: how many other houses look just like this one in how many other cities? The building grows more foreboding the longer you look at it. A shudder courses up your spine, and you decide to leave the building alone."
msgstr "你穿越迷宫般的小路时，抬头看见一栋狭窄的建物，门上有石板装饰，窗户一片漆黑，散发著令人不安的气息。你之前有过这种奇怪的感觉，你伫立了一阵子后才回想起斯德哥尔摩的那栋建筑。如果不是看见漆黑的窗户跟独特的锐利线条，你可能无法回想起来。你检视著建筑，门上的石板吸引了你的注意力，你认出几个跟另一个建筑不同的符号，你看见奇怪、高瘦的人形，但样子非常不自然；嘴咧的太宽、眼睛也过于突出。门上的号码与斯德哥尔摩相同，都是13。你好奇地上前转动门把，但它纹丝不动。你试著敲门，却几乎没发出声音，虽然门的材质看起来像木头，摸起来却像水泥一般坚硬。你询问路人这座建筑是什么时候建成的。他们只是说：“这是个古老的地方，它已经在这里很多年了。”你疑惑著之前看到的那座建筑是否是原版的，又有多少城市中有类似的建筑？你看著建筑越久，不祥的感觉就越强，你打了个冷颤后离开了，决定不要跟它有更多牵扯。"

msgstr "检视过奇异建筑。"

msgid "As you navigate the labyrinthine art district, one façade in particular stands out to you. A narrow building with handsome cornice molding and intricate stonework is wedged between two older local buildings. The number 13 is carved next to a pair of austere wooden doors. Over the door is a slate frieze that depicts a cast of mythological figures: some recognizable, some not. The building itself looks out of place amidst the intricate architecture of the surrounding area. The look of the building makes you feel vaguely uneasy the longer you study it. There is a coldness, a sharpness to the building’s design, accentuated by jagged quoins and harsh angles. Something about the wide, black windows, the dark interior, denotes the emptiness of a hollow skull. The darkness in the evening only magnifies the sense of eeriness; others do not seem so willing to linger here."
msgstr "你穿越迷宫般的小路时，一栋狭窄的建物吸引了你的注意力。它的屋簷上有精美的装饰，还有精湛的石雕工艺，让它与两边老旧的建筑显得截然不同。简朴的木制大门上刻著数字13，门上方有一块石板，上面刻著各种神话中的符号与形状，有些你认识；有些无法辨认。这座建筑在周围建筑环绕下显得格格不入。不适的感觉在你检视建筑时逐渐增长，建筑本身的设计有种冷酷、尖锐的感觉，锐利的墙角跟线条更加强了这种印象。漆黑的大面窗户跟其中的黑暗就像骷髅的双眼一般空洞而诡异。夜晚昏暗的光线更增添了它不详的气息，街上的路人似乎都不想在此多逗留。"
