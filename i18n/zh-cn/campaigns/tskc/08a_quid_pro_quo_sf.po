"A set of obscure and overly-complex instructions leads you to a drab two-story stone building on the edge of San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood. Inside, a bored attendant slumps behind a desk near a brass elevator. Punching a specific code, the elevator takes you deep underground, farther than you could have predicted. On –14F, you step out and are greeted by an imposing man in a well-tailored suit and black fedora. “Archibald Hudson. We met in London,” he reminds you. “Your cell is quite the talk around the office.” The agent leads you down a seemingly endless hallway lined with alcoves. Each alcove displays something different: a model of a hollow earth, a crystal skull, a map with ley lines and other unknown markings. You pause and look at a half-eaten ear of corn, still steaming.\n"
"“From what I hear, that corn’s been cooked to perfection for the last two decades. So’s the dame who was eating it,” Agent Hudson says grimly. Looking at the paradimensional relics gives you a headache. Your eyes struggle to focus on them: they are both there and not there at the same time. Hudson ushers you down a side hall into a boxy room crammed with metal filing cabinets and sits down behind a heavy wooden desk. He speaks into a ring-and-spring microphone: “File #26–G2. Interview conducted by Hudson, Archibald, designation 42a6-951. That’s Agent Hudson to you,” he arches an eyebrow. Over the next several hours, you answer a gauntlet of grueling questions about your experience thus far, ranging from the past day to your experience in London. When it’s all done, Agent Hudson leans back and lights a cigarette. “I’ll admit, I was skeptical about you from the start. But Commissioner Taylor has good instincts, and I haven’t seen them steer her wrong yet,” he says. “You’ve done good work so far. We have some intel and some resources that might be useful for you. Tell me what the Foundation can do for you.”"

"杂乱无章的建筑群引领你到一栋座落在旧金山中国城边缘的单调双层石制建筑。一名接待员无聊地坐在里面的桌子后面，旁边是一台黄铜电梯。接待员依特殊的顺序按下几个键，似乎是密码，电梯开始下降到地下，比你意想之中的还要深。地下14楼，你踏出电梯，一名身穿合身西装，头戴软帽的魁武男人上前迎接你。“我是阿齐伯尔德·韩德森，我们在伦敦见过面。”他提醒你，“局里都在谈论你们呢。”这名探员领著你走过看似没有尽头、两侧有无数壁龛的走廊。每个壁龛里都展示著不同的东西：空心地球的模型、水晶骷髅、画满密道与未知记号的地图。在看到一根吃到一半的玉米时你不禁停下脚步，它居然还在冒烟。\n"
"“据我听到的说法，那根玉米在二十年前就煮好了，还顺便带走了吃它的老太太。”韩德森探员奸笑著说。看著这些超次元的物品让你感到头痛，你的眼睛很难聚焦，彷佛它们存在，同时又不存在一样。韩德森催促你走进旁边一个方形的小房间，里面塞满金属制的档案柜。他坐到厚重的木桌后，对著一组有线麦克风说：“申请调阅档案#26-G2，调阅者阿齐伯尔德·韩德森，座标42a6-951，韩德森探员。”然后他对你抬起一边眉毛。接下来的几个小时，你遭受各种细微的问题轰炸，从你最近的行动一路回溯到伦敦的事件，巨细靡遗。问完后，韩德森探员靠回椅背并点了一支烟。“我承认，我一开始并不看好你。但调查官泰勒的直觉一向很准，从没出错过。”他说到。“你目前为止都做得不错，我们有一些你用得上的情报跟资源，告诉我基石能帮你什么忙。”"

She pops back up every few decades, looking completely different each time. This iteration bears a striking resemblance to a former student of a ‘Miskatonic University’ in Massachusetts. Eryn Cochwyn was her name. She’s been missing for some time.” You wonder aloud if it might be a coincidence. “There are no coincidences in our line of work,” he mutters."
