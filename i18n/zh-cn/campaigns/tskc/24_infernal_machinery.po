"A heavy grey mist hangs in the air above Lake Victoria as your biplane touches down on a dusty runway. All leads in Nairobi about a Tuwile Masai point to the shoreline of Lake Victoria, where the Coterie member is said to have transported several tons of survey equipment. A faint but sharp scent of alkaline carries on the breeze as you walk to the lake, where several large boats are laden with heavy machinery at the shoreline. Sunlight catches on a pair of thick-rimmed spectacles down at the pier.\n"
"“Professor Masai?” you greet the wiry man as he steps ashore. Masai looks nervously past you as he wipes his glasses."

"你的飞机降落在尘土飞扬的跑道上，灰色的雾气笼罩著维多利亚湖。你在奈洛比查到所有关于图维勒·马赛的线索都指向维多利亚湖，他运送了许多研究器材到这里。你走在湖边时从风中闻到一股令人晕眩的强烈碱土气味，几艘装载沉重机械的船停在湖岸边，你看见码头上有副厚重的镜框反射著阳光。\n"
"“马赛教授？”你向站在湖边的结实男子打招呼，他在你靠近时紧张的擦拭著眼镜。"

"“Your reputation precedes you. As did the sound of your aeroplane,” Masai smiles, though you can sense a nervous undercurrent in his demeanor. “You have caught me at just the right time. Would you care to accompany me out to the water?”\n"
"You cordially accept, and the professor leads you to board the boat to take a seat at at the stern. A half dozen crew members board, and the engine thrums to life as you cut a path across the glassy surface of the lake. After setting course, the professor hunches in his seat across from you and studies you through heavy red-rimmed glasses. “In truth, I am surprised you sought me out. I am hardly the mover and shaker I once was in the Coterie. Now, their concerns seem trivial in comparison with all the great work that must be done.”\n"
"When you ask about his great work, the professor smiles. “It is the work of every person. What is it to be human except to live and help others in this great and perilous world? It’s harder than you might think.” He leafs through several papers, holding them tightly as the wind off Lake Victoria picks up. Masai shows you several complicated graphs and charts.\n"
"“The lakebed here is covered in the ruins of a sunken city built long ago. I happened upon it when monitoring acidity and chemical levels. Something was increasing—or perhaps better put: producing—an incredible amount of carbon dioxide. Along with several odd mutations in local fauna and flora. After several months of searching, we were able to trace the production to its source.” The professor pinpoints a red X on a large map of Lake Victoria. You ask if that is where the boat is headed now, and the professor chuckles. “No. It is already done. The source of the unusual production was an object of power. A Key. We drudged it up just last week.”\n"
"The hair on the back of your neck raises as the crew cuts power to the engine. None of them appear armed, but you are suddenly aware of your vulnerable position.\n"
"“Don’t fear for your life, my friend,” Masai rubs his glasses with a cloth. “I am not your enemy. Though I do worry for the Coterie itself. There is something strange at work among them. The one with the gloves in particular. He has been silent for too long, I think.” The professor sighs and leans back in his seat. Around you, the placid water of Lake Victoria ripples, dreamlike, as a heavy storm stirs the clouds overhead.\n"
"“It’s yours, of course,” Masai says, eyes closed, as he looks up at the sky. “The artifact we found was some infernal machine that was still running, even now, at the bottom of the lake. I wonder who started it, and when? And what will happen if it ever stops running? Either way, if your track record with my colleagues is to be believed, it is safer in your hands than in mine.” He opens his eyes and stares at the surface of the lake as the crew rev the engine.\n"
"“Perhaps you will succeed where I failed.”"

"“你的名声比你先到了，你的飞机声也是。”马赛笑著说，但你感觉到有种不安隐藏在他的外表下。“你来的正好，介意跟我一起到水里走一趟吗？”\n"
"你亲切的答应了，教授领著你登上一艘船并在船尾坐下。六名工作人员随你们登船，引擎作响，带你们划过如镜面一般的湖水。设定好航向后，教授坐回你对面的位子，透过红色的厚框眼镜打量你。“事实上，我很惊讶你会来找我。我在结社中的影响力已经大不如前了。现在他们只在乎那些无谓的竞赛，而忽略了远大的目标。”\n"
"你询问远大目标是什么，教授笑著回答：“这是属于每一个人的事业，如果人类在这个伟大但危险的世界不互相帮助的话，要怎么存活下来呢？但这比你想像的更困难。”他翻出几张文件，握紧它们以免被风吹走，他给你看了几张复杂的图片跟表格。\n"
"“这里的湖床中埋著一座沉没的远古遗迹。我在监测酸碱度与化学变化时发现有东西在增加，更准确的说——在制造大量的二氧化碳，附近区域也发现不明的动植物突变。经过几个月的调查后，我们找到了来源。”教授指著维多利亚湖地图上的一个红色记号，你问你们是否正是要前往这里搜寻。教授轻笑一声说：“不，我们已经找到了。这个来源就是一件具有力量的物件，一个密钥，我们上个礼拜确认了。”\n"
"当船员将引擎熄火时，你颈后的寒毛竖了起来。看起来没人带著武器，但你突然意识到自己不利的处境。\n"
"“别害怕，我的朋友。”教授边用布擦拭眼镜边说。“我不是你的敌人。但我确实担心结社中有某种不对劲的事正在发生。尤其是戴著手套的那位，我认为他沉寂太久了。”教授叹口气靠回座椅上。平静的维多利亚湖水围绕著你们，如梦似幻的泛著涟漪。一场风暴正在你们头顶的云层中酝酿。\n"
"马赛闭起眼睛望向天空：“当然，它是你的了。我们找到的这个东西是地狱般的机械，就连现在，它也持续在湖底运转著。我不知道是谁启动它的，又是何时启动的？而它停止运转后又会发生什么事？不管怎样，如果你真的像我的同志们说的一样值得信赖，那它在你手中会比在我手中更安全。”他睁开眼睛看著船员们打捞引擎。\n"
"“也许你能在我失败的地方取得成功。”"

"“I’m terribly sorry, but I don’t have time to chat,” Masai says as he steps lightly past you. You follow him, pressing for some assistance or insight, anything that can help in your struggle with the Red Coterie. “Ah. I had no idea I was dealing with the Foundation. You must be new.” Masai regards you in a new light, then leads you to sit in a makeshift camp. “Very well. Please wait here, and I’ll help you as soon as I can.”\n"
"You sit in a comedically short camping chair under the awning as the professor walks out of view. The minutes drift away as the clouds overhead break and a heavy rain begins to fall. After waiting for some time, you stand up and look out to the shoreline: the boats have gone. When you ask the locals for the professor’s whereabouts, they tell you he ended his survey and paid for passage across the lake.\n"
"After returning to Nairobi, you check with the British Consulate and discover that Masai’s travel expenses were being footed by his fellowship with Oxford. His declaration of travel includes an obscure address in Bermuda. Pocketing the information, you continue your travels."

"“我很抱歉，但我没时间闲聊。”他匆匆从你身边走过。你跟著他，对他施压，要求他给你一些关于绯红结社的情报。马赛用不同的眼神打量著你：“喔，我不知道你是基石的人，你一定是新来的。”他领著你到一顶帐篷中，并在其中坐下。“很好，请在这里稍等，我一有空就马上过来。”\n"
"你在帐篷雨棚下的矮凳坐下，看著教授的身影消失在视野中。过了几分钟后，天空下起了倾盆大雨。在等了一阵子后，你起身看向湖岸，船只都不见了。你询问当地人教授去哪了，他们说他的调查结束了，并坐船到湖对面去了。\n"
"你回到奈洛比后与英国领事馆联络，他们查到马赛的旅费登记在他牛津的协会之下，记录中有一个位于百慕达的模糊地点。你记下情报，准备继续旅程。"
