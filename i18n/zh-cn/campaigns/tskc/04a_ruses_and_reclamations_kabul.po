msgid "You search every known Coterie sanctum and safehouse in this region, looking high and low for the villain who stole your precious cargo, but find nothing. Either they’re not here, or they’re so well hidden that searching any more thoroughly would be a waste of time. Resigned, you plan your next move."
msgstr "你搜寻了每个已知的结社圣殿跟藏身处，四处寻找失窃的珍贵物件，但一无所获。如果不是东西不在这里，那就是他们藏的过于隐密，再深入搜寻会花费过多时间。你放弃搜索，计划下一步行动。"

msgstr "你终于找到猎物的藏身处。但在行动前，你潜伏起来并等待著适当的时机。既然拥有突袭的优势，你仔细的计划著行动细节……"

msgid "With a foe as enigmatic and potentially dangerous as The Red-Gloved Man, perhaps it is best to avoid confrontation altogether. You wait until you spot him leaving the sanctum and then start picking the lock of the same entrance… only, to your surprise, he has left it unlocked. You can almost imagine his blank stare from the shadows, mocking your every move. Does he know you’re here? Why steal from you only to hand the stolen objects back to you on a silver platter? In the end, you decide it is best to not look a gift horse in the mouth—after all, you’re not about to waste this opportunity. You grab the stolen relic and make your escape, wondering all the while the true motivations of the mysterious man."
msgstr "对付像红手套这种难以预测且有潜在危险的对手，最好的办法就是不要与他接触。你耐心等待，直到他离开圣殿。你上前想试著打开门锁，却惊讶的发现门没有上锁。你几乎可以想像他藏身在阴影中看著你，嘲笑你的一举一动。难道他知道你来了吗？但为什么要偷走你的东西后又双手奉还呢？最后你决定不要让到手的东西飞了，毕竟你不能浪费这次机会。你拿走失窃的物件后离开，思索著那个神秘男子的真实目的。"

msgid "You sneak into Amaranth’s sanctum and find what she stole piled in the corner of a cavernous foyer. A weak roar breaks the silence, and you see a tattered lion glowering at you from the dark. Your shock turns to disgust as you watch the poor creature struggle to stand: it is too decayed to even move. “You got what you came for. Now leave,” says a voice from the shadows. Squinting your eyes, you see Amaranth bent over the lion, her cheeks wet with tears. “Khalid, please,” she whispers. The lion lets out a weak growl, then flops onto its side to expose its rotten belly. “I told you to leave!” Amaranth screams. Your disgust turns to pity as you make your exit."
msgstr "你你潜入永生花的圣殿，发现失窃的物品堆在一个洞穴般的门廊前。突然一声虚弱的吼声打破寂静，你看见一头狮子从黑暗中怒视著你，你的惊讶转为恶心，那只狮子已经腐烂到几乎站不稳，也无法移动。阴影中传出一个声音：“你拿到你想要的了，滚吧。”你瞇起眼睛，看见永生花靠在狮子身侧，泪水滑落脸颊。“凯利德，拜托。”狮子发出一声虚弱的呻吟，侧身倒下露出腐烂的肚腹。“我叫你滚！”永生花对你尖叫。你离开时，心中的恶心感转为怜悯。"

msgid "Knowing the knight from Alexandria, you doubt he would dirty his hands personally—he must have sent enforcers to do his job for him. It’s likely he has set guards inside the safehouse, as well. Sneaking is probably out of the question, so you decide on a quick, direct approach: take the guards by surprise, grab what’s yours, and get out before they can respond with force. The job is clean and over in a matter of seconds. With the knight’s enforcers surely on your tail, you flee the city as fast as you can with your prize in tow."
msgstr "就你对亚历山卓那位骑士的认识，他绝对不会亲自动手，必定是让手下代劳。看来他在藏身处设置了守卫，偷溜进去是不可能了。所以你计划进行一次快速的直接侵入，出奇不意的打倒守卫，拿走你的东西，然后在他们动员前逃离。行动干净俐落的完成了，在骑士爪牙的追击下，你尽速带著战利品离开了城市。"

msgid "You and La Chica Roja have been playing this cat-and-mouse game for weeks. You’ve tracked her down enough times by now to know her modus operandi perhaps better than any other living person. It’s even starting to become a little fun, this tête-à-tête. You sneak into her sanctum and locate the relic in a hiding place not unlike where a remnant of the Weeping Lady was found during your last encounter. With a bit of a chuckle, you replace it with a little calling card of your own and escape without notice. As you leave the city later that night, a bystander slips a red envelope onto your person, bearing a message: “Nice one. Let’s play again some time.”"
msgstr "你跟红姑娘进行这个猫抓老鼠的游戏好几个礼拜了。你已经追踪到她数次，足以让你比世界上任何人都清楚她的行动模式，这场捉迷藏甚至变得有点有趣。你潜入她所在的圣殿，她这次将密钥藏在与上次你们争夺泣血女士碎片时截然不同的地方。你轻笑著将密钥换成自己的名片，然后神不知鬼不觉的离开。当晚你离开城市时，一名路人塞了个红色信封到你手中，里面写著：“有一套，下次我们再玩玩。”"

msgid "The Beast is no doubt the most violent and unpredictable foe you have encountered thus far. You count yourself lucky to have been out of your hotel room when it was sacked, or you would surely be dead. But from your mission in Alexandria, you know the creature has a weakness—it must hibernate from time to time. Quiet as a mouse, you slip into its sanctum unnoticed, the Beast’s rumbling breath emanating from a chamber deeper beneath your feet. Your heart races as you creep throughout the building, knowing any false step could spell your doom. The moment you grab the stolen artifact, the Beast begins to stir, and you rush to the exit. Even after putting miles between you and the creature’s lair, you can still hear its howls of anger and hate."
msgstr "野兽无疑是你面对的对手中最危险且无法预测的。你对于在牠闯入旅馆房间盗窃时自己并不在场感到幸运，不然你必定会没命。但就在亚历山卓的经验来看，你知道牠有个弱点——必须时不时地陷入沉眠。你像老鼠一样安静的潜入圣殿，野兽沉重的呼吸声从你脚下深处的密室传来。你的心跳在搜寻时快速跳动，心知踏错一步就会惹来杀身之祸。你拿到失窃物件的当下，野兽开始辗转反侧，你立即跑向出口。即使与野兽的巢穴已经相聚数哩，你还是能听见牠愤恨的咆啸。"

msgid "Faceless servants with scarlet collars and wings of darkness circle the watcher’s sanctum overhead. You move carefully under the cover of night, hoping to avoid detection. The man’s sanctum is more akin to a workshop, filled with torturous implements and strange, arcane tools. Among the many instruments is that which he stole from you, placed in the center of one of his workbenches as though he was studying it. The moment you grab it and move to escape, you hear his startled voice from another doorway. “Who is there?” Two empty eyesockets glare in your direction as you turn to face him. “Who is that?” He scrambles to find his ruby spectacles, but you are long gone before he is able to put them on."
msgstr "讪笑监视者的圣殿徘徊著鲜红衣领的无脸奴仆，黑暗的有翼怪物盘旋在圣殿上方。你小心翼翼的藉著夜色的掩护躲过监视。这座圣殿看起来更像是实验室，放著许多刑具与施法用品。失窃的密钥就放在其中一张工作台上，看起来他正在研究它。你拿起密钥的同时，走廊上传来一声警戒的声音：“是谁？”你转身看见一双空洞的眼眶看向你这边。“谁在那里？”他匆忙地想戴上红宝石眼镜，但你在他能看清前早已离开。"

msgid "To your surprise, the sanctum is completely empty. Not just empty, but abandoned entirely, perhaps for many years before you ever arrived. You wander through darkened halls and dusty, cobwebbed chambers, until finally you reach an old, decrepit bedroom. A full-length mirror adorns one wall, covered in dust and grime. Spotting a strange reflection in the glass, you wipe away the filth, revealing the haunting figure of Aliki behind you, her long, dark hair covering her eyes as she reaches for your neck. When you turn again, she is gone, but the feeling of something clenching around your neck remains. Spying your stolen Key on a nearby vanity, you snatch it and run, bursting through the door of the sanctum with a resounding thud. You don’t stop running until you have left the city behind."
msgstr "你很惊讶整座圣殿都空荡荡的。不只是空的，看来在你到来前就废弃已久了。你走在黑暗的大厅跟尘封结网的房间之间，最后你找到一间老旧的卧室。一面全身镜挂在墙上，覆满灰尘。你看见镜中有奇怪的倒影，于是你拂去尘土，看见阿利琪飘渺的身影就站在你身后，乌黑的长发在她将手伸向你的脖子时掩盖了她的脸庞。你转身看时她就消失了，但你的脖子上依然残留著压迫感。你瞄见失窃的密钥就放在旁边的梳妆台上，你抓起它开始奔跑，在一声巨响回荡中你冲出了圣殿大门，在离开城市前都没有停下脚步。"

msgid "If there’s one thing you know about Thorne, it’s that they won’t pass on an opportunity to make a deal. Rather than sneak in, you knock on the front door of their sanctum and are admitted by several smooth, attractive attendants. Thorne sits at the head of a long table, hands steepled. “What a delight! I had no idea you were coming,” they smile brightly, then gesture for you to sit. Drinks and a lavish meal are served, and eventually you steer the conversation toward returning what they stole. “Ah yes. ‘Keys.’ It’s always about ‘Keys,’ isn’t it?” They pour another glass of wine. “Things have changed. I suppose I could be amenable to such an exchange. But only if you make it worth my while.” It takes nearly an hour to come up with compensation enough for Thorne to change their mind, but eventually you leave their sanctum with your stolen relic… and a bit poorer, besides."
msgstr "如果你对索恩有任何认识，那就是他不会放过任何做交易的机会。所以你没有偷溜进去，反而敲响了圣殿的大门，几名有礼迷人的侍者引你入内。索恩坐在一张长桌的主位，张开双臂说道：“真是个惊喜，我不知道你要来。”他愉悦的笑著，示意你入座。精致的餐点与饮品被送上桌，最后你终于提起归还失窃密钥的话题。“啊，是的，‘密钥’，什么都跟‘密钥’有关，对吧？”他边帮自己倒了另一杯酒边说：“情况有变，我想我能接受这个提议，但你要让我觉得物有所值。”你们讨论了将近一小时才达成让索恩满意的共识。你最后带著失窃的密钥离开，但也变得更穷了……。"

msgid "You sneak into Desi’s safehouse and are stunned to find that it is no vault or Coterie hideout, but a fully stocked bar with patrons in boisterous revelry. A bouncer in a pinstripe suit stops you as you enter, but before you can protest or fight back, you hear Desi’s voice call out: “Hey. It’s fine. Let ‘em in.” The bouncer relents, and you sit at a booth across from your adversary. “Guessing I know what this is about. Tell you what: I’m in a good mood. Have a drink or two and I’ll play you for it,” he says, shuffling a deck of cards. Seeing your expression, he grins. “Oh, lighten up. I’m not like those others. One hand. Then we call it even and go our separate ways.” Considering the circumstances, you decide it best to play along—literally. As luck would have it, three jacks is more than enough to beat Desi’s pair. You end up leaving shortly after with your Key reclaimed and no worse for the wear, wondering how much of a sore loser Desi and his crew might be."
msgstr "你潜入德西的藏身处时惊讶地发现这里不是金库也不是结社据点。而是一个充满酒客与狂欢舞者的热闹酒吧。一名身穿条纹西装的保镳挡住你的去路，在你开口或动手前，德西的声音传来：“嘿，没关系。让他们进来。”保镳让路，你走进包厢，坐在你的对手对面。“我猜我知道你为何而来。这样吧，我现在心情不错，你来喝几杯，我们来赌一把。”他边说边洗著一副扑克牌。看到你的表情时他笑了：“别这样，开心一点。我跟其他那些人不一样，来一局，然后我们就扯平了，各走各的。”考虑到你的处境，你决定最好还是跟他玩一场。幸运女神眷顾你，三张杰克赢了德西的一对。你很快带著密钥毫发无伤的离开，希望德西跟他的手下没有那么输不起。"

msgid "Given how dangerous Tzu San Niang was while in possession of a Key, you decide a direct confrontation is out of the question. Stealth is by far the better option. You sneak into a large industrial complex after dark and locate what she stole behind a locked door. As you pick the locks, you hear a lilting voice echo off of the narrow corridors. A haunting song in Shanghainese fills the empty factory. Working quickly, you reclaim the stolen artifact and retrace your steps to the exit, looking over your shoulder at every turn. The song lingers in your memory long after you make your escape."
msgstr "你很清楚梓三娘持有密钥时有多危险，所以排除直接接触的选项，潜入会是比较好的选择。天黑后你潜入一间工厂，锁定她藏著密钥的房间。正当你试著开锁时，哼歌声从狭窄的走廊传来，一首上海曲调萦绕在空荡的厂房中。你加快动作，拿走密钥后原路走向出口，每个转弯处都不禁回头查看。即使在逃离后许久，那首曲调仍在你脑海中阴魂不散。"

msgid "Update the Keys section of your Campaign Log such that the Key(s) that were stolen return to their original bearers."
msgstr "更新剧本日志中密钥的部分，使遭窃的密钥回到其原先的承受者。"

msgid "Each investigator earns 1 experience, plus 1 additional experience for each tally mark recorded next to wrong leads."
msgstr "每位调查员获得1点经验值，错误线索旁每有一个标记，再额外获得1点经验值。"

msgid "Cross off “14–C” on each of the remaining locations in the Campaign Log."
msgstr "划掉剧本日志中每个剩余地点上的“14-C”。"
