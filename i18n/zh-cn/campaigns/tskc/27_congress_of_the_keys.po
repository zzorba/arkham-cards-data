"You awaken in darkness. A sack is removed from your head and cast aside, and your cheek is squeezed and struck once or twice for good measure. “Wake up,” a sinister voice commands. You blink unconsciousness away and realize, with some panic, that you and your partners are bound to chairs. A gag prevents you from making any noise louder than a muffled cry.\n"
"As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you realize you must be underground. The large, windowless chamber is made of clean, worked stone, lit faintly by mercury vapor lamps. Scarlet tapestries line the walls, along with several glass cases and shelves containing old relics and historical artifacts. Dominating the room is an enormous central table, an elaborate pattern of lines and rings carved meticulously along its surface. Standing around this central table are a host of figures, some familiar to you, others unrecognizable. All of them bear red. Your heart surges in your throat. “You have been brought here to account for your crimes against the Coterie,” the voice states, “or to be commended, if that is the will of the Congress. We will now entertain any who wish to speak on your behalf, or against you.”"

"你在一片黑暗中醒来，突然你头上的布袋被抽开扔在一旁，有人掐著你的脸颊并拍了一两下确认你已经清醒。“起来。”一个恶毒的声音下令。你眨著眼想清醒过来，然后惊慌地发现你跟你的伙伴们被绑在椅子上，嘴里塞著口衔，让你们只能发出模糊的哼声。\n"
"你的眼睛适应昏暗的光线后，你发现自己一定身处地底下。这座没有窗户的大厅由俐落、做工良好的石材砌成，水银灯发出的微光照亮墙面，墙上有绯红色的装饰，墙边有几个玻璃展示柜，里面放著各种文物或具有历史性的工艺品。而最显眼的是房间中央的巨大桌子，桌面上有精雕细琢的各种图案与线条。一群身影站在大桌旁，有些很眼熟；其他的都不认识，但他们全都穿戴著绯红色。你感到非常不安。“你们将为了对结社做过的事付出代价；抑或是接受表扬，一切皆由峰会决定。”先前的声音宣告著。“现在，我们将允许所有人发言，无论是指控；或是辩护。”"

"You would never have found the secret hideout of the Red Coterie without the intel Commissioner Taylor sent you. The compound lies deep underground in the heart of Siberia, not far from the mysterious crater that marks the site of the notorious Tunguska event—a blast, or perhaps impact, the true nature of which has been shrouded in mystery for over a decade. Maybe there is a connection between this strange event and the Coterie’s presence—no, knowing the kind of dangerous artifacts the Coterie possesses, there is no doubt in your mind. The question is: which came first?\n"
"The compound’s entrance is masked by heavy snow and remote wilderness, but eventually, you find it—an unmarked steel door embedded in the side of a snowy hilltop, almost impossible to see from afar. You are surprised to find the door unlocked… but the moment you enter, you are set upon by Coterie guards with suspicious eyes and familiar red clothing. “We’ve been expecting you,” one of them says with a wicked grin. “Come. The Congress is about to begin.”\n"
"You have little choice but to follow. The guards lead you deeper and deeper into the complex, down steep, narrow stairways of worked stone and through dark, drab corridors, until finally you reach a large, windowless chamber lit faintly by mercury vapor lamps. Scarlet tapestries line the walls, along with several glass cases and shelves containing old relics and historical artifacts. Dominating the room is an enormous central table, an elaborate pattern of lines and rings carved meticulously along its surface. Standing around this central table are a host of figures, some familiar to you, others unrecognizable. All of them bear red. The door leading into the chamber slams shut behind you, and your heart surges in your throat. “Your timing is impeccable,” a voice among the gathered Coterie states. “We were just about to begin the vote.”\n"
"You inquire as to the nature of this vote, your mouth suddenly dry. You cannot shake the feeling that you have come here merely to look your own doom in the eyes. “A meeting has been called. To account for your crimes against the Coterie, or to be commended, if that is the will of the Congress. We will now entertain any who wish to speak on your behalf, or against you.” From behind, you are suddenly restrained and a gag is placed over your mouth. “Just a formality, I promise you,” the guard drawls with a grin."

"如果没有调查官泰勒提供的情报，你一定找不到绯红结社的秘密据点。它藏身在西伯利亚中心的地底，距离通古斯的神秘大坑不远，这场十几年前发生的大爆炸或是撞击，其真实原因依然成谜。也许这个事件与结社有某种关联——不，有鉴于他们掌握的危险物品，必定与他们有关。问题是前因后果是什么？\n"
"据点入口隐藏在大雪与荒芜的原野中，但你终于还是找到了。扇铁门隐藏在覆满白雪的山丘侧面，不走近几乎无法辨认。你很惊讶地发现门没有上锁，但你进入时，马上撞见身穿熟悉红色服饰的结社守卫，他们用怀疑的眼神看著你。其中一名守卫带著邪魅的笑容开口说道：“我们正等著你的到来。来吧，峰会要开始了。”\n"
"你没什么选择，只好跟著他们。守卫领著你深入地下，走过狭窄的楼梯与单调的石砌廊道。终于你们抵达一间没有窗户的大厅，水银灯发出的微光照亮墙面，墙上有绯红色的装饰，墙边有几个玻璃展示柜，里面放著各种文物或具有历史性的工艺品。而最显眼的是房间中央的巨大桌子，桌面上有精雕细琢的各种图案与线条。一群身影站在大桌旁，有些很眼熟；其他的都不认识，但他们全都穿戴著绯红色。大门在你身后轰然关上，你瞬间感到非常不安。从人群中传出一个声音宣告道：“你的时机正好，我们正要开始进行投票。”\n"
"你出声询问投票的目的时，嘴唇突然变得干燥，你无法摆脱自己是主动前来面对毁灭的感觉。“一场集会被召开了。你将为了对结社做过的事付出代价；抑或是接受表扬，一切皆由峰会决定。现在，我们将允许所有人发言，无论是指控；或是辩护。”突然你被从后方束缚住并塞上口衔。守卫笑著说道：“这只是出于正式的程序，我保证。”"

A cold blade is placed at the edge of your neck. “You who seek to harm our noble cause have been accused and charged with numerous crimes against the Coterie,” a voice states with dreadful gravity. The blade bites against your skin. A trail of blood trickles down your neck. “The punishment is death. May the crimson stain of your legacy be washed away.” You close your eyes and brace yourself.\n"

You struggle again to free yourself, but are unable… until moments later, when you are dragged out of the chamber. Your bonds are cut, and you are brought to your feet by none other than the woman in the vermillion veil herself. Ece ushers you down the hall, whispering over the chaos of the battle. “We have to get out of here.” Several of the others who wear red follow in your wake, looking over their shoulders the entire time.\n"
"You ask what is going on as another rumble shudders throughout the halls. “The one with the red gloves, he…” she trails off, her hand trembling as she grips your arm. “He’s not what we thought he was. That man always creeped me out, but—to think—how could we have not known—?”\n"
"You ask her to start again, slower. “He attacked us,” she says, meeting your gaze as you duck into a quiet hall filled with scarlet tapestries. “The others fought him off, but… there was something strange about him. He was not human. It was something else entirely. It stole as many implements as it could and escaped, like…” she shudders. “…just like one of the creatures we seek to destroy.”\n"

For too long, they have used their collected power not to guard humanity, but to plague it. As you speak, several of the people you have met nod amongst themselves. “They’re right,” the girl in the red coat announces, gesturing at several of the others who look on with sneers. “You all say you are motivated by a duty to humanity, yet you tolerate the presence of those who only do others harm.

"你恐惧地看著更多的身影开始扭曲变形，残暴地屠杀周围所有人。一瞬间，金属撞击声跟枪声同时作响在大厅之中。每位被杀害的结社成员都被抹除了存在，当抓捕你的人也被从现实中抹去时，你完全不知所措。你在激烈的战斗中匍匐在地，最后终于找到一片锐利的玻璃将束缚割开。当你将同伴解救出来时，那些存在已经逃离了。你最后看见的是红手套已经不成人形的身影从你进来的大门逃离。\n"
"你确认著周遭的伤亡，但出乎意料的没有多少痕迹。只有几套被抛弃的红色衣物散落在地上，整个大厅空荡荡的。\n"
"你恐惧地发现你完全没有关于那些结社成员跟仿冒者的记忆，一个都没有。"

"With the trial proceedings over, the Congress finally reaches other affairs. “There is still the matter of the Outsiders,” one among them states. “We have assembled our strength in order to prepare for the inevitable, but how can we be certain our dimension is of any interest to them? We cannot seek to understand such abstruse entities.”\n"
"You chime in, telling the Congress of everything you have seen during your travels and your operations with the Foundation: the strange happenings across the globe have only grown in frequency, and you have reason to believe they are intelligent and malicious—not mindless and incomprehensible. What’s worse, they appear to be after the very same keys as everyone else.\n"
"“If they are stirring, preparing for war,” another member declares, “then we must do the same. We have among our assembly bearers of the most powerful artifacts this order has uncovered. Let us put them to good use and exterminate this threat once and for all.” Nods and murmurs of consent ripple throughout the assembly.\n"
"“But if they are intelligent entities as our new friends claim they are, how could they possibly know so much of our inner workings?” Your detractor argues. A dreadful hunch stirs in your mind. You scan the room and remark that one among the Congress is missing. The rest of the assembly follows your gaze, with several of them standing to search the chamber more thoroughly. One of them confirms your suspicions by raising a single red glove, discarded and forgotten as though mundane, immaterial.\n"
"The woman in the vermillion veil is the first to understand your thread of logic. “Spread out,” she shouts, her voice warbling. “Find him. Learn where he is headed. And be ready for anything.”\n"
"It doesn’t take long before the doorway is found—a shimmering portal of extradimensional energy, ebbing with eldritch power. “It’s closing,” one of the others observes. Indeed, the doorway seems to be shrinking as it steadily swirls, and soon enough there will be nothing left of it. “We don’t have much time.”"

"审判终于告一段落，终于可以将峰会的注意力转向其他事务。其中一位成员发言：“异域存在依然是个威胁。我们不断积蓄力量准备面对无法避免的危机，但我们如何确定牠们是否真的对我们的次元有兴趣呢？我们无法理解那些诡秘的存在。”\n"
"你插话，说出所有你在旅程中与基石的行动中看到的所有关于那些存在的情报。发生在世界各地的奇异事件越来越频繁，而且你有理由认为这些生物是有智慧且满怀恶意的，而非无计画的依循本能行动。更糟的是，你认为牠们也同样在追寻密钥。\n"
"另一名成员说道：“如果他们在蠢蠢欲动，准备发动战争，那我们也必须做好准备。我们应该召集我们之中最强的人，带上我们力量最强大的密钥。我们应该利用密钥的力量清除这个威胁，永绝后患。”群众中泛起一阵同意的低语。\n"
"“但如果牠们像这位新朋友说的这么聪明，牠们又是怎么对我们内部运作了如指掌呢？”一名成员提出怀疑。你带著一股不祥的预感扫视大厅，发现其中一名成员不见了。其他人注意到你的视线，起身更仔细的搜寻整座大厅。其中一个人证明了你的恐惧，一只红色手套被丢弃在角落，彷佛它对所有者毫无意义。\n"
"带著红头巾的那位女士首先理解了你的猜想。她用颤抖的声音下令：“分头散开，找到他，找出他去哪了。小心，准备面对任何情况。”\n"
"没过多久你们就找到了他的去向：一道发著光的传送门，散发著超次元的能量，怪异的力量在其中翻涌。其中一名成员上前观察后说道：“它正在关闭。”它的确正在逐渐缩小，再过一阵子就会消失无踪。“我们没时间了。”"
