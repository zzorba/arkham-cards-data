msgid "The brilliant sandy beaches and azure water dazzle your senses as you arrive in Bermuda proper. Rows of brightly painted homes add to the eye-popping landscape as you travel from one corner of Bermuda island to the other, asking locals for any possible leads on Coterie activity."
msgstr "你踏上百慕达的土地时，闪闪发亮的沙滩和蔚蓝的海水让你目不转睛，走过岛上时看见许多鲜艳的民居跟壮观的天然景观。你四处询问当地人关于结社的行踪。"

msgid "After mentioning Tuwile Masai by name, you are directed to a residence just past the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse on the southern end of the island. The directions lead you to a lavish bungalow with a well-kept garden overlooking the ocean. Keeping your guard up, you walk to the screen door of the house and knock. A familiar figure wearing loose slacks and a maroon linen shirt opens the door."
msgstr "提到图维勒·马赛的名字后，你被指引到岛的南边，吉布斯山灯塔附近的一座豪华平房，屋子前有一片精心照料的花园眺望著大海。你提高警觉，敲了敲前门，一个身穿宽松长裤跟红褐色亚麻上衣的熟悉身影来到门前。"

"“If you have come to dispose of me, please make it quick,” Masai says coldly. He stands on the other side of the screen door, sweat beading on his dark skin, as he locks eyes with you. You try to explain yourself as best you can, but you can see from Masai’s body language and tone that he is set against you. After a chilly exchange, he steps onto the porch.\n"
"“Say what you will, but it is clear to me that you are interested in only one thing: power. If Commissioner Taylor had half her wits about her, she should treat you with the same fear as she treats me and my colleagues. None of you understand. None of you understand the great work we must do, as brethren, in order to live freely. One can only control the power of a Key so long before they themselves are controlled.”\n"
"Masai scoffs and takes off his large red spectacles. “You are no better than the worst of us.” He follows your gaze and holds up the spectacles. “These are of no significance. I learned too late of the dangers of holding such power myself. Now leave me in peace.”"

"“如果你是来解决我的，请你动作俐落一点。”他冷冷的说。马赛站在门的另一边，汗水从他黝黑的皮肤滴落，视线紧盯著你。你试著解释，但他的肢体语言跟语气一再透露出他对抗你的决心。经过一段冰冷的沟通，他终于愿意走到门廊上。\n"
"“随便你怎么说，但我看得很清楚，你只想要一样东西：力量。如果调查官泰勒有传闻中的一半聪明，她就应该像敌视我跟我的同志一样敌视你。你们都不了解，你们没有一个人了解我们远大的目标，每个人都能像手足兄弟一般自由的生活。那些控制密钥的人，最后都无法免于反过来被它控制。”\n"
"马赛轻蔑地拿下红色的厚框眼镜说：“你跟我们之中最糟糕的成员没什么两样。”他感觉到你看著眼镜的视线，他拿起眼镜说：“这个没有任何力量，我只后悔自己没早点发现掌握力量会有多危险。现在，请你离开。”"

"“You are either very persistent or very foolish,” Masai smiles. He steps out onto the porch and looks you up and down, as if sizing you up, then nods for you to follow as he walks out to the white-sanded beach. The waves lap hungrily at the shoreline as you walk alongside him.\n"
"“I apologize for my rudeness earlier. I couldn’t be certain of your intentions. And there have been a few… incidents lately,” Masai says gravely. A thick log of smooth driftwood lies buried in the sand in front of you, covered in a swarm of bright red-and-blue crabs. You ask about the incidents.\n"
"“A number of unannounced visits. The Foundation, obviously. Several days before your arrival at Lake Victoria, another member of my organization appeared at our camp, very interested in the key we had recovered. The one with the red gloves.” The professor stops, looking out at the rolling tide. “It bears explanation, I suppose. My survey of Lake Victoria turned up a number of alarming reports. The lakebed is covered in the ruins of a prehistoric city. We registered an alarming amount of carbon dioxide and strange changes in the local flora and fauna around the lake. At its source, we found a machine of alien design. Its purpose and facility are still a mystery, but whatever it was: it was running. Still is.”\n"
"Masai wipes his red spectacles with a handkerchief. “All that to say: several days before you arrived, I found that man sitting in front of the machine, hat off, staring at it. He was humming—well, that’s not quite right—he was communing with it.”\n"
"A shaft of cloud splits the sunlight overhead, casting the beach in dappled shadows. Masai’s voice breaks the silence. “In truth, I did not care to understand why. Why that man does anything has always been a mystery to me. But there was something other about his demeanor. Something altogether wrong.” Masai breathes deeply as the cloud passes, and warm sunlight overtakes the beach. “So imagine my suspicion when even more as yet unknown Foundation operatives showed up at my survey to interrupt my great work.”\n"
"You ask Masai about this “great work.” He leads you to turn around and begin walking back to his bungalow.\n"
"“It is the work of every person. What is it to be human except to live and help others in this great and perilous world? It’s harder than you might think.” He breathes deep. “If I can leave the world a bit better than I entered it, my work will be done. That is all. It is why the acquisition and squabbling over these Keys is such misdirection. One can only control a Key’s power so long before they become controlled.”\n"
"“But I sense a similar purpose in you,” Masai says. “I will not tell my colleagues we had this conversation, or what I have done with that infernal machine. The Key is yours, until you decide that it should not be. Keep it away from the man with the red gloves at any cost.”"

"“你要不是意志很坚定，要不就是笨蛋。”马赛微笑著说。他走出门廊，上下打量著你，然后点头示意你跟著他。你们散步的同时，一阵阵海浪拍打在白色沙滩的上。\n"
"“我为我先前粗鲁的行为道歉，我不确定你的意图。而近期又发生了一些……意料之外的事。”马赛沉重地说。一大块漂流木半掩埋在沙滩上，一群红蓝相间的螃蟹在上面爬来爬去。你询问他发生了什么事。\n"
"“许多意料之外的访客，不用说，都是基石的人。而在你到达维多利亚湖的前几天，一名结社的成员，也出现在我们的营地前，对我们发现的密钥非常有兴趣。就是戴著红手套的那位。”教授暂停了一下，看著翻卷的海浪。“我认为这值得探究。我对维多利亚湖的调查有许多怪异的报告。那座湖底埋著远古的遗迹。我们观测到不明的大量二氧化碳跟周遭动植物不正常的变化。在这一切的源头，我们找到了一个看起来像外星设计的机器。它的目的跟功能依然是个谜，但不管它是什么，它持续在运作，就连现在也是。”\n"
"马赛用手帕擦了擦他的红色眼镜。“在你抵达的几天前，我发现那个人坐在机械前，脱下帽子盯著它。他在喃喃自语——这样讲不精确，他是在跟它沟通。”\n"
"一朵云突然遮断了阳光，在沙滩下投下阴影。马赛在片刻的寂静后说：“事实上，我不在乎他为什么这样做，那个人做的所有事对我来说都很神秘。但他的行为透露出其他东西，一种完全不对劲的感觉。”乌云飘过，沙滩重新沐浴在温暖的阳光下，马赛深吸了一口气说：“而过没多久，一个不知名的基石探员就出现打断我的调查与远大目标时，你可以想像我有多防备。”\n"
"你询问马萨关于这个所谓的“远大目标”是什么。他转身领著你走回他的平房。\n"
"“这是属于每一个人的事业，如果人类在这个伟大但危险的世界不互相帮助的话，要怎么存活下来呢？但这比你想像的更困难。”他深吸一口气：“如果我在离开这个世界时，能让它变得比我来时更好一些，那我的工作就完成了，就只是这样。那些所有跟密钥有关的争夺与争论都只是误导罢了，那些控制密钥的人，最后都无法免于反过来被它控制。”\n"
"“我在你的身上感觉到了跟我一样的目标。”马赛说。“我不会跟我的同志们提起这段对话，或是我怎么处理那个地狱机械。密钥是你的了，直到你选择放弃它。请不计代价保护它，别让它落入红手套手中。”"

"You are almost relieved that your questioning goes nowhere; the lack of Coterie activity in Bermuda gives you an unlikely chance to rest and recuperate. For just a moment, you need only to concern yourself with the peaceful stillness of the island.\n"
"With several days remaining until your next departure, you follow the recommendation of the concierge at your hotel and take the time to explore the Crystal Caves up near the northern end of the island. Your guide is missing an arm; they illuminate dancing patterns in the darkness with their flashlight as they tell you the story of how the caves were found. You ask them how they lost their arm. “I served in the Great War,” they tell you. “Sometimes peace comes at great cost.”"

"你几乎对于毫无收获的结果感到松了一口气。百慕达似乎没有结社活动的痕迹，这给了你意料之外的休息时间。你终于可以喘口气，只需要担心如何享受岛上的宁静气氛。\n"
"既然离你的出发时间还有几天，你决定听从旅馆侍者的建议，到小岛北边的水晶洞窟探险。你的向导是一位独臂男子，他在黑暗中用手电筒的光线织出一个个舞动的图案，同时述说祖先如何发现这个洞穴的传说故事。你询问他如何失去手臂的。“我参与过世界大战。”他回答。“有时候和平要付出巨大的代价。”"
