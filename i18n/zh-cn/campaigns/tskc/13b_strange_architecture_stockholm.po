msgstr "斯德哥尔摩"

msgid "The docks bustle with activity as you arrive in Stockholm. Towering dock workers load massive crates of silvery, flapping fish into trucks as morning chimes ring in the cool clear air. With several days until your next departure, you seize upon the opportunity to explore the city’s eclectic culture. Advertisements for a production of a play named “Ödestimmen” paper the alleys and stops surrounding Stockholm’s largest theatre. You follow the cobblestone streets around Stockholm’s old town district, which the locals tell you is called “the town between bridges.” The winding narrow paths loop in on themselves and cross at odd angles to form a labyrinth of crumbled mustard-yellow alleys and worn façades. You pass a row of distinctly painted rowhouses overlooking the town square. As you sit down and watch locals come and go, you feel a great weight lift from you, if only for a moment. The broad blue sky overhead is clear and cloudless, and the hubbub around you is strangely calming."
msgstr "你在斯德哥尔摩繁忙的港口下船。在冰冷清澈的晨间空气中，高大的码头工人正将一箱箱装满鲜活跳动的银色渔获装载到货车上。离你下一次启程还有几天，你决定把握时间体验这座城市独特的文化。在城内最大戏院的街上到处都贴满一出名叫“命运之声”戏剧的广告。你沿著鹅卵石街道步行到斯德哥尔摩的旧城区，当地人称呼那里为“桥梁间的小镇”。起风的窄巷以奇怪的角度互相纠缠，形成一个由老旧店面跟斑驳黄色墙壁形成的迷宫。你走过一排五颜六色的房屋，向下俯视著小镇的广场。你坐在路边，看著当地人来来去去，在这个瞬间，你感觉肩上的重担稍微减轻了一些。头顶湛蓝广阔的天空晴朗无云，熙熙攘攘的人声让你感到意外的平静。"

msgid "As you walk down Shoemaker’s street, you pass a familiar sight. Looking up, you see a narrow building with a slate façade, wide black windows, and unsettling accents. You have the distinct feeling you have been here before. You stand still for a moment as others pass you in the narrow alley, until you remember the same building in Bombay. If not for the distinct, black windows and the harsh lines, you might not have remembered it. As you scan the façade, the frieze overhanging the door stands out to you. Where there were various recognizable figures before, you see odd, gangling facsimiles. The features are almost plastic; the smiles are too broad; the eyes seem to bulge. The number 13 is carved next to the door, same as in Bombay. Curious, you step up and turn the doorknob, but it doesn’t budge. Knocking on the door produces virtually no sound. Although it looks like wood, it feels solid as concrete. Stopping a passer-by, you ask how long the building has been here. “What do you mean? This is a very old city. It’s always been here,” they tell you. You find yourself questioning if the original you saw was even the original: how many other houses look just like this one in how many other cities? The building grows more foreboding the longer you look at it. A shudder courses up your spine, and you decide to leave the building alone."
msgstr "你走在鞋匠街上时，看见一个熟悉的景象，你抬头看见一栋狭窄的建物，门上有石板装饰，窗户一片漆黑，散发著令人不安的气息。你之前有过这种奇怪的感觉，你伫立了一阵子后才回想起孟买的那栋建筑。如果不是看见漆黑的窗户跟独特的锐利线条，你可能无法回想起来。你检视著建筑，门上的石板吸引了你的注意力，你认出几个跟另一个建筑不同的符号，你看见奇怪、高瘦的人形，但样子非常不自然，嘴咧的太宽、眼睛也过于突出。门上的号码与孟买相同，都是13。你好奇的上前转动门把，但它纹丝不动。你试著敲门，却几乎没发出声音，虽然门的材质看起来像木头，摸起来却像水泥一般坚硬。你询问路人这座建筑是什么时候建成的。他们说：“什么意思？这是座古老的城市，它一直都在阿。”你疑惑著之前看到的那座建筑是否是原版的，又有多少城市中有类似的建筑？你看著建筑越久，不祥的感觉就越强，你打了个冷颤后离开了，决定不要跟它有更多牵扯。"

msgid "As you walk down Shoemaker’s street, one façade in particular stands out to you. A narrow building with handsome cornice molding and intricate stonework is wedged between two older local buildings. The number 13 is carved next to a pair of austere wooden doors. Over the door is a slate frieze that depicts a cast of mythological figures: some recognizable, some not. The building itself looks out of place amidst the worn stone and crumbling history of the surrounding alleyway. The look of the building makes you feel vaguely uneasy the longer you study it. There is a coldness, a sharpness to the building’s design, accentuated by jagged quoins and harsh angles. Something about the wide, black windows, the dark interior, denotes the emptiness of a hollow skull. The alley around you, too, is strangely quiet: passers-by do not seem to linger here."
msgstr "你走在斯德哥尔摩的街道上时，一栋狭窄的建物吸引了你的注意力。它的屋簷上有精美的装饰，还有精湛的石雕工艺，让它与两边老旧的建筑显得截然不同。简朴的木制大门上刻著数字13，门上方有一块石板，上面刻著各种神话中的符号与形状，有些你认识；有些无法辨认。这座建筑与巷道中老旧破损的历史建筑相比显得格格不入。不适的感觉在你检视建筑时逐渐增长，建筑本身的设计有种冷酷、尖锐的感觉，锐利的墙角跟线条更加强了这种印象。漆黑的大面窗户跟其中的黑暗就像骷髅的双眼一般空洞而诡异。四周的巷道安静的很不自然，看来行人们都不愿在此逗留。"
