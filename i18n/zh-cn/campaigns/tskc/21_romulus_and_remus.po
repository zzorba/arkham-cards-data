"“This is… possibly one of the worst ideas I’ve ever had,” Agent Quinn remarks as the two of you approach the Palatine Hill. The ruins of numerous temples litter the area, once marvels of luminous white marble, decorated with intricate reliefs of ivory and delicately carved statues; now nothing more than broken vestiges and stone foundations half-buried along the hill. You try your best to reassure Quinn, but she is right—this could easily be a wild goose chase or a trap. Commissioner Taylor would certainly not be happy if she knew her agents were attempting to parley with a member of the Red Coterie. But you suspect that Aliki knows more about the strange disappearances happening all over the globe than you do, and perhaps that is more important than the mission Taylor gave you. Quinn sighs and nods in agreement. “I know. That’s why I’m here. But still…” She stops in her tracks, spotting something in the distance, and begins walking in that direction. “There—those are the ruins of the palace of Caesar Augustus, who was thought to have built the Temple of Apollo Palatinus nearby. Most scholars believe these nearby ruins to belong to the Temple of Jupiter Victor, but I wager they are in fact Apollo’s.”\n"
"You sigh and pull out the white raven whistle Aliki gave you. Now is as good a time as any to give it a shot. Worst case scenario, you’ve simply wasted your time, and Quinn’s. You put the whistle to your lips and blow. Emerging is a paradoxically distant sound, a warbling trill not unlike the shrill sound that has haunted you ever since Kathmandu. The wind picks up, sudden and chill. Quinn pulls her coat over her torso with a shudder. Then, arriving just as swiftly as the bitter wind, you spy her.\n"
"Aliki Zoni Uperetria stands just over the ancient temple ruins, her red sash a splash of flowing color in the harsh breeze. As the wind and the discordant whistle both fade, her hair settles over her face, obscuring her expression. “I hope you know what you’re doing,” Quinn murmurs to you under her breath as she approaches the haunting figure with much trepidation. The girl in the scarlet sash speaks a single word in ancient Egyptian, stopping Quinn in her tracks. The agent replies in kind, causing Aliki’s head to tilt to the side in curious understanding. Slowly, bit by bit, the two begin to converse, changing languages every other sentence like two students testing one another. You watch in awe as the two juggle ancient languages as easily as breathing.\n"
"Finally, Quinn addresses you. “You were right. She’s searching for a place where…” Aliki speaks again, and Quinn translates. “The entities you’ve encountered. She thinks the things they take—no, devour—she thinks they end up somewhere else. She’s searching for the place where they go.” You ask Quinn if she can think of any place on Earth that might be a hotspot for such activity. “There is one that I can think of,” she replies. “The Bermuda Triangle, otherwise known as The Devil’s Triangle, in the Atlantic. We’ve tried our best to keep it under wraps, but a lot of ships and even some aircraft have gone missing in that area. A few of those incidents are on my list of memory anomalies, as well. Could be some kind of… gateway.”\n"
"You tell her to ask Aliki why she is looking for this place, and the two begin conversing again. “She says that she thinks some of the Coterie were—” She pauses for a moment, struggling with the translation. “—taken? But how could that be? Our records indicate they’re accounted for. At least, the ones we know about.” You consider all that you have seen, and a nauseous feeling overtakes you. Is it possible for both to be true? Is it possible some in the Coterie are not what they seem?\n"
"You approach and ask Aliki if she would like to travel with you to this gateway, if it exists. Quinn tentatively translates your request, and the mysterious figure nods in response. Resolve, strange and fierce, like a piercing light in the abyss, fills your heart. You lift the raven whistle and say that you will summon her when you are ready. This time, Aliki nods without even waiting for Quinn’s translation. You catch just a glimpse of piercing red eyes, framed with heavy bangs, as the wind picks up again and sends her hair aflutter. You lift your coat to block the bitter chill, and naught but a moment later, Aliki Uperetria is gone, wisped along with the wind itself.\n"
"You ask Quinn if she will stick with you a little longer. “I’m not going to lie, this terrifies me,” she says in a small voice, “but I think we are on to something here. Yes. I will see this through with you to the very end. I just hope…” she quivers and averts her gaze away from you. “I just hope I am still remembered when this is done."

"“这……可能是我做过最糟糕的决定。”奎茵探员在你们攀登巴拉丁诺山时抱怨到。无数神庙的遗迹遍布这个区域，原本用光亮的白色大理石，还有精巧象牙浮雕与精雕细琢雕像建成的宏伟神庙，现在只剩下破碎的残骸跟断垣残壁。你尽力安抚奎茵，但她是对的，到头来这可能只是一场空，或甚至是个陷阱。调查官泰勒如果知道她的探员们与绯红结社的成员合作，可能不会太高兴。但你认为阿利琪对这些在全世界发生的消失事件知道的更多，而解决它也许比调查官泰勒给你的任务更加重要。奎茵叹气并点头同意：“我知道，这就是为什么我会来这里。但是……”她突然停下来，好像看见远方有某个东西，然后开始朝那个方向前进。“那边，那些是奥古斯都宫殿的遗址，据说就是他在附近建造了巴拉丁诺山阿波罗神庙。很多学者都认为邻近的遗址属于朱比特胜利神庙，但我敢打赌它其实是阿波罗的。”\n"
"你叹口气并将阿利琪给你的白色渡鸦哨子拿出来，现在是放手一试的最好时机。最坏的情况不过就是你浪费了自己跟奎茵的时间罢了。你吹响了哨子，远方传来一声类似从加德满都就开始困扰著你的低泣声。风势逐渐增强，变得凛冽，奎茵打了个冷颤将外套拉紧。接著，就像风一样快速，她来了。\n"
"阿利琪·佐妮·乌佩雷特里亚站在神庙的遗迹上，红色丝带在强风中飘荡。在风势跟哨声减弱后，她的头发重新遮住了脸庞，掩饰住她的表情。“希望你知道自己在做什么。”奎茵边对你呢喃著边不安的走上前接近那个飘渺的身影。红丝带少女吐出一句古埃及语，奎茵停下脚步友善的回应，阿利琪歪著头，露出了理解且饶有兴趣的反应。慢慢的，一个字一个字，她们开始了对话，每几句就切换一次语言，像两个学生在测试彼此一样。你惊叹地看著她们像呼吸一样自然的说著古老语言。\n"
"终于，奎茵示意你上前。“你是对的，她正在找寻那些你遭遇的存在的……”阿利琪再度开口，奎茵翻译到：“去处。她认为被牠们夺走，不对，吞噬的东西，会去到某个地方。她正在搜寻它们被带去了哪里。”你问奎茵她是否能想到地球上哪个地方非常频繁的发生类似事件。她回答：“我只想到一个：百慕达三角，又称为恶魔三角，在大西洋。有许多船只甚至飞机都在那个区域离奇失踪，我们很努力掩盖这些事故。我的档案中也有一些相关的记录，那里会不会是某种……通道？”\n"
"你请奎茵询问阿利琪为什么想找到这个地方，她们两个再度开始交谈。“她说她认为有一些结社成员被——”她停顿了一下，思考著适当的用词，“被带走了？但怎么可能？我们的情报指出是他们在控制这一切，至少是我们所知的那一位成员在控制。”你回想自己经历过的事，突然感到一阵反胃。或许两边都是对的？或许一些结社成员不像外表看起来那样？\n"
"你走上前询问阿利琪是否愿意跟你一同前往那个通道，如果它真的存在的话。奎茵谨慎的翻译你的要求，然后那个神秘的身影同意了。你的决心就像刺破黑暗深渊的曙光一般，在你心中熊熊燃烧。你拿起渡鸦哨子，说在你准备就绪时会召唤她前来。阿利琪立刻点头同意，甚至没等奎茵进行翻译。你看见她眼中闪过一道红光，接著风声大作，将她的头发吹起。你拉起衣领抵挡凛冽的强风，一瞬间后，阿利琪·乌佩雷特里亚就随著强风一齐消失了。\n"
"你问奎茵是否愿意再陪你走一段路。“说实话，我吓坏了。”她小声地说。“但我觉得我们正在做真正重要的事。我的答案是愿意，我会陪你到最后。我只希望……”她颤抖著将视线移开，“我只希望结束后我还能记得这一切。”"

"Several fruitless days of searching for leads in Rome brings you to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitol Hill. Nestled among dozens of ancient statues is a bronze sculpture of the Lupa Capitolina depicting two twin babies suckling from a mother wolf. Your guide explains the twins are Romulus and Remus, the two alleged founders of Rome. “According to legend, the king, afraid for his claim to the throne, ordered them to be drowned in the Tiber. The twins were protected by the gods and taken in by a she-wolf who raised and fed them as her own. They lived in a cave until they were found and brought to safety.”\n"
"The guide leads the tour past another gallery filled with empty pedestals. You ask your guide what was on display before. “Nothing,” he chuckles. You comment on the number of empty rooms and displays, and the guide laughs dismissively. “Much has been lost over the years,” he says. Looking out over the city skyline, filled with odd dips and empty gaps, you wonder if Rome itself is disappearing."

"经历几天毫无收获的调查后，你来到了卡比托利欧山上的保守宫。在古老建筑群的中央是一座母狼乳婴的青铜雕像，雕像本身是一头母狼正在为两名人类婴儿哺乳的画面。导游解释那对双胞胎是罗穆卢斯与瑞摩斯，罗马城的创立者。他说：“传说中国王担心他们会夺取王位，下令将他们溺死在台伯河中。但这对双胞胎受到神明的保护，并被一头母狼当作亲生孩子一般养大，他们生活在洞穴中，一直到有人找到他们并保护他们长大。”\n"
"那名导游领著游客经过一个艺廊，其中有许多基座都是空的，你询问导游这里以前展示著什么东西。他轻笑著说：“什么都没有。”你指出过多空置的展示位是很不寻常的状况，但导游只是不在意地说：“漫长岁月中很多展品都遗失了。”你看向罗马城的天际线，有许多奇怪的缺口跟不和谐的线条，你怀疑是否罗马城本身也在逐渐消失。"
