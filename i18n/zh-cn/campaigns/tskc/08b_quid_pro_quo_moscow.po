"The Foundation’s base of operations in Moscow is just a five minute walk from St. Basil’s Cathedral: a nondescript door set into a modern constructivist structure overlooking a cobbled street. The corridor inside feeds into a cramped stairwell that descends deeper than you could have anticipated, to a red door set in a flaking whitewashed wall. After identifying yourself, you are led into a long well-lit hallway with lavish carpeting.\n"
"“It seems you follow instructions well,” says a voice. You turn to see a tall, athletic woman in a well-tailored suit. “Valeriya Antonova. We have met before. Call me Lera. Please, follow me.” Agent Antonova leads you through a labyrinthine set of passageways, past a set of double doors, to a white-tiled room flecked with grime and what you hope is red rust. On an operating table in the center, what looks like a person is strapped to a metal slab, restrained with tight leather straps. Looking at the humanoid shape makes your head swim: its features are blurred as if in constant motion, like a hummingbird in flight. You catch only glimpses of its features: a stygian eye, clenched teeth, nervous twitching.\n"
"“Lera,” another agent interrupts. “The Komissar needs your attention.” Agent Antonova looks sternly to you. “This is a paradimensional being. Please keep your distance. I will be but a moment away.” The agent leaves. As you look at the sharp implements mounted to the wall of the lab, you wonder what experiments the being has endured. Judging by the subject’s well-tailored black suit, you wonder if it used to be a Foundation agent. After a minute of silence, it begins to flail around on the table, widening and shrinking its “mouth” to a wide dark O, always facing you. You keep your distance, trying to look away.\n"
"“Please excuse me,” Agent Antonova re-enters the room. The being on the table stops flailing. “There is another matter I must attend to. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to escort you around our facilities, so I must ask you to leave. However, the Foundation does wish to assist in any way it can. Please tell us what we can do for you.”"

"基石在莫斯科的设施离圣巴希尔教堂只有五分钟的路程。你走进一栋眺望鹅卵石街道的结构主义的现代建筑，里面有一扇没标注任何东西的门。门后的走廊引领你到一座狭窄的楼梯井，你走下意想之外的深度，站在一面白墙上的红色大门前，在通报身份后，你被带进铺著豪华地毯、照明良好的廊道。\n"
"“看来你有仔细看指示。”一个声音说到。你转身看见一名高挑匀称的女性，穿著合身的西装。“我是瓦蕾莉雅·安东诺娃。我们之前见过，你可以叫我蕾拉。请随我来。”安东诺娃探员带领你穿越迷宫般的走道，走过一扇双层门，进入一个铺著白色地砖的房间，你暗自希望墙上红色的斑点指是铁锈的痕迹。在中央的手术台上有一个人型的身影被用皮带绑在金属制的台面上。看著这个人型身影，你感到一阵晕眩，它的身形模糊，就像是蜂鸟快速振动翅膀产生的残影。你只能辨认出一些特征：阴森的双眼、咬牙切齿的表情，跟紧绷的抽搐。\n"
"“蕾拉，调查官找你。”一名探员打断你们。安东诺娃探员严肃的看向你说：“这是一个超次元的产物，请保持安全距离，我马上回来。”然后离开了。你看著实验室墙上的锐利工具，不禁想像这个生物正经历什么样的实验。就牠身上合身的西装来看，牠也许曾经是一名基石探员。在一阵寂静后，牠开始剧烈挣扎，牠的“嘴巴”张开又收缩，形成一个诡异的黑色圆形，而且牠一直面向你的方向。你保持距离，试著不去看牠。\n"
"“我很抱歉。”安东诺娃探员回到了房间。台子上的生物不再挣扎。“我必须去处理其他事，很不幸的是我们没有其他人员能带你在设施中流览，所以我必须请你离开了。但基石希望能尽力帮助你，请告诉我我们能帮上你什么忙?”"

msgid "Agent Antonova digs through some old files and pulls out a dossier filled with information on a man named Desiderio Delgado Álvarez. “From what we can tell, ‘Subject #28–I lived a perfectly mundane life in Havana until the age of 19, when his involvement with organized crime drew the attention of the Coterie. “ You wonder aloud if he is a rum-runner, and she shakes her head sternly. “Quite the opposite, in fact. Desiderio’s brother was the one involved in such matters, before his murder at the hands of a rival gang. It seems Desiderio then acquired a Key, and was using it to take revenge. Hence the Coterie involvement. Seeing his talent, they decided to induct him.”"
msgstr "安东诺娃探员在一叠档案中翻找，最后拉出一份写著德西德里奥·德尔加多·阿瓦雷兹名字的档案。“就我们所知，目标#28-I在19岁前都过著非常平凡的生活。一直到他涉入组织犯罪时才引起结社的注意。”你开口问是不是因为走私兰姆酒，但她摇摇头说：“正好相反，他的哥哥才是在做这个勾当的，至少一直到他被敌对帮派杀害前。看起来德西德里奥不知从哪取得了一件密钥，并利用它来复仇。最后结社介入，由于他展现出的潜力，他们将他吸收进组织中。”"
