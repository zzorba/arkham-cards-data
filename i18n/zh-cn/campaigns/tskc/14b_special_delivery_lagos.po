"Following a set of coded directions from the Foundation, you follow a packed road to a small cafe in the heart of Lagos. Seated on a veranda overlooking a bustling market is Commissioner Taylor, nursing a glass filled with a deep red liquid. As you approach, she shuffles a deck of playing cards with one hand and looks up at you.\n"
"“You can clearly follow directions,” she says, gesturing for you to sit across from her. “But do you know how to play whist?” A warm breeze stirs the air as you take your seat and Taylor deals you each thirteen cards, then reveals the top of the deck: a one-eyed jack. “Now talk.” As you play, the commissioner asks you questions about your findings around the globe. As the final trump card is revealed, Taylor looks you dead in the eyes.\n"
"“We have identified thirteen members of the Coterie so far, but evidence suggests there are more. Far more. Even if we catch one, the organization will persist. And that’s to speak nothing of their many operatives and minions. It would be like trying to remove an anthill by catching individual ants.” You ask the commissioner what she is getting at and she lays down her last card with a smirk. “The way to bring them down is to cut them off at their source.”\n"
"You play your last card: a near loss. Taylor gathers the cards up. “I win this time, but I look forward to our next game,” she sips her drink. “Do not forget what I said. Find where they congregate.” As she speaks, a towering suit approaches from the side of the building and whispers in her ear. “I am sorry to cut this short, but I have business in Monaco. Unfortunately, I don’t have time to deliver these documents—see that these reach our operatives in Tokyo.”"

"你跟著基石一段加密讯息的指示走，走进一间在拉哥斯市中心繁忙街道上的咖啡厅。坐在阳台上俯视著热闹市场的人正是调查官泰勒。她拿著一杯装著深红色液体的玻璃杯，你走近时，她正用另一只手洗著一副扑克牌。\n"
"“看来你很擅长跟从指示。”她边说边示意你坐在她对面。“那你也擅长玩惠斯特牌吗？”一阵温暖的微风吹来，泰勒发给你们一人13张牌，然后翻开牌库第一张卡：是一张独眼杰克。“现在，说吧。”你们进行游戏的同时，调查官询问你在世界各地调查的收获。当最后一张王牌翻出时，她看著你的眼睛。\n"
"“我们已经取得13名结社成员的身份了，但有证据指出他们有更多成员，远超这个数字。就算我们抓到一个，这个组织仍会继续活动，对其他成员根本不会造成影响。就像想靠著抓一只蚂蚁来摧毁蚁丘一样徒劳。”你询问调查官她讲这些的意思是什么，她笑著打出最后一张卡：“唯一打倒他们的方法就是从根源动手。”\n"
"你打出最后一张卡：惜败。泰勒将牌整理起来。“这次我赢了，但我期待下次对决。”她啜了一口饮料。“别忘了我说的，找出他们的核心。”当她说话时，一个高大的西装男从另一边走来，并在她耳边说了些什么。“我很抱歉要先结束这场会谈，我得前往摩纳哥处理事情。很遗憾我不能亲自运送这份文件，请将它交给我们在东京的探员。”"

msgid "After putting into port, you find a warehouse marked with 39-0 and a logo of a red lion, per the instructions given to you by the Foundation. Once inside, you deliver Commissioner Taylor’s documents to a steely-eyed operative, who thanks you before melting into the shadows."
msgstr "你在港口下船后，跟随指示找到一间标记39-0的仓库，上面还有一个红色狮子的图案。你走进仓库，将调查官泰勒的文件交给一名眼神坚毅的探员，他向你道谢后就消失在阴影之中。"
