"It’s a good thing the locals here are fairly welcoming and don’t seem to mind you asking directions, because “abandoned cigar factory” doesn’t exactly narrow things down. The bustling Ybor City district near Tampa is home to many such factories built and run by thousands of immigrants from all over. If you had to check each and every factory, you’d be here all week. Luckily, you have a lead just north of the bay: a quiet, run-down building with an adjoining boarded-up warehouse. If you didn’t know the truth, you’d think it was nothing more than an out-of-date factory from the ’80s, probably filled with nothing more than dust and rats. But if you’ve learned anything in your travels, it’s to never trust the evidence of your eyes.\n"
"You cautiously approach the main entrance and attempt to open it. As you suspected, it does not budge. If this is truly a Coterie sanctum, it’ll be harder than that to get inside. There’s no easy way in through the third-story windows, so you circle around the side of the warehouse, spotting a large metal door likely used for loading goods or unloading supplies. As there is no handle or lever, you decide to knock. A moment later, a gruff voice responds from the other side: “Passphrase.”"

"幸好当地人热情好客，而且不介意为你指引方向，因为“废弃的雪茄厂”根本无助于缩小范围。在这个邻近坦帕的繁荣区域有许多这种由大量移民人口经营的工厂。如果你得一家一家搜索，那你可能得在这里待上一整个礼拜。幸运的是，你在海湾北边找到了一间安静的老旧建筑，旁边还有加盖的仓库。如果你没得到情报，也会以为这里只是一座上个世纪留下的过时工厂，里面可能只有灰尘跟老鼠。但如果这一场旅途教会了你什么，那就是眼见不一定为凭。\n"
"你小心的靠近主要入口并试著推开门，如你所想，它纹丝不动。如果这里真的是结社的据点，那你当然没这么容易能进去。看起来也不可能从三层楼高的窗户进入，所以你绕到仓库侧面，发现一个巨大的金属门，也许是用来装卸货物的地方。门上没有任何把手，所以你决定敲门。一段时间后，门另一边传来一个粗哑的声音说：“暗号？”"

"You lean in and utter the words that Desi taught you—”Blackbird Solitaire”—and the door slides open. On the other side, a muscular man with a thick mustache gives you a toothy grin. The hand hovering just over the handle of a revolver holstered at his side gives you pause, but after a moment, he steps aside to let you in. “Boss said you might be stopping by,” the doorman says. “He said to let you look around and take whatever you need.”\n"
"You step inside and eye the man carefully. Last thing you need is a bullet in the back just as soon as you begin your search. As if sensing your concern, he slowly unholsters his gun and empties the cylinder. “Look, friend. I know what you did for Desi. Any friend of his is a friend of mine,” he states, meeting your suspicious gaze head-on. “Whatever you’re looking for, it’s yours.”\n"
"It doesn’t take too long for you to find the Key Desi had stashed here. Mounted on a far wall of the warehouse, over a midst of a trove of supplies and ammunition, its alien sheen reflects a warped view of your startled countenance. It is a double-edged blade of considerable length, although it has no handle or grip with which to wield it. It might be a weapon, but it is no mortal one, that is for sure.\n"
"“That old thing?” the gruff man asks as you delicately remove it from its mount. “Just a weird hunk of metal, that is. Thought Desi just kept it here for kicks. Creeps the hell out of me.” As you hold the blade over both of your hands, a gentle pulse of energy quivers through its length. Not a decoration, then—this is the real deal.\n"
"You also sift througth some of Desi’s records and intel while you are here. Not much that you don’t already know, but it looks like he’s been keeping tabs on a few of his cohorts. There are more than a few clandestine photographs of a woman carrying a red parasol over her shoulder. In the clearest of these, the woman is giving the camera a knowing smirk. She knew Desi was on to her. On the back, in sloppy handwriting, black ink reads: “You’re in too deep this time, Tzu.”\n"
"You browse a bit more, but you aren’t going to find much else here. Desi’s operation is quite a bit different from the Coterie’s stated goals, it seems. Perhaps there is more to them than the Foundation believes. Or, it’s just another front. Doesn’t matter. You have what you came for."

"你向前靠说出德西告诉你的暗号——“黑鸟钻石”，然后门滑开了。一名壮硕的大胡子男人对你露齿而笑，但当看见他悬在腰间手枪上的手时，你僵硬了一下。不过他马上让到一边放你进去。他开口说：“老大说你可能会来。他还说你可以到处看看，想拿什么都可以。”\n"
"你踏进仓库，但警戒的看著那个男人，你最不希望的就是在搜索时背后挨子弹。那名门卫似乎感觉到你的顾虑，他慢慢的将枪从腰间拔出来并清空枪膛。“朋友你看，我知道你为德西做的事，德西的朋友就是我朋友。”他边说边对上你怀疑的眼神。“不管你是来找什么，它都是你的了。”\n"
"你很快就找到德西存放在这里的密钥。它挂在仓库深处的一面墙上，在大量的补给品跟弹药之间。它散发著异样的光芒，你惊叹的表情歪斜的倒映在它的表面。这是一把相当长的双刃匕首，但没有刀柄可供抓握。这是一把武器，但显然不是来自凡间的。\n"
"“你要的是那个老东西？”那个粗旷的男人在你小心的将密钥拿下来时问到。“那是一块奇怪的金属，德西只是一时好玩把它放在这，但它让我浑身都不对劲。”你双手握住它时，感觉到一股力量的脉动从刀身传来。虽然外表朴素，但它绝对是致命的武器。\n"
"你顺便翻看了一些德西的调查纪录，虽然大多数都是你已知的情报，但看起来德西正在追查几位他的同胞。许多照片中都有一名拿著鲜红色阳伞的女子，其中一张最清楚的照片中，那名女子正对著镜头微笑，看来她早就知道德西在追踪她。照片背面有段潦草的字迹写著：“妳陷得太深了，梓。”\n"
"你又到处看了一下，但没有再找到什么值得关注的东西。德西的行动似乎跟结社的目标相违背，看来结社也许比基石想像的更复杂，又或许这只是他们其中一个伪装。不重要了，你已经达成来这里的目的了。"
