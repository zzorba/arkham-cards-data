"A chill breeze flutters through the streets of Kathmandu, along with a faint, shrill whine. To the north, the Himalayas loom over the city, only their peaks illuminated by the westward sun. Pinks and purples bathe the sky in vibrant beauty. You could stare at such a breathtaking sight forever… but you have a job to do. Despite the quiet, peaceful evening, that soft, sharp piping does not cease, like an aching sense of dread in the back of your mind. As the evening drags on and the whistling grows louder, you realize you are the only one who can hear the strange sound. It feels as though it is reaching out to you directly. As if it hears you, too. As if it knows you. On a whim, you close your eyes and strain yourself to listen closer. It’s difficult to tell where exactly the sound is coming from—it seems to waft all around you and echo throughout the streets—but it grows in volume as you round the nearest corner and head north. And so north you continue.\n"
"Eventually, you reach an art gallery nestled between several age-old buildings. The whistling here is fevered and unpleasant, like a boiling kettle. Though the gallery is closed at this late hour, you are able to easily find an open side entrance. You brace yourself and enter the gallery, where dozens of Nepalese sculptures and paintings are on display—many carved out of wood or stone, others made out of ashtadhatu, an amalgam of eight different metals, and still others made of terra cotta. The whistling suddenly stops the moment you reach the rearmost section of the gallery, where a single lot remains strangely empty. There is no trace of what might have been there; just an empty space where something historic and treasured is clearly meant to be. Then, a lone voice pierces the sudden quiet, speaking in a language you do not understand.\n"
"You turn on your heels, body tensing. On the other end of the hall is a girl dressed in white, her figure seemingly ethereal in the faint beams of fading sunlight that permeate through the building. Her long black hair is draped over her face, masking her expression. A long scarlet sash wrapped around her waist flutters behind her, despite the fact that there is no breeze.\n"
"You freeze. The figure of the girl does not move. Her hair and sash drift steadily in the stillness. Then, she speaks once more. Again, you don’t understand a single word of it, though you notice that she has switched languages. Recognizing a few root words, you realize she is using Latin. She speaks again, this time in what sounds like ancient Greek. If she is trying to communicate with you, it may be wise to play along. You ask her what she is doing here; why she guided you here. Her response is in yet another language that eludes you, this one sounding somewhat like a blend of Egyptian and Greek."

"一阵冷风带著刺耳的鸣响吹过加德满都的街道。北方，喜马拉雅山脉高耸的矗立著，山峰被落日的余光染成红色，粉色与紫色将天空染成鲜艳的画作。你可以看著这幅美景直到永远……但你有工作得做。即使在安宁平静的夜晚，尖锐的哨声依然没有止息，不安感在你脑后徘徊。夜色渐浓，哨声也随之增大，你发现只有自己能听见这个怪声，就像它直接与你连结，就像它也在聆听你；就像它认识你一样。你闭上眼睛专注在听力上，很难辨识声音是从哪里传来的，它感觉围绕著你，同时在街道之间产生回音。但当你向北走时，音量越来越大，所以你继续向北方前进。\n"
"哨声引领你来到一间混杂在数座古老建筑间的艺廊，哨声变的刺耳恼人，像煮沸的茶壶。虽然艺廊在这个时间已经关门，你还是设法从侧门进入了。你小心的走进艺廊，看见许多尼泊尔的画作与雕塑，大多是以木石为材料，有些使用埃什塔都——一种八种金属混合的合金，还有一些陶制品。哨声在你走到艺廊末端时倏然而止，你站在一个空的展示格前。你看不出这里原本应该放著什么东西，但明显应该要有某种文物或宝物放在这里。突然，有一个孤寂的声音打破寂静，说著你不懂的语言。\n"
"你紧绷的转过身，在大厅的另一端有一名全身白色的少女，她的身影在透进来的夕阳余光下显得飘渺虚无。黑色的长发遮住了她的脸庞，一条长长的红丝带系在她的腰间。虽然没有风，但丝带却在她身后飘荡。\n"
"你僵住了，少女的身影也纹丝不动，但她的头发与丝带却依然在无风的状况下飘动。她再度开口，你依然无法辨认，但你发现她换了一种语言。你从几个单字中听出她正说著拉丁文。接著似乎是古希腊文，她似乎正尝试与你沟通。也许跟著尝试会是好主意，你开始询问为什么她在这里？为什么引领你来这？她用另一个你听不懂的语言回应，这次听起来像是埃及跟希腊语的混合。"

msgid "In your travels, you’ve been to quite a few places. You’re no stranger to different languages. You attempt a few of your own, but each time you are met with silence. And yet, she appears to want to communicate with you, and is consistently switching languages herself, only without any overlap. Is she only able to speak in long-dead languages?"
msgstr "你在旅行中曾到过许多地方，你对不同的语言并不陌生。你也尝试了几种，但只得到沉默的回应。她看起来很想跟你沟通，不断变换著不同语言，但你们找不到共通的语言。难道她只会说已经绝迹的语言吗？"

msgid "Due to the language barrier, it’s difficult to get a sense for what she wants from you. As you attempt to decipher her intent, she approaches slowly, her steps making no sound whatsoever along the wooden floor. She gestures to the empty lot next to you and whistles softly, as though the sound might carry with it some meaning. You wonder if perhaps there might have once been something here, and then realize: it is gone, vanished from history without so much as a trace. You recall the woman’s name from the Foundation’s dossier and ask her if she is also on the trail of the entities responsible for these kinds of disappearances. Aliki Uperetria does not seem to understand you, but she tilts her head in recognition at the sound of her own name. Then she wrenches something from around her neck and extends it to you in a closed fist."
msgstr "由于语言障碍，你很难理解她希望你做什么。你正尝试分析她的意图时，她慢慢靠近，她的脚踏在木地板上却没发出任何声音。她指向空荡的展示格并小声吹著口哨，好像声音本身代表著某种意义。你思考著原本放在这里的可能是什么东西，然后你灵光一闪：它一定是消失了，从历史中被抹去。你想起卷宗上少女的名字，追问她是否也在调查造成这一切消失事件的存在。阿利琪·乌佩雷特里亚看似听不懂你的话，但听到名字时歪了歪头，似乎认出了自己的名字。接著她从脖子上拿下某样东西握在手中伸向你。"

msgid "You extend your hand, and a small device on a silver chain falls into your palm. It is a whistle, carved out of bone to look like the head and beak of a white raven. Glancing back up at Aliki, she points toward the plaque next to the empty lot and says something once more in what sounds to you like Latin. You ask what she is after, and what the significance of the whistle is, but she remains cryptically silent. Turning over the whistle in your hand, you find no markings or clues as to its purpose. When you glance back up to question Aliki, she has vanished, replaced once more with a cold wind that seeps into your skin. Then, though no one else seems to hear it, the piping returns, soul-wrenching, ear-splitting. It does not cease for as long as the whistle remains in your possession."
msgstr "你伸出手，一个连著银色炼条的物品掉入你的掌中，是一个骨雕的哨子，外型是一只白色渡鸦的头。你抬头看阿利琪，她指向空置展示格的铭牌，然后再次用拉丁文说了些什么。你问她想要什么，这个哨子又象征著什么，但她依然保持沉默。你将哨子在手中翻转检视，没看见任何透露它功能的记号跟线索。当你再次抬头想询问阿利琪时，她已经消失了，只留下一阵刺骨的冷风。接著尖锐刺耳的哨声又回来了，但似乎除了你没人听见。只要你还带著那个哨子，哨音似乎永不会停息。"

msgstr "拒绝阿利琪。"

msgid "You back away with caution. If a member of the Coterie—especially one as cryptic and potentially dangerous as Aliki—is offering you something, it can’t mean anything good. Besides, your mission is to ensure they cannot collect any more Keys, not to cooperate with them… right? Aliki’s hand lowers, along with the temperature in the room. She seems to sense your mistrust and return it tenfold, though she no longer attempts to speak. Moments later, the cold wind returns, and to your surprise, she is gone."
msgstr "你谨慎地退后，如果结社的成员，尤其是像阿利琪这样诡异且有潜在危险的人，想给你东西时,一定不会有什么好事。而且，你的任务是阻止他们得到更多密钥，而不是跟他们合作，对吧……？阿利琪放下手，气温突然也下降了几度，她看似感应到了你的不信任，也随之做出相同反应，不再试著跟你说话。过了一会儿，冷风再度吹来，而你很惊讶的发现她突然消失了。"
