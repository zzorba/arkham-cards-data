msgid "A cool breeze greets you as you arrive in Perth. The capital of Western Australia is nestled in the crook of the Swan River, and despite—or perhaps because of—the nearby gold rush, it has the rugged feel of a frontier town. You catch a scent of something too sweet, possibly rotten, on the breeze."
msgstr "一阵冷风在你抵达伯斯时迎面吹来。这座澳洲西部的首府城市座落在斯旺河的环抱中，也许是因为附近的淘金潮，这里有拓荒小镇般的粗旷感。你在风中嗅到一个过于甜腻的气味，似乎有什么东西腐坏了。"

"You find Dr. Irawan at the local university cleaning up an empty lecture hall. On the blackboard is a precise chalk drawing of a stocky marsupial clutching a cluster of sedge grass.\n"
"“I did not expect to see you here,” the zoologist sets to erasing the blackboard. You ask about the sketch. “It is a rare species of quokka: the red-tailed quokka. They were first introduced to the West by Dutch explorers in the 17th century. And now no one—not even the Cambridge professor who taught me their name—remember what they are.”\n"
"“I do not know how much you have studied natural selection, but what we are experiencing feels very much like the introduction of a new apex predator into an ecosystem that has not evolved to withstand it,” says the zoologist. “Except that this predator feeds not only on the body, but on the actual existence of its prey. Although, of course, that would be unthinkable,” she laughs. “But I cannot help feeling that we are its prey. And the process is only accelerating.” The zoologist sits down and begins to flip idly through a sketchbook.\n"
"Thinking on the terms the Foundation used, you suggest she name the phenomena “Paranatural Selection.” She looks troubled at the suggestion, then smiles.\n"
"“I will be sure to credit you,” she says, then goes pale. You look down and see her gaze fixed on a particular page in her sketchbook. “This cannot be.”\n"
"You ask her what the matter is, and she points to the page. “Just yesterday, this page was not blank. The <i>Phalanger septimus</i>. A cuscus living in western New Guinea.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan begins gathering up her things. “I sketched this subject from direct observation just months ago. Perhaps there will be some trace of it—or of whatever force is behind all this—out in Manokwari.” She pushes a strand of hair behind her ear and smiles at you. “Thank you for listening. Perhaps we will meet again.”"

"你在当地的大学一间空荡荡的演讲厅找到伊拉万博士。黑板上用粉笔画著一只矮小，像是袋鼠的生物，前爪抓著一把莎草。\n"
"“没想到会在这里见到你。”那位动物学家起身擦去黑板上的图画。你询问那个素描是什么。“这是一个稀有的物种：红尾矮袋鼠。牠们第一次被西方世界发现是在17世纪，由荷兰的探险家发现。但现在所有人，包括在剑桥大学教会我牠们名字的教授，都失去了关于牠们的记忆。”\n"
"“我不确定你对物竞天择的学说了解多少，但我们现在面临的情就如同一种新的顶级掠食者闯入一个还没演化到能承受牠存在的生态系。更糟的是这个掠食者不只吞噬血肉，而是连同猎物的存在本身也一并抹去。虽然这假设实在是太荒唐了。”动物学家笑了起来。“但我还是不禁感觉我们也是牠的猎物之一。而这种状况正在加速发生。”伊拉万博士坐下，开始随意的翻著她的素描本。\n"
"你想到基石的研究，建议她可以称这个现象为“悖常天择”。她思索了一下这个称呼，然后微笑。\n"
"“我一定会标明这个词的出处的。”她笑著说。然后她的脸色瞬间变白，你看见她的视线落在素描本上的某一页。“这不可能啊。你问发生了什么事，她指著那页说：“它昨天还不是空白的，赛提米乌斯貂，一种生活在新几内亚西部的袋貂。”\n"
"伊拉万博士开始收拾东西。“我几个月前才在直接目击时画下这份素描。也许在曼洛瓦里会有造成这一切元凶的线索。”她将一丝头发拨到耳后对你说：“感谢你的聆听，也许我们会再见面。”"

msgid "Upon arriving in the city, you look for Dr. Irawan at the local university. A helpful professor scours the academic schedule on your behalf when you mention Dr. Irawan’s lecture, but finds nothing. You take out the card she gave you, but both sides are blank. It’s as though she has vanished completely…"
msgstr "你抵达城市后，前往当地的大学寻找伊拉万博士。一位热心的教授帮你在时程表上查询伊拉万博士的讲座时间，但却没有任何记录。你拿出她的名片，发现只剩下一片空白，就像是她完全消失了一样……"

"You catch Dr. Irawan walking out of a lecture at the local university and invite her to a nearby cafe to chat about her research. On a sunlit veranda, she lays several life-like sketches out on the table between you. “Have you ever heard of the red-tailed quokka?” she asks. You shake your head. “They were first introduced to the West by Dutch explorers in the 17th century, and have been listed in standard taxonomy since then. I learned about them at Cambridge.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan leafs through a sketchbook to a blank page. “On a survey five years ago, I took several sketches in the wild. But recently, I opened my books and the sketches were blank, as if they had never been drawn. Moreover, every footnote and reference to them in academia has vanished. I asked my professor at Cambridge—the man who taught me what red-tailed quokkas were—and he looked at me as though I had gone mad.” The zoologist adjusts her large spectacles.\n"
"You assure Dr. Irawan that she is not mad, and share what little you can about the disappearances.\n"
"“I do not know how much you have studied natural selection, but what we are experiencing feels very much like the introduction of a new apex predator into an ecosystem that has not evolved to withstand it,” says the zoologist. “Except that this predator feeds not only on the body, but on the actual existence of its prey. Although, of course, that would be unthinkable,” she laughs. “But I cannot help feeling that we are its prey.”\n"
"Thinking on the terms the Foundation used, you suggest she name the phenomena “Paranatural Selection.” She looks troubled at the suggestion, then smiles.\n"
"“Perhaps I will use that, with your permission,” says Dr. Irawan. “I am glad we met. I was beginning to think this was all in my head.” She gives you her business card with the name of a hotel in Brazil written on the back. “I will be in Rio de Janeiro to continue my survey, and my next lecture. Perhaps I will see you there.”"

"伊拉万博士在当地大学的讲座结束时，你邀请她到附近的咖啡店讨论她的研究。在阳光普照的露台上，她拿出几张栩栩如生的素描放到你们之间的桌上。“你有听过红尾矮袋鼠吗？”她问到。你摇摇头。“牠们第一次被西方世界发现是在17世纪，由荷兰的探险家发现。之后就被列入物种列表中，我是在剑桥大学学到关于牠们的知识。”\n"
"伊拉万博士翻到素描本中空白的一页。“我在五年前的一次调查中画了几张牠们的素描。但最近我打开画本时，却是一片空白，就像我从来没画过牠们一样。更糟糕的是，所有关于牠们的学术记录跟笔记都消失了。我询问剑桥的教授，就是当年教导我的那位教授，他居然像看疯子一样看著我。”这位动物学家推了推她的眼镜。\n"
"你向伊拉万博士保证她没有疯，并分享了一些你对于消失事件的所见所闻。\n"
"“我不确定你对物竞天择的学说了解多少，但我们现在面临的情况就如同一种新的顶级掠食者闯入一个还没演化到能承受牠存在的生态系。更糟的是这个掠食者不只吞噬血肉，而是连同猎物的存在本身也一并抹去。虽然这假设实在是太荒唐了。”动物学家笑了起来。“但我还是不禁感觉我们也是牠的猎物之一。”\n"
"你想到基石的研究，建议她可以称这个现象为“悖常天择”。她思索了一下这个称呼，然后微笑。\n"
"“也许我会采用，如果你同意的话。”伊拉万博士说。“很高兴认识你，我差点开始以为这一切都是幻觉了。”她给了你一张名片，背后写著一间巴西饭店的地址。“我会在里约热内卢继续研究跟准备下一次发表会，也许你可以到那跟我碰面。”"
