"You have only just checked into your lodge in Anchorage when you receive an unmarked package:\n"
"<typewriter>\tAgents,</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tWe have lost contact with several operatives in central Alaska in recent weeks, likely due to Coterie activity. One operative was looking into a possible lead: a lens with apparent paradimensional capabilities. Enclosed is the journal of prospector Rhett Landry, currently institutionalized at Morningside Sanatorium in Oregon.</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tIf the lens is a Key, acquire it at all costs.</typewriter>\n"
"<right><fancy>~Q. Taylor</fancy></right>\n"
"You spend a full day poring over the prospector’s journal, which is mostly comprised of wildlife sketches and notes on mining. However, the final entry is chilling:\n"
"<blockquote>“<i>October the 4th, 1923:</i>\n"
"<i>Tonight, I bury that accursed lens where I found it.</i>\n"
"<i>I dared not commit my thoughts to the page after finding it, but I have nothing to lose now. While surveying the new branch in the mine, I found a curious lens buried in the rock. It was opaque and emanated a beguiling light. Holding it made me feel special. As if I had been chosen. Looking through it, I saw incredible plants, creatures, people, structures, in a strange otherworldly landscape. A world beyond our own. A world that should exist. A dark reflection of our own: a haven for lost objects, lost memories. The lens—the Sable Glass—is the mirror that shows the truth of this other world.</i>\n"
"<i>How foolish was I to think I could use the lens for my own gain! The more I looked at the other world, the more the other world looked back. By peering into the glass, I must have called something—some awful, nameless creature—through. More and more of my fellow prospectors went missing in the woods and erased from memory. My companions, my possessions, my home: all were swallowed by the strange creature I glimpsed in the Sable Glass. And now when I look through it, I can see them, there, in that other place.</i>\n"
"<i>The creature that stalks the woods is made of nothing, and yet it is many things: constantly shifting, ever-changing. It has the traits of many animals, like a chimera from old myths. I tried to hunt it using the Sable Glass, but looking at it made my head spin. After surveying the area, I set a trap and thought I killed one of its forms: a great lupine thing that howled and dissipated into nothingness. But when I returned to camp the next day, it had struck the camp. My companions have vanished from memory and space.</i>\n"
"<i>The authorities say I should be locked up. My only hope is to set things right, to put the Sable Glass back where I found it. Perhaps then everything will be right again.”</i>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"Next to the journal entry is an array of dark scratches, which you had assumed were nervous scribbles. However, given Landry’s account, you wonder if it isn’t his attempt to sketch the creature. The next day, you launch a search for any record of Mr. Landry’s gold mine, starting with prospecting permissions in Anchorage City Hall and the local library. After a day of fruitless research, you still cannot find an official permit or record of a mine connected to Rhett Landry. As you return to the lodge that evening, you spot a tall, willowy figure with a distinctive red cravat standing next to a packed sledge.\n"
"“Well met,” the figure greets you with a self-satisfied smile. “You must be the troublemakers everyone is talking about. Pleased to make your acquaintance. I’m Thorne.” They extend a confident hand to shake yours. “If you’re here, I can only assume it is for the same reason as I. Keep a weather eye out: it’s supposed to be quite cold near Fairbanks! May the best one win.” Thorne winks at you, then mounts the sled.\n"
"You wonder if Thorne’s reference to Fairbanks was clever misdirection or a friendly hint. After asking around the lodge, an attendant opens up about your rival’s preparations: “I was confused at first, until it became clear they were asking about something in tribal territory. You don’t need a permit to prospect out there.” After some more questioning, you have a good sense of Thorne’s direction and the location of the mine."

"<typewriter>\t探员：</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\t我们近几周在阿拉斯加中心地带失去了数个调查员，极可能是出自结社的手笔。其中一名调查员发现了可能的线索：一个明显具有超次元力量的透镜。附件是探勘者瑞德·兰德里的日志，他正被收容在奥勒冈州的晨边疗养院。</typewriter>\n"

"你花了一整天翻阅日志，大多数都是野生动物的素描跟采矿的注记。但最后一段记载让你心底发寒：\n"
"<blockquote><i>“1923年10月4号：</i>\n"
"<i>今晚我将被诅咒的透镜埋回了我找到它的地方。</i>\n"
"<i>刚找到它时我不敢在日志中做任何记录，但我现在没什么好失去了。我在探勘新矿脉时在岩石中发现了这个透镜。它无法透光而且本身散发著奇异的微光，拿著它让我感到很特别，像是被选中了 一样。我在透镜里看见了不可思议的动植物、人类、建筑，一个截然不同的世界，一个不属于我们的世界。这个世界一定存在，它是我们世界的黑暗倒影：一切被遗忘的事物与记忆的避风港。这个透镜——黑曜透镜，让我看见另一个世界的真相。</i>\n"
"<i>我居然以为可以将它纳为己用，我真是太愚蠢了！我观察那个世界的同时，那个世界也在观察我。我在注视透镜时一定不小心召唤了某种危险、未知的生物过来。越来越多与我同行的探勘者在森林中；同时也在记忆中消失。我的伙伴、我的家、我的一切都被我在黑曜透镜瞥见的怪物吞噬了。而现在我还是能在另一个世界看见牠们。</i>\n"
"<i>在森林里游荡的怪物似乎没有固定的形体，牠的外型一直在改变，同时具有许多不同动物的特征，就像神话中的混种怪物。我试著使用黑曜透镜猎捕牠，但光是看著透镜就让我感到头晕目眩。在探索周边区域后，我想我靠陷阱杀死了一只：一只巨大的狼形生物，牠嚎叫著消散不见。但当我隔天回到营地，营地已经被牠袭击了。我的同伴们消失并从记忆里被抹去。</i>\n"
"<i>有关当局认为我疯了，应该被收治。我唯一的办法就是将透镜放回我找到的地方，希望能弥补这一切。也许一切都会恢复正常。”</i>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"在记录旁有一堆黑色的素描，看起来是匆促间的随笔涂鸦，但在看过兰德里的经历后，你认为这是他尝试要画出那个生物的外 型。隔天你开始调查任何关于兰德里发现的金矿记录，你从安克拉治市政厅发放的许可证跟当地图书馆开始寻找。在一整天徒劳无功的调查后，你依然找不到任何与瑞德·兰德里相关的脉记录。当你晚上回到木屋时，你看见一个高挑的身影站在堆满装备的雪橇旁，他戴著一条显眼的红领巾。\n"
"那人带著自恋的笑容问候你：“你好，你一定是大家在谈论的那个大麻烦。很高兴认识你，我是索恩。”他自信地伸出手与你握手。“既然你在这里，我只能推测我们是为了同样的目标而来。请多加小心天气，费尔班克斯可是很冷的！愿最厉害的人获胜。”说完索恩对你眨了眨眼，然后坐上雪橇离去。\n"
"你思考著索恩提到费尔班克斯是刻意误导还是友善的提醒。你四处询问后，一名接待员提到了你对手做的准备：“一开始我很困惑，直到他们问起部落保留区的事情，在那里探勘不需要许可证。”你又追问了一些细节，现在你对于索恩的去向跟矿脉的位置多了一些把握。"

"Before you head out, you ask for directions from a local member of the tribe that owns the territory where you think the mine could be. They are wary of more meddling from outsiders and also concerned for your safety, given the recent trouble with prospectors on their land. You explain you aren’t interested in gold, and are researching the strange case of Mr. Landry. For good measure, you show them the prospector’s journal and the strange etching inside. This seems to buy you some trust, and the tribe member offers some directions.\n"

In my experience, such competence is beyond the Foundation. Now, I believe we have a bit of business to discuss. Please, have a seat.” Thorne says, snapping their fingers. Several Coterie members bring you to a covered awning with a fire and some chairs. Once seated, Thorne clears their throat. “Now then. We both know you have something I want. Something worth untold fortunes. Though I highly doubt you are interested in money. But what if I told you about a greater threat?” Their tone is joking, but their expression is grave. You ask them to explain. “Surely you realize it: I am not the threat here. There is something terrible that stalks these woods. The ultimate predator. As soon as you laid hands on the Sable Glass, your lives were forfeit. It will hunt you down and consume every part of you until there is nothing left, as it has done to many others.” You nod along, considering Thorne’s words. “Luckily for you, this creature is an old enemy of mine. I am uniquely suited to track its movements and lure it out.” Thorne leans forward intently. “For my services, all I ask is the Sable Glass. Believe me, you want someone that knows how to properly operate the thing, anyway.” Thorne offers their gloved hand to shake once again. “So tell me. Do we have a deal?”"

msgid "“Oh goodness gracious,” Thorne says, emerging from the mine. “Put that down at once, you oaf! This is no way to treat guests,” they snap at the guards, who lower their weapons. “You’re too late, I’m afraid. Or rather, just in time, I suppose, depending on your perspective.” Thorne brandishes an obsidian lens in one hand as they smirk. Remembering the Foundation dossier, you ask Thorne if there is anything you can do to negotiate for the Key. They shake their head. “I’m afraid not, kitten. A Key in hand is worth, well, fortunes. Not that I would sell it for anything in the world.” They clutch the Sable Glass in one hand as a chill wind blows. “However, there’s still time to make a deal. If you weren’t completely daft, you’d have noticed this entire area is in grave danger. Something truly terrible stalks these woods. The ultimate predator. In fact, it already knows we’re here.” Thorne looks to you. “The way I see it, you can pout about not getting your prize, or you can help me track my quarry. Do that and I’ll owe you a favor, to be paid at a later date. Do we have a deal?”"
msgstr "“老天啊，”索恩边说边从矿坑中走出来，“你们这些笨蛋，快把枪放下，这可不是待客之道。”他对两个守卫弹了手指，他们将枪放下。“你晚来一步了，或是来的正好，取决你从哪个角度来看。”索恩微笑著晃了晃手中黑曜石制的透镜。你想起基石的档案，开口询问有没有协商密钥归属的可能性。索恩挥挥手：“恐怕不行，小可爱。密钥是无价之宝，我不会为了任何东西放弃。”寒风吹过，他手中紧抓著黑曜透镜。“不过，我们还是可以做个交易。你如果不是笨蛋的话，就会察觉到这个地区笼罩在巨大的危险中。有某种可怕的东西在森林里游荡，最终极的猎杀者。事实上，牠已经知道我们在这了。”索恩看著你，“依我看来，你可以在这里自怨自艾，也可以帮我追踪我的猎物。帮我的话我就欠你个人情，等待日后回报。我们达成共识了吗？”"

If nothing else, you know how to hold your own in a fight. Though I would recommend you reconsider your stance on my fellow Coterie brethren and myself. I do not believe I am the only member of the Coterie who is willing to put aside petty differences in the face of such—” they pause, and in that moment, you sense Thorne’s age and gravity. “Such a monumental crisis.” With that, Thorne smiles and swiftly turns on their heel. “Pleasure doing business with you.
