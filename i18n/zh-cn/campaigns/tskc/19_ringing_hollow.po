"You arrive in Sydney and immediately search for the agent described in Taylor’s dossier, finding her safehouse in an old, condemned warehouse by Botany Bay, on the eastern side of the city. She has an entire wall of filing cabinets containing years and years of research, and her table is covered in a mess of maps and photographs. “Ah, the new cell,” she regards you, flipping on a fluorescent light that coldly illuminates the room. “The name’s Quinn. The commissioner told me you might drop by.”\n"
"You ask her what kind of intel she might have to aid your investigation, which earns you a chuckle. “What don’t I have? Well, let me show you what I am looking into right now…”"

"抵达雪梨后你立刻动身寻找卷宗中提到的那位探员。你在城市东边，植物学湾旁的一座老旧废弃的仓库找到她的藏身处。墙壁旁放满了一柜又一柜的档案，里面放著无数年积累的研究报告，她的桌上杂乱无章的摆著各种地图跟照片。“啊，新探员来了。”她打量著你，打开一盏冷光灯照亮房间。“我是奎茵，调查官告诉我你可能会来。”\n"
"你询问她有没有能帮助你调查的情报，结果她笑了一声说：“有什么是我没有的吗？让我给你看看我正在调查什么……”"

"“I have been looking into the disappearances you mentioned to Taylor. She is concerned about these events, but perhaps not as much as she should be.” She hands you a file from her table and leans back as you examine it. It’s a host of information regarding missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. “Sound familiar?”\n"
"You nod and inform Quinn this is precisely the kind of thing that you’d been looking into before you were recruited to the Foundation. You take the time to tell Quinn everything you know regarding the strange entities you have spotted numerous times in your travels, and what their presence does to objects and people alike.\n"
"“That lines up with my research,” she says, motioning to her cluttered table. “But if that’s true, these things have been active for literally hundreds—thousands of years. And we have collectively forgotten everything that has been erased, save for a desperate few that cling to memory. Do you understand what this means?”\n"
"Other than the obvious—that humanity is in very real danger of becoming forgotten history—you aren’t sure what she is getting at.\n"
"“I have a hunch, but I cannot look into it here. Looks like I’m headed back to Britain. I know you have your own assignment to get to, but, if you can spare the time, can you come meet me in Amesbury? It is just due west of London.” Wearing a taut but determined grimace, Quinn gathers some personal belongings and leaves you with more questions than answers."

"“我正在调查你向泰勒提过的消失事件。她对这些事件有所关注，但我认为她关注的程度还不够。”她交给你一个档案夹后靠回椅背上。里面记录著许多建筑、地方，甚至整个村庄都神秘且无法解释的消失了。“听起来很耳熟吧。”她说。\n"
"你点头并告诉她这就是你被基石征召前在调查的事件。你花了点时间告诉她旅程中与那个奇怪存在数次遭遇的状况，还有牠们能对物件或人造成什么影响。\n"
"她边在杂乱的桌上翻找边说：“这就是我的研究缺失的最后一片拼图。但如果这是真的话，代表牠们已经存在了千百年之久了。而除了少数人之外，人类集体遗忘了那些被抹除的人事物，你了解这代表著什么吗？”\n"
"除了最明显的影响：人类将不再记得自己的过去。你不是很确定她意指的是什么。\n"
"“我有个直觉，但我无法在这里证实，看来我得回英国一趟。我知道你有其他任务，但如果你能腾出时间，到埃姆斯伯里跟我碰面，就在伦敦的西边。”奎茵带著兴奋但充满决心的笑容收拾一些个人物品后就离开了。你感觉自己比抵达这前多了更多疑问。"

"“This is off-book, but I’ve been looking into some pretty strange events. Take a look.” She hands you a file from her table and leans back as you examine it. It’s a host of information regarding missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. You do your best not to let your familiarity with such events show on your face. “Any of this mean anything to you?”\n"
"You don’t like lying, but telling the truth now would reveal your earlier deception to Taylor. You shake your head, telling Quinn this is new to you. “That checks out. See, that is what’s so hinky about all this. You are holding the only surviving records of any of these places. It is as though all of them were completely eradicated from history. And if that is true, who is to say the same could not happen to us?” She shudders. “The thought of being forgotten like that… even by those closest to me… it is my worst fear.”\n"
"You tell Quinn that you feel similarly, and that you wish you had more intel to give her. Her gaze, narrow with suspicion, sees right through you.\n"
"“I do not buy that for a second. Taylor might trust you, or maybe she just does not want to get her hands dirty. But I can tell when someone is lying to my face.” A grim silence hangs in the air. Finally, she exhales. “Fine. Do as you will. But if you decide to spill, you can find me in Amesbury, due west of London,” she says, packing some of her files and personal belongings in a small canvas duffel bag. You repeat her destination, curious as to why.\n"
"“Something there I want to look into,” is all she gives you. You suppose it is only fair, considering your hesitance to give her the full story. She gives you no more than a cold glance as she leaves, and you wonder if perhaps you should have warned her. But what she doesn’t know can’t hurt her… right?"

"“这不在正式纪录中，但我正在调查一些奇怪现象，看看吧。”她交给你一个档案夹后靠回椅背上。里面记录著许多建筑、地方，甚至整个村庄都神秘且无法解释的消失了。你边看边尽力掩饰熟悉的反应。“这些事件对你有特别意义吗？”她问道。\n"
"你不喜欢说谎，但现在说出实话就等于承认你先前欺骗了泰勒。你摇头，告诉奎茵你是第一次看到这些事件。“我想也是。这一切都非常离奇，你手上拿的是这些地方唯一剩下的相关记录，就像它们完全从历史中被抹除了一样。如果这一切都是真的，谁知道同样的事会不会发生在我们身上？”她打了个冷颤，“光是想到连那些我最亲近的人都会将我遗忘……，这是我最大的恐惧。”\n"
"你说自己也有同感，告诉她你多希望自己能提供更多情报。她怀疑地凝视著你，彷佛要将你看穿。\n"
"“我完全不相信你的话。也许泰勒相信了，又或许她只是不想拆穿你。但当有人在我面前撒谎，我能分辨出来。”经过一阵令人不适的沉默后她终于再度开口：“算了，随便你吧。但如果你打算坦白一点，你可以在埃姆斯伯里找到我，就在伦敦的西边。”她边说边将一些档案跟私人物品放进帆布旅行袋中，你重复她的目的地，好奇地询问原因。\n"
"她只说了一句：“我要到那里确认一些事。”由于你没告知她真相，你觉得她的反应很公平。她离开前没说任何话，只是冷冷地看了你一眼。你思考著自己是否该警告她，但如果她不知道，就不需要担心……对吧？"

"You arrive in Sydney and immediately search for the agent described in Taylor’s dossier, but everywhere you search, there appears to be no trace of her, nor any memory of her among the locals. Feeling worried, you redouble your efforts and eventually track her to an old, condemned warehouse by the bay on the eastern side of the city. Inside is an entire wall of filing cabinets containing years and years of research, and a table covered in a mess of maps and photographs. But there is no sign of Agent Quinn.\n"
"Judging from her recent notes, she appeared to have been researching the same kind of paranormal events you’d been looking into before you were recruited to the Foundation—missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. But if she came to any conclusions, you find no evidence of it.\n"
"With no other leads, you depart, filing a report on Quinn’s disappearance for the commissioner. You hope she is simply in hiding somewhere, but your instincts tell you otherwise."

"抵达雪梨后你立刻动身寻找卷宗中提到的那位探员。但不管你如何搜寻都无法找到她的踪迹，当地人对她也完全没有记忆。你有不祥的预感，加强了搜寻的行动，最后你追踪到在城市东边海湾旁的一座老旧废弃的仓库。里面的墙壁旁放满了一柜又一柜的档案，里面放著无数年积累的研究报告，办公桌上杂乱无章的摆著各种地图跟照片。但完全没有奎茵探员的踪影。\n"
"根据她最近的笔记，她研究的正是你被基石征召前在调查的消失事件。许多建筑、地方，甚至整个村庄都神秘且无法解释的消失了。但你找不到任何她是否有得出结论的证据。\n"
"由于没有其他线索可循，你只好离开，并向调查官报告奎茵失踪的事。你希望她只是躲藏起来了，但直觉告诉你并不是这样。"
