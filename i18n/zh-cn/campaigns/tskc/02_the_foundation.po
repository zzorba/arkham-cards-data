"“Talk,” the woman commands.\n"
"“I’m a detective with the ICPC,” Flint barks back. “Flint, Li Flint. And you’re going to be in a lot of trouble when they hear about this.”\n"
"“I assure you, I will not. And you?” she asks, glaring in your direction. You explain that you are independent investigators working with Flint. She takes a moment to read your gaze—presumably to tell if you are lying. She, like Flint, seems low on trust. Finally, after a long, bated moment, she holsters her firearm. Flint’s hands drop to his sides. You let out a breath you didn’t know you were holding.\n"
"“We have been after that red-gloved man for quite some time. This is the first time we have gotten this close. He seems to have a knack for slipping away.” She nods to the two suits flanking her—a tall, athletic, pale-skinned woman and a sharp, clean-shaven man—and motions toward the walls. They keep a hand on their holsters as they scour the perimeter of the room.“And who is ‘we,’ exactly?” Inspector Flint asks. You’ve been wondering the very same thing. Your interrogator has a British accent, but she doesn’t seem to be part of any local outfit you’ve ever heard of.\n"
"She waits for confirmation from her two subordinates before continuing. “All clear, ma’am,” the man states. She sighs and crosses her arms. “All right. What I am about to tell you cannot leave this room under any circumstances. Am I clear?”\n"
"Flint shrugs. “Under penalty of what, exactly?”\n"
"“Summary execution,” she states without hesitation. Your throat closes tight. Even your partner flinches for a moment.\n"
"“Well then. I suppose we don’t have much of a choice, do we?” He glances at you. You nod; you might as well hear what she has to say.\n"
"“I am Commissioner Taylor, and these are agents Hudson and Antonova. We are with the <minicaps>Foundation</minicaps>, an international agency devoted to the discovery, research, and containment of objects with paradimensional capability.”\n"
"“What kind of baloney?” Flint practically laughs. But the woman who calls herself Taylor shows no sign of humor.\n"
"“After the Great War, many treaties and accords were signed. Paris. Versailles. But keeping the peace wasn’t the only goal. There were… oddities, you see. During the war. Things that did not add up. The Foundation’s purpose is to find these ‘things that do not add up’ and ensure that they cannot be used for such purposes ever again.”\n"
"“Well, this is a hell of a con you buttons have cooked up,” Flint says, but the darker tone in his voice indicates he doesn’t even believe himself. And you’re inclined to agree—the fact that Commissioner Taylor even knows of the Red-Gloved Man at all is proof that she has inside knowledge.\n"
"You decide that it’s more likely she is telling the truth than lying, and ask what she intends to do with you.\n"
"She paces in uncomfortable silence before finally letting out a sigh. “Well, I certainly can’t have your investigation running parallel to my own. And you might have information that could be pertinent to our work. So I say we work together.”\n"
"“Work together? Or work for you?” Flint asks pointedly, his eyes narrowing.\n"
"She allows herself a smile. “You are a clever man, I’ll give you that.” She nods to Agent Hudson, who produces several badges and hands them to you. “You’ll be your own cell of the Foundation, operating under our authority, but with independence. All you need to do is agree to report your findings to us.” She locks eyes with Flint appraisingly. “You’ll be our point of contact.”\n"
"You ask Taylor what you get out of the arrangement, besides the lifted threat on your lives. “We’ll hand over the intel we have on the organization the Red-Gloved Man works for and provide travel papers that can get you anywhere in the world, no questions asked, at no expense.”\n"
"Flint eyes the badge like one might an explosive, turning it over and over in his hands. “Two minutes ago you were pointing a gun at me, now you’re offering me a job?”\n"
"“Yes. Well? Are you in?”\n"
"You pull Flint aside to speak with him in private. The discussion is short and hushed, full of conjecture and paranoid theories about this “Foundation” and their true motives. But in the end, you decide to accept her offer. If it will help you get to the bottom of whatever is going on, it is the only real choice.\n"
"“Very well then,” Taylor explains. “The Red-Gloved Man is just one operative of his organization. Or, perhaps, its leader—that we are unable to determine. They call themselves the <minicaps>Red Coterie</minicaps>, so named due to the red garments they wear. They are after artifacts scattered across the world which possess paradimensional capabilities—the very same kind of objects we seek to find and contain. We call them Keys.”\n"
"You ask Commissioner Taylor what she means by the term paradimensional. “Imagine a cake with many layers,” she explains. “Everything we see and feel exists on one layer. But there are many more layers above and below ours. Something that is paradimensional exists on one layer, but draws energy from other, parallel layers. As a result, these Keys operate outside the laws of our dimension. Cause and effect. If left unchecked, they can be used to inflict terrible harm on the world. Our job—your new job—is to get them out of the hands of the Coterie and keep them secure in Foundation custody.”\n"
"If these Keys are as powerful as the Foundation believes, you agree that they should be kept in safe hands. But you cannot help but wonder what this has to do with the disappearances you’ve been investigating, if anything. Flint locks eyes with you and gives you the slightest shake of his head. He has no intention of telling them."

"“快说。”她命令你们。\n"
"“我是ICPC警探！”弗林特吼回去。“弗林特，李·弗林特。如果他们知道，妳就麻烦大了。”\n"
"“我跟你保证，我不会有麻烦的。那你呢？”她转向你问道。你告诉她你是跟弗林特合作的独立调查员。她看著你的眼睛——似乎在判断你有没有说谎。看来她跟弗林特一样，不轻易信任他人。终于，在一段紧绷的时间后，她收回了武器。弗林特放下双手，而你终于把偋住的一口气吐了出来。\n"
"“我们追查那个红手套的人很久了，这是我们第一次这么接近。他似乎对逃走很有一套。”她对两旁的人点点头——一名高挑匀称的白人女性，跟一名敏锐、没蓄胡的男性。他们依然将手握在枪上，开始四处搜寻并确保房间的安全。弗林特警探开口问：你说的‘我们’是谁？”你也在疑惑同样的问题，你们的审问者有英国腔，但看起来却不像任何你所知的在地组织。\n"
"“都安全了，女士。”等到她的两名同伴确认周边安全后她才再度开口。她抱著胸叹了口气：“好吧，我接下来说的事情必须保密，懂了吗？”\n"
"弗林特耸耸肩问到：“不然怎样？”\n"
"“处决。”她毫不犹豫的说。你感觉喉咙缩了一下，就连弗林特都有瞬间畏缩了。\n"
"弗林特看了你一眼：“看来我们没什么选择了对吧？”你点头同意，你也想知道她会说什么。\n"
"“我是调查官泰勒，这是韩德森探员跟安东诺娃探员。我们是<b>基石</b>的一员。我们的组织致力于发现、研究跟控管世界各地拥有超次元力量的物品。”\n"
"“是在扯哪一种蛋？”弗林特几乎笑出来。但那个自称泰勒的女人完全不觉得有趣。\n"
"“在战争结束后，签署了很多和约跟协定，巴黎和约、凡尔赛条约。但维持和平不是唯一的目的。有许多……如你所见，奇怪的事情发生。战争中有很多奇异事件无法解释。基石的目的就是调查这些无法解释的事件，并确保它们不会再度发生。\n"
"“好吧，这一切听起来像是你们脑袋坏掉了。”弗林特回答。但他的声音中沮丧的语调透露出他自己都不相信自己。你也倾向同意——调查官泰勒认识红手套，代表她知道的比你们更多。\n"
"你认为她说的的应该是实话，并询问她对你们有什么打算。\n"
"她踱著步，经过一段令人不适的沉默后，她开口：“我不能让你们的调查干扰到我。而且你们也许有对我们有帮助的资讯。所以我建议我们一起行动。”\n"
"弗林特瞇著眼尖锐的问道：“一起行动?还是为妳做事?”\n"
"她露出一丝微笑，“我得承认你是个聪明人。”她示意韩德森探员，韩德森交给你们两个徽章。她边打量著弗林特边说：“用这个可以跟基石联络，你们可以独立行动，但要在我们的监管下。你们只要同意将得到的情报跟我们报告。你们会成为我们的联络人。”\n"
"你问泰勒你们能得到什么援助，除了威胁以外。“我们会提供关于红手套组织的情报，还有让你们能前往世界各地的证件文书，不问原因、无须代价。”\n"
"弗林特用看炸弹的眼神盯著徽章，将它在手里翻来覆去。“两分钟前你才拿枪指著我，现在却要我帮你工作？”\n"
"“是，没错。所以？你要加入吗？”\n"
"你将弗林特拉到一边。经过一番短暂但激烈的讨论，你们质疑“基石”这个组织的真实性跟动机，但最后你们还是决定接受她的要求。如果这能带领你们找到真相，那你们也别无选择。\n"
"“非常好。”泰勒接著解释道：“红手套只是他的组织中其中一名成员，也许可能是领袖，我们并不确定。他们自称<b>绯红结社</b>，源于他们穿的红色服饰。他们的目标是散落在世界各地具有超次元力量的物品，像是我们找寻并控管的那些。我们称这些物品为密钥。”\n"
"你问调查官泰勒超次元是什么意思。她解释道：“想像一个很多层的蛋糕。我们能看到跟感受到在其中一层的东西，但在我们之上与之下还有许多层次。具有超次元力量的物品可以从其他平行层汲取力量，也就是说这些密钥在启动并造成影响时，无须遵从我们这个次元的法则。如果放任不管，它们可能会被用来对这个世界造成巨大的伤害。我们的工作——你们的新工作，是将它们置于基石安全的保管之下，免于落入结社的手中。”\n"
"如果这些密钥如同基石所说的一样危险，那必须让它们保管在对的人手上。但你不禁想知道这跟你在调查的失踪事件有什么关联。弗林特盯著你并微微地挥了挥手，看来他不希望告知他们这件事。"

"You decide it’s best to tell Commissioner Taylor why you were looking into the Red-Gloved Man to begin with. Flint lets out an audible sigh. She mulls it over for a few moments, then shakes her head. “That is something to look into, but your primary objective is to acquire the Keys the Coterie is searching for, at all costs. Am I understood?” Taylor further explains that she will forward any relevant information to Flint’s office, with some “sensitive details” omitted, of course. She will also provide the ICPC with the requisite papers regarding Flint’s new “position.”\n"
"“Oh, and Agent Flint,” she says on her way out, addressing him by his new title. “Your cell may have the independence to act on their own accord, but do not forget that you report directly to me. I expect you to do so without reservation should you discover anything of import.”\n"
"He nods, only the slightest hint of resistance giving him away."

"你觉得最好告诉调查官泰勒你一开始会来追查红手套的原因。弗林特明显的叹了口气。她仔细思考了一下后摇了摇头。“这的确需要深入调查。但你们目前的首要目标是不计代价阻止结社拿到密钥，清楚了吗？”接著泰勒说她会告知国际刑警协会相关的资讯，当然会省略一些“敏感的细节”。她也会准备好要将弗林特转调到“新单位”的文件给ICPC。\n"
"“喔对了，弗林特探员，”她用弗林特的新职位称呼他。“你也许被准许独立行动，但别忘了你必须直接向我报告。我希望如果你发现了什么重要的事，不要知而不报。”\n"

"The next morning, your “cell” meets at the tea room near Trafalgar Square where you had originally intended to meet the previous night. Together, you go over the documentation provided to Flint by this “Foundation.”\n"
"“It’s all a bit difficult to believe, if I’m being honest,” Flint says, “but everything checks out. The travel papers, the job transfer, all of it. Not even my boss questioned it for a moment. I guess we’re secret agents now, eh?”\n"
"You agree; unbelievable as it might seem, it’s no less strange than the matters you had already been looking into. “Right. Well, I think the best thing to do is to split up. Shanghai is where I grew up. I have connections there I can leverage. So I’ll head there first. Where you want to investigate next is up to you. Meet up with me later, and we can figure out where to go from there.”"

"你表示同意，虽然看起来很神奇，但跟你们调查的事件相比也没这么难以理解。“看来我们最好分头进行，我要先去上海，我在那里长大，有可用的线人。你可以自行决定要去哪里。我们之后再会合，看下一步该怎么做。”"

Each space on the map is connected to one or more other spaces by paths. When you are ready to embark, travel along the paths to reach whichever destination you wish (as a group). For each path you use to reach your destination, you must mark 1 <b>time</b> in your Campaign Log (to a minimum of 1).\n"
"At each space on the map, there is a number and letter combination that will guide you to a particular page in this Campaign Guide. You do not have to stop at every space you travel through; however, if you wish to stop traveling and see what is at that space, turn to the page of the Campaign Guide that matches the indicated number and follow the story text there. This might lead you to an interlude or to a scenario. There is no perfect path to follow, so follow your gut… just be wary of how much time you spend (see “Tracking Time” in Campaign Setup).\n"

She first marks 1 <b>time</b> to use the path to Rome, but chooses not to stop there, and marks 1 more <b>time</b> to travel to Marrakesh, where she stops.
