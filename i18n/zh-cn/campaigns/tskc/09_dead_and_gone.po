msgid "You arrive in London and follow Agent Quinn’s directions to get to the town of Amesbury. Immediately after checking into a hotel, your concierge wordlessly hands you a note with an address by the side of a park on the western side of the historic town. You head there immediately, only to find Agent Ari Quinn sitting in the driver’s seat of a Bentley, reading a newspaper and not paying you any heed. Without making a scene, you silently climb into the passenger seat. “Finally. Been waiting here all day.” You’re not even sure how Quinn knew you’d arrived in town, but you suppose the Foundation must have eyes and ears all over every harbor and border checkpoint. You ask her what she’s been up to, and what she wanted to show you, at which point she starts the Bentley’s engine and rolls along the road to the west. “You’ll see.” Just a short drive later, you come to a familiar sight. You should have known—Quinn has taken you to the site of mysterious and prehistoric Stonehenge. A ring of standing stones marks the site, inside which another ring of smaller bluestones seem to serve no particular purpose whatsoever. A few tourists peruse the monument in awe, but it is otherwise quiet. You follow close behind and ask Agent Quinn why she asked you to come all this way. “Strange place, is it not?” she asks. A rhetorical question—historians have long debated over the likely function of the landmark, but none know for certain. As you draw nearer, she points to the various standing stones and to the concentric ring of smaller stones inside. “Almost seems like something is missing.”"
msgstr "你抵达伦敦后依循奎茵探员给的方向前往埃姆斯伯里。你在旅馆登记入住时，柜台人员不发一语的塞给你一张纸条，上面是位于这个小镇西边的一座公园的地址。你立即前往那里，看见艾里·奎茵探员坐在一辆宾利的驾驶座上，她看著报纸，没对你做任何暗示。你没有试著引起她注意，只是静静的坐进副驾驶座。“终于来了，我已经等了一整天了。”你不确定她是怎么知道你已经抵达小镇的，但你猜也许基石在每个港口跟边境检查哨都有耳目吧。你问她在计划什么，还有她想给你看些什么。她只是发动引擎并开上往西的道路。“你待会就知道了。”开了一小段路程后，你们到了一个熟悉的地点，你早该猜到的，奎茵带你来到了神秘的史前巨石阵。矗立的巨石形成一个圆环，其中还有一个由蓝石围起的小环，不知是否有什么特殊意义。除了观光客偶尔发出的赞叹声，这里非常安静。你跟在奎茵探员身后并问她为什么要大老远来到这。“奇怪的地方，不是吗?”她只是问了个不言而喻的问题。历史学家们对于这个地标的功能有著漫长的辩论，但没有人能肯定。当你们走近，她指著几个矗立的巨石跟内部较小的圆环说：“看起来就像少了什么东西。”"

msgid "Quinn’s demeanor changes when she sees the look on your face. “Well, that triggered something. Still going to play it tight-lipped?” She heads to the center of the bluestone ring and takes out a small contraption possessing a series of lights along its surface. It lets out several beeps, rising in frequency as she reaches the very center. “Yeah, that just about confirms my suspicions… but I’m still missing the why. So, enlighten me, since you seem to know more than I do: what the hell could have made part of a structure vanish not just from existence, but from recorded history as well?”"
msgstr "奎茵看到你脸上的表情后终于打破冷漠：“看来你终于有反应了，还坚持要守口如瓶吗？”她拿出一个上面有许多灯光警示的奇怪装置，然后走向蓝石圈的中心。装置在她手中发出声响，警示声的频率随著她靠近中心而逐渐升高。“没错，这证实了我的猜测……但我还是不知道原因。很明显你知道得比我多，告诉我：到底是什么原因能让整个结构消失，还同时从历史纪录中被抹除？。”"

msgid "<i>Keep your secrets.</i>"
msgstr "<i>保守秘密。</i>"

msgid "You tell Quinn everything—about the entities you were investigating in London, about their presumed connection to the Red Coterie, all of it. She listens intently, hanging on every word. “So these things, these… let us presume to call them ‘extraterrestrials,’ when they take something, it vanishes completely. Do you understand what this means?” You know a great many conclusions that could be drawn from these events, but you encourage her to continue on her own. “Everything we know, everything we can see, it’s just what’s left. Look at Stonehenge. We have no earthly clue what it is. Maybe that’s because it’s incomplete. There could have been dozens of other structures erected right where we stand and humanity would never know.” She paces back and forth, agitated. “This is my life’s work. I’ve studied these kinds of events for over a decade. Paranormal disappearances. Dead civilizations. Bloody hell, I’m fluent in a dozen dead languages. I’ve always assumed these events are a small slice of pie missing from the greater whole. But what if we’re only seeing what’s left—the tiny slice of pie these creatures haven’t stolen?”"
msgstr "你对奎茵全盘托出，关于你在伦敦调查的奇异存在，还有牠们与绯红结社可能的关联性。她仔细听著，思考著每一个描述。“所以这些东西……我们先姑且称牠‘外星生物’，当牠们带走某个东西时，会让它完全消失。你知道这代表了什么吗？”你听过许多关于这些事件的猜测，但你鼓励她说出自己的结论。“我们已知的所有事物，所有我们能见的东西，都只是牠们留下的一部分。看看巨石阵，我们不知道它的用途，也许是因为它根本不完整。可能有许多其他建物就曾经矗立在我们脚下，但我们却永远不会知道。”她焦虑的踱步著：“这是我一生的研究，我已经在这些事件上下了超过十年的心血了。离奇的失踪、灭亡的文明，该死的，我甚至会说十几种绝迹的语言。我一直以为这些事件是大拼图中的一小片缺少的部分；但如果其实我们所知的只是一小片还没被那些生物偷走的部分呢？”"

msgid "Quinn sighs and turns away from you. “Sorry to have wasted your time, then. You can take the Bentley back to London. It’s only a couple miles back to Amesbury. I’ll find another ride.” You try to reason with her, but she remains stoic. “If you have nothing to tell me, I have nothing to say to you, either. Please leave me be so I can continue my research in peace.”"
msgstr "奎茵叹气并转身背对你。“很抱歉浪费你的时间。你可以把车开回伦敦，埃姆斯伯里不远，我可以另找方式回去。”你试著跟她解释，但她只是冷漠的回答：“如果你不愿意坦诚，那我跟你也没什么好谈的。请离开让我专心进行研究。”"

msgstr "持续隐瞒基石。"

msgid "Quinn heads to the center of the bluestone ring and takes out a small contraption possessing a series of lights along its surface. It lets out several beeps, rising in frequency as she reaches the very center. “This confirms my suspicions,” she says under her breath, then shows her readings to you. “Found these same kind of readings in a lot of other places. Roanoke Island. Angkor. You get the idea.” She stands and taps the device against the palm of her hand as she scans the stone rings. “These things you mentioned in your report, these—let us presume to call them ‘extraterrestrials’—when they take something, it vanishes completely. Do you understand what this means? Everything we know, everything we can see, it’s just what’s left. Look at Stonehenge. We have no earthly clue what it is. Maybe that’s because it’s incomplete.

msgid "Suddenly, what Agent Quinn just said snaps you to attention. Quinn is an expert in long-dead languages and ancient civilizations. You ask her if she’d be willing to help you with a related matter far from Amesbury. “If it will help me get to the bottom of this, then yes,” she replies eagerly. “What can I do for you?” With bated breath, you tell her it might require her to not inform the Foundation of her next whereabouts. She takes a moment to consider the implications, then nods, resolute. You hand her the whistle Aliki gave to you and tell her that it belonged to a Coterie member who seemed to know only Latin, ancient Greek, and other languages you could not decipher. She studies it for a long while, turning it over and over in her hand. “A white raven,” she murmurs to herself. “The Greek myths tell us that ravens were the messengers of the Gods; Apollo in particular. They were once all white, but when Apollo sent one to spy on his lover, Coronis, he learned of his lover’s infidelity and scorched the raven’s wings black in anger.” You ask Agent Quinn if there is any place in the world one might associate with Apollo or his raven. “There are temples in Rome dedicated to the god Apollo,” she says. “Apollo Sosianus and Apollo Palatinus. Let me know if you head there. I’ll meet you.”"
msgstr "奎茵探员提到的某件事突然引起了你的注意，她是一个绝迹语言跟远古文明的专家。你问她是否愿意离开埃姆斯伯里，帮助你处理一个问题。她急切地回答：“如果能帮助我了解这一切的真相，我就愿意。我可以帮你什么忙？”你很高兴，但还是先警告她，如果她想要帮忙，就必须向基石隐瞒这件事。她思考了一下这背后代表的意义后，坚决的点头同意了。你把阿利琪给你的哨子放到她手中，告诉她这是属于一名结社成员的东西，她似乎只会说拉丁语、古希腊语跟其他你无法辨识的语言。奎茵将哨子翻来覆去，仔细地研究它。她喃喃自语著：“白色渡鸦。希腊神话中说渡鸦曾是神的信使，尤其是阿波罗的。牠们曾经是白色的，但阿波罗派了其中一只去监视祂的爱人——柯洛妮丝，而当渡鸦回报她的不忠时，阿波罗在盛怒之下将牠烧成了黑色。”你询问奎茵世界上哪个地方也许会跟阿波萝或祂的渡鸦有关联。她说：“在罗马有供奉阿波罗的神殿，阿波罗索西乌斯神庙跟巴拉丁诺山阿波罗神庙。你要前往之前通知我，我会在那里跟你碰面。”"
