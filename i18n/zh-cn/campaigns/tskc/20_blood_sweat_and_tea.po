"On the train into Hong Kong, Agent Flint shares his current lead with you. “Tzu San Niang is due to meet with her new business partners this afternoon at a local teahouse. From what I gather, they’re a real rogue’s gallery of scumbags. The type that makes their fortunes by exploiting their workers to death. She’s so drawn to these types, it gives me a theory. She’s not just taking these jobs because they pay well. Time and again she goes for these deals where she can help the British at the expense of the common folk. It’s like she’s… attracted to the suffering she causes. Maybe worse.”\n"
"Before you can discuss this theory in more depth, your train arrives at its stop. You and Flint hurry onto the platform and rush to the teahouse, but you arrive too late: a telltale red parasol is sifting through the street crowd, heading swiftly away. You follow the parasol with your eyes as its bearer steps into a nearby alleyway. Flint whispers to you to stay, but you can’t while your quarry is so close.\n"
"The moment you enter the alleyway, Tzu San Niang turns and looks you in the eye. “I am used to attention,” she croons, “but I heard you were a little too interested in me.” She raps the tip of her parasol onto the street, and a burst of silvery energy rushes through the ground, jumping into your body. Your skin goes suddenly numb, and you collapse to the ground. The painful pinprick sensation of a sleeping limb takes over your entire body. Tzu San Niang smiles, puts her parasol over her shoulder, and walks away. She gets a few yards away and, apparently believing she is out of earshot, she tells her entourage: “We are done here. The Foundation is on to us. Eliminate them and move on to the Selangor Club harvest.”\n"
"You hear feet shuffling in your direction, but before any reckoning comes, Flint picks you up and drags you back out to the street, where the crowd and broad daylight might keep you from overt harm… for now. As the sensation in your limbs returns, Flint muses aloud. “The Royal Selangor Club—that’s a social club in Kuala Lumpur. Come on, we have no time to lose.” He helps you to your feet, but you’re still recovering from the blast of energy that sent your body and mind reeling. The parasol isn’t just a Coterie insignia after all—it is a Key!"

"在前往香港的火车上，弗林特探员跟你分享他目前所知的情报。“梓三娘会在下午跟她的生意伙伴在当地的茶室会面。就我搜集到的资讯来看，他们都是一群强盗恶棍，靠著将劳工剥削至死来赚取利润。她似乎特别受这些人吸引，所以我有个假设：她不只是为了高额报酬而已。从她对于帮助英国佬剥削平民的积极程度看来，她似乎……以她造成的苦难为乐，或甚至更糟。”\n"
"在你们有机会深入讨论前”火车到站了。你跟弗林特踏上月台并急忙赶往茶室，但你们还是太迟了。你们在人群中看到一把鲜红的阳伞正在快速远离。你们跟踪她，看见她转进一条小巷。弗林特要求你在这等待，但你不愿意在猎物近在咫尺的状况下袖手旁观。\n"
"你们转进巷子的同时，梓三娘转身与你们四目相对。她用银铃般的声音说：“我很习惯引人瞩目，但你们对我过于有兴趣了。”她将阳伞的尖端往地上拍，一道银色的能量爆出，沿著地面袭向你们。你感到一阵麻木，感觉像千万根针刺在你每一寸皮肤上，你在剧痛中倒在地上。梓三娘笑了，她将阳伞放回肩上，转身离开。她走到认为你们听不见的距离后跟她的随从说：“这里的事结束了，基石盯上我们了，把他们处理掉，然后前往雪兰莪俱乐部进行收割。”\n"
"你听见脚步声向你靠近，但在他们动手前，弗林特扶起你并将你拖到阳光普照的大街上，也许拥挤的人群跟光线能暂时保护你们。等你终于能再度控制自己的身体时，弗林特说：“皇家雪兰莪俱乐部，那是位于吉隆坡的的社交俱乐部。走吧，没时间浪费了。”他扶你起身，你还没完全从那股力量造成的无力及晕眩中恢复过来。鲜红的阳伞不只是结社的身份象征——它是一把密钥！"

"You meet Agent Flint at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical gardens. He shakes your hand and leans in close. “Do you have a tail?” he asks. You assure him you do not. You have been careful.\n"
"He updates you on the case while the two of you stroll through the gardens, looking to all the world like normal tourists. He explains that the lady with the red parasol is using the name Tzu San Niang, and that she has made an international business out of helping the British expand their empire, often using the most brutal methods. Her silver tongue and negotiating skills are apparently the thing of legend: she can convince worker unions to tolerate abysmal conditions, local governments to accept the extraction of natural resources without batting an eye, and worse.\n"
"“We can’t be too careful,” Flint warns. “Obviously, Ms. Tzu is no one to be trifled with, but it’s that parasol that’s the key to her operation, if you’ll pardon my pun. I think it actually is giving her the ability to sway minds.”\n"
"You can’t object—the evidence is piling up. Flint’s initial hunch was right. “What’s worse is that she already suspects we’re on to her. I had a Coterie operative sniffing me out just earlier this week. Luckily, I managed to get the upper hand. Found his safehouse before he found mine. And the best part?” He gives you a sly grin. “He had an itinerary on him. They’re headed to the Royal Selangor Club next. It’s a social club in Kuala Lumpur, for the wealthy elite. Care to join me?”"

"你在香港的动植物公园与弗林特见面。他跟你握手，在你耳边低声问：“你有被跟踪吗？”你向他保证没有，你非常小心。\n"
"你们在公园中漫步，交换著情报，看起来就像普通的游客一样。他说红伞女子使用梓三娘这个名字，她正在帮助一群英国人扩张国际事业的版图，通常借由残酷的手段。她的能言善道跟谈判技巧蔚为传奇。她可以让工会接受最严苛的条件；让政府机关眼睛都不眨一下就同意耗尽天然资源的提案，还有其他更糟的事。\n"
"弗林特警告你：“多小心都不为过，很明显这位梓小姐绝非善类。但她的阳伞才是这一切的钥匙，请原谅我用双关语。我认为就是密钥赋予了她操控心智的能力。”\n"
"你无法反驳，证据摆在眼前，弗林特一开始的直觉是对的。“更糟的是她已经在怀疑我们盯上她了。前几天我发现有一名结社成员在打探我的行踪。幸运的是我占了上风，在他找上我前，我先找到了他的藏身处。你猜最棒的是什么？”他狡诈地笑了一下。“他带著一份旅行计划，他们接下来前往皇家雪兰莪俱乐部，一个在吉隆坡的社交俱乐部，专门为有钱人打造的。你要一起来吗？”"

"You reply to Agent Flint’s telegram, but he never returns your message. You head to Flint’s last known hotel to inquire personally, but they tell you that he never received your telegram. In fact, according to the concierge, he hasn’t been back in several days. You decide that the Coterie must be behind this disappearance, and that the best way of finding Flint is to find the lady with the red parasol.\n"
"For days you search for signs of the Coterie, but find nothing. You establish the trust of some business contacts and begin to ask them about the lady with the red parasol. Most of them pretend to know nothing, but eventually you hear about a railway being constructed in Malaysia. The rail was delayed, but they sent a negotiator in to reach an agreement, saying “no one says no to her.” Maybe Flint simply went to Kuala Lumpur to investigate on his own, but…\n"
"A lump forms in your throat. You suspect the worst."

"你回复弗林特的电报后一直没收到回音，所以你亲自前往弗林特最后提到的旅馆想找到他的行踪。但柜台人员告诉你他没有收到你的电报，事实上，他已经好几天没有回到这里了。你认为结社一定跟他的失踪有关，找到他的最大希望就是先找到那个红伞女子。\n"
"你花了好几天搜寻结社的行踪，却一无所获。但你跟几位当地的生意人搭上线，并询问他们关于红伞女子的事。他们一开始都假装一无所知，但最后你终于问出在马来西亚有一项铁路工程正在延宕之中，他们派了一个谈判专家过去，据说没有人能对她说“不”。也许弗林特只是独自前往了吉隆坡，但是……\n"
"一股不祥的预感涌上心头，你做著最坏的打算。"
