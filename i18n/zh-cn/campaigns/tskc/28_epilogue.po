"“Talk,” Commissioner Taylor commands.\n"
"You shift in your uncomfortable metal chair, the glaring light of her interrogation lamp nearly blinding you. One wall of the sterile interrogation chamber is covered by a black mirror that reflects you and the Commissioner sitting across a desk from one another, your faces blanched under heavy white light. Knowing the Foundation, several operatives are watching and recording your every move from behind the mirror. A thick dossier lies unopened on the desk between you and Taylor."

"“说吧。”调查官泰勒用命令的口吻说。\n"
"你不适地在金属椅中扭动，审讯灯照的你几乎看不见。审讯室其中一面墙上装著黑色的镜子，镜子中是你与调查官隔著桌子相对而坐的倒影，你的脸色在强烈的白光下显得十分苍白。依照基石的惯性，镜子另一边应该有许多人正在看著你们，并记录下你的一字一句。一份盖著的厚重档案放在你跟泰勒之间。"

"Rather than answer directly, you ask instead what Taylor expected when she conscripted a random set of people into a Foundation cell. She looks genuinely caught off-guard as you explain your work and your role in assisting the Red Coterie to suppress what was clearly the greatest threat to humanity. The commissioner’s eye arches as you lean back in your seat in a gesture of casual indifference.\n"
"“I… see,” she visibly suppresses a grimace. You see her gaze linger on your crimson regalia. “You were hired for your curiosity, ingenuity, and independence. A statement which—may I remind you—is not to be taken as any form of compliment or commendation. It was an assumed risk that you might fall in with the Red Coterie, but one which I assured senior command was highly unlikely, if not impossible.”\n"
"A heavy silence falls as the commissioner makes a near-imperceptible nod at the black mirror to her left, then looks back to you.\n"
"“This, then, is no longer a briefing, but a negotiation. Understand that your role at the Foundation is terminated forthwith. All assets and privileges you previously enjoyed are rescinded, along with your prior rank and compensation.” You detect a hint of regret in her voice as she locks eyes with you. “Instead, let us view this as an opportunity. We have been at odds with the Coterie long enough; perhaps it is time that we worked together.”\n"
"Beyond the commissioner’s steely-eyed professionalism, you sense something else in her voice. Is it respect? She gives you an intense look.\n"
"“The Foundation and the Coterie, as partners. What do you say? Are you in?”"

"你没有直接回答问题，而是询问泰勒，她当时招募来历不明的你进入基石时，希望得到什么。显然这个问题让她措手不及。你接著开始解释你是如何与绯红结社合作，以及协助他们对抗也许是人类生存的最大威胁。你说完后不屑的靠回椅背，调查官的眼睛圆睁著。\n"
"“我……懂了。”她很努力压抑著表情，你注意到她的视线落在你身上的一抹红色。“你是因为你的好奇心、跳脱的思维与独立性而被招募的，请容我提醒，以上评价并无赞美的意思。你转而加入绯红结社的风险一直都存在，但我个人认为机率极小，甚至不可能。”\n"
"一段沉重的静默后，调查官几乎无法察觉地转头向黑色镜子点点头，然后转回来看著你。\n"
"“既然如此，那这就不再是场报告了，而是协商。你在基石的任期结束了，所有之前赋予你的资源与特权将被收回，还有你的职位与补偿金。”你从她的语气跟眼神中捕捉到一丝愧疚。“但让我们将此视为一个契机，我们已经与结社争斗太久了，也许是时候让我们握手言和了。”\n"
"在调查官坚定的眼神与公事公办的态度之外，你从她的声音中感觉到其他东西，是尊敬吗？她认真的看著你。\n"
"“基石与结社，携手合作。你怎么说？同意吗？”"

"You find yourself awkwardly repeating events and names as you struggle to relay your experience to the commissioner. Throughout it all, Taylor remains silent, listening to your various rabbit trails and accounts of events with an air of reserve. When you have finished, she slides a glass of water across the desktop toward you. You see your shadowy reflection glimmer within the black mirror in the corner of your eye.\n"
"“What an… unrestrained account,” she says matter-of-factly. A heavy silence falls as the commissioner makes a near-imperceptible nod at the black mirror to her left, then looks back to you.\n"
"“The Foundation thanks you for your service. Understand that everything you have done during your tenure with the Foundation is classified, and you are bound under threat of execution to never share this account with another soul: living or dead.” She locks eyes with you. “Do you understand?”\n"
"You nod, and the commissioner goes on. “It goes without saying, but I must inform you that your temporary ‘cell’ has been disavowed and all assets acquired during your Foundation service will be retained for further study and research. Your account of all events involving paracausal disturbance will be extracted, analyzed, and preserved for future analysis.”"

"你发现自己尴尬的重复著事件跟姓名，试著在隐瞒部分事实的状态下交代来龙去脉。泰勒静静的听著你杂乱无章的故事跟语带保留的陈述。当你说完时，她隔著桌子递给你一杯水，你的余光看见黑色镜面上自己的倒影散发著微光。\n"
"“多么……复杂的陈述。”她仔细斟酌著用词。一段沉重的静默后，调查官几乎无法察觉地转头向黑色镜子点点头，然后转回来看著你。\n"
"“基石感谢你的付出。请注意你在基石服务的这段时间是最高机密，若你泄漏相关的资讯给任何存在，无论有形或无形，都将面临处决的惩罚。”她看著你的眼睛说，“你明白了吗？”\n"
"你点头，调查官继续说道：“虽然是理所当然，但我还是必须通知你，你临时的‘探员’身份将被取消，所有属于基石的资产都将被回收并受到进一步的检视与调查。所有你介入的超自然事件将被记录归档并进行分析，留存以做为未来的情报使用。”"

"Commissioner Taylor produces a black leather briefcase from behind the desk, opens it, and slides a Foundation badge across the table to you. “Bureaucratic flim-flam, of course. Your cell has been dissolved and you have received approval to join the Foundation with full clearance, full stop. Whether or not you wish to join is irrelevant; you have seen and accomplished too much to return to civilian life.”\n"
"The badge gleams in the harsh light as you turn it over in your hand. It has surprising heft. The sudden weight of everything that has happened hits you as your thumb plays over the grooves and ridges of the metal surface. Taylor flips open the dossier on the table and continues.\n"
"“Your date of hire is yesterday. Don’t worry: you will receive backpay as well as a sizeable compensation package for your work on the case. Which—on that—we are considering labeling ‘The Scarlet Keys.’ It has a nice ring to it, though it is a bit extravagant for my taste.”\n"

"调查官泰勒从桌子后拿出一个黑色的手提箱，打开后将一枚基石徽章滑过桌面给你。“一些繁琐的文书工作，你懂的。你的临时身份已经取消，转为正式、永久的职位。你愿不愿意接受无关紧要，你已经知道太多、也贡献太多以致于我们无法让你回归平民身份。”\n"
"你将徽章在手中翻来覆去，它在强烈的光线下闪闪发光，你惊讶著它的重量。你用手指感受金属表面的高低深浅的同时，回想著这段时间的经历与肩负的重任。泰勒翻开桌上的档案继续说。\n"
"“你被雇用的日期是昨天。别担心，你会收到这段期间的完整薪资，还有针对这次事件的巨额补偿。这次事件我们打算称为‘绯红密钥’。虽然我个人觉得有点太夸张了，但听起来的确还不错。”\n"

"Commissioner Taylor opens the dossier in front of her and slides a set of tickets across the table to you.\n"
"“These are one-way tickets that will take you anywhere in the world, no questions asked. Given your troublesome curiosity, I recommend you go somewhere quiet and forgettable, assume an alias, and take up a profession that does not allow you so much free time or thinking. Oh, and stop wearing that,” she says, gesturing off-handedly at your appearance.\n"
"You interrupt and try to explain yourself. The commissioner holds up one hand to silence you.\n"
"“In truth, I must inform you that you are getting off rather easily here. If the higher-ups had their say, you would have been summarily executed for your reckless handling of this case. The word ‘collusion’ was tossed around. Had you toed the line, this case might have made your career. In my estimation, you have created far more trouble than you resolved.”\n"
"Taylor stands up, and you stand with her. Several burly suits step through the door behind you, flooding the room with light. The commissioner gives you a firm handshake, her eyes locked with yours. “The Foundation thanks you for your service. May we never meet again.”"

"“这是前往世界各地的单程票，你可以去任何地方，不会有人拦你。但基于你恼人的好奇心，我建议你去一个安静平和的地方，取个假名，找个不会让你有太多时间胡思乱想的工作。喔，还有，别再穿成这样了。”她边说边比著你全身。\n"
"你打断她想为自己辩护，但调查官举起一只手阻止你。\n"
"“事实上，你该庆幸能这么轻易的离开，如果照上面的意思，你会由于你鲁莽的行动而草草的被处决，‘勾结’这个词在会议中被提起了很多次。如果你更谨慎一些，这本来会是你新职位的完美开始。但依我评估，你解决的问题远不及造成的麻烦多。\n"
"你跟著泰勒一起站起身，镜子另一端的房间在许多模糊身影离开时被点亮。调查官正式的跟你握手，盯著你的双眼说：“基石感谢你的付出。希望我们永远不会再见面。”"
