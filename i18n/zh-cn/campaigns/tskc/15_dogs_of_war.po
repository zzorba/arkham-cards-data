"From the moment you step off the train in Alexandria, your hackles are raised. Dark clouds gather over the city, and waves crash ominously against the Mediterranean coastline. But the brewing storm is not what worries you—it’s your tail.\n"
"It started with just a few of them. Local authorities, you suspect. Or at least, that seems to be their cover. They could be Foundation agents keeping tabs on you to ensure you remain on task, or Coterie operatives looking to take out a potential threat. You navigate your way through the streets toward the Windsor Hotel, where you have a room booked for the night, but everywhere you turn, you spot more of them. You begin to formulate a plan just in case. Perhaps you can confront one by surprise, interrogate them, learn what they are after… but your thoughts are interrupted when a group of them beat you to the punch.\n"
"“Welcome to Alexandria, agents. Yes, we know who you are,” one of them says, but to your surprise, he raises his hands and shows that he bears no weapons. Now that you are closer, you can easily spot the telltale scarlet trappings among their persons—ties, cufflinks, and the like. “Don’t worry, we come in peace. One of our number wishes to speak with you. We have a problem in Alexandria that perhaps you can help us with.”\n"
"You scoff, incredulous at the audacity of such a request. You have no intention of walking into the Beast’s trap. “I understand why you’re wary,” the agent says, “but I think you will find this agreement to your liking. If you come seeking the Beast, believe it or not, our goals are aligned. This invitation comes from one much wiser and far less dangerous, I assure you. Come. We have much to discuss.”\n"
"You consider your options, but trap or no trap, you can’t pass up an opportunity to speak with a high-ranking member of the Coterie. Information is your best weapon right now, and no matter what, this can only help to inform you. You agree to follow, but keep an eye on your escorts, just in case.\n"
"To your surprise, the agents lead you by way of a horse-drawn carriage to the Bourse—the stock exchange building in the heart of the city. You follow your escorts through a bustling crowd wearing the finest clothes, up several flights of stairs, and through a locked office door on the top floor of the exchange. Immediately, you realize this must be no ordinary stock exchange, but a Coterie hideout of some kind. The office on the other side is an enormous suite, adorned with a surprising number of ancient relics and Euro-centric art, including a rather large portrait of a knight wearing a suit of scarlet-plated armor."

"当你在亚历山卓下车的瞬间，你的寒毛都竖了起来。乌云笼罩著城市，来自地中海的波涛不祥地打在海岸线上。但即将来临的风暴不是你感到不安的原因，而是那些跟踪你的人。\n"
"一开始只有寥寥数人，你猜是当地政府的人员，至少他们的伪装看起来是这样。也许是基石派来确保你忠实执行任务的人；又或许是来监视潜在威胁的结社爪牙。你走在街道上，向著你晚上入住的温莎饭店前进，但每次你转头时都看到更多的人在聚集。你开始思考计划，以防万一。也许你可以出奇不意的直面他们，质问他们到底想要什么。但突然一群人挡住你的去路，中断你的思绪。\n"
"“欢迎来到亚历山卓，探员。没错，我们知道你是谁。”其中一人开口说，出乎你意料的是，他举起手向你示意自己没带武器。在这个距离下你清楚看到他们身上的红色配件，领带、袖扣之类的，泄漏了他们的身份。“别紧张，我们没有恶意，我们之中有人想跟你谈谈，你也许可以帮我们解决这里的一些问题。”\n"
"你无法置信他们提出这么直接的要求，你讥讽的说自己可不打算踏入野兽的陷阱。他回答：“我了解你的顾虑，但我保证你会愿意考虑这个交易。如果你是来找野兽的，那我们的目标是一样，信不信由你。这个邀请是来自于一位更有智慧也更不具威胁性的成员，我向你保证。来吧，我们有很多事要讨论。”\n"
"你考虑了一下，不管是不是陷阱，你都不能错过一个跟结社高层会面的机会。情报是你最有力的武器，而不管结果如何，这场会面将会让你得知更多情报。你同意跟他们走，但以防万一，你一路上都对护送你的人保持警戒。\n"
"出乎你意料之外，你们搭著马车来到市中心的证券交易所。你跟著护送你的人穿越穿著华贵的忙碌人群，登上楼梯，走过上锁的大门来到建筑物顶层。你突然意识到这里不是单纯的交易所，而是结社的据点。门的另一边是间巨大的房间，装饰著许多文物跟中世纪欧洲的艺术品，包含一座穿著绯红色全套盔甲的骑士雕像。"

You’re surprised to find the man to be clearly of European descent, perhaps English or French. Though his hair is graying and thin, and his face wrinkled with long lines of worry, he seems surprisingly spry and large in stature. He rests his hand on a polished silver cane, but doesn’t seem to need it to walk. If you didn’t know any better, you would think him to be much younger than he lets on."
msgstr "这里的主人在你走进房间时欢迎你，他是一名看起来像是英裔或法裔的长者，他穿著一袭红色的古典正装，披著棕色的外套。“啊，客人来了。”他示意请你入座。他的口音明显来自欧洲，可能是英国或法国。虽然他满头白发、身形单薄，忧虑在他脸上刻下许多皱纹，但他身上散发著充满活力且威严的气息。他靠在一根锃亮的银色拐杖上，但看起来似乎并不需要靠它走路。如果要你猜的话，你觉得他并没有外表看起来这么年迈。"

"“I suppose you have many questions. First, introductions are in order. I have gone by several names in my long tenure, but you may simply call me the Claret Knight, as others do. I know why you are here. You come seeking this, do you not?” He unlocks a nearby armoire, and as its door opens, a flash of light illuminates the room. Inside is a crystal vial containing a shimmering sapphire substance. It is, without a doubt, the Key you have come here to find. Immediately, your mind races, brimming with possibility. But with many of the knight’s agents standing right behind you, you decide to stay on your best behavior… for now.\n"
"“We have guarded this implement—the Light of Pharos—for many years. Protected it from those who would use it to harm, rather than guide, humanity. Only we have the capacity to do so. To keep such powers out of the hands of knaves and troublemakers. Now, here is the issue: there is another who desires the Light of Pharos, one who is far less benevolent.”\n"
"The Beast, you suspect aloud. “Indeed,” the knight confirms. “And before you ask—yes, that creature is counted among the members of our esteemed organization.” You wonder aloud why two members of the Coterie might be squabbling instead of working together. “Yes, well, membership requirements have been lax in recent years,” he jokes with a chuckle. “The truth is, I bear no particular fondness for this Beast. Its methods are unsavory. It draws too much unwanted attention.” His eyes, deep and blue as a dark ocean, meet with yours to emphasize his point.\n"
"You remind your host that time is of the essence, and ask where this is leading. “Of course,” he obliges. “As I said, we have guarded this implement for countless generations. It would be a shame for it to fall into the hands of the unworthy or uncouth, would it not? But the Beast draws nigh. It spills the blood of friend, foe, and bystander in its path here. Its path to us. It is after the Light, and as the Light’s protector, I must do everything in my power to stop it. As such, I have summoned you here to strike a bargain.” He nods to one of his agents, who closes the armoire and seals it shut. There is a rush of air, and a sensation of building pressure throughout the room as the door shuts tight. Your ears pop with a painful change of pressure.\n"
"“This is a place of power, one of several throughout the city which we have established to prevent uninvited guests from entering. Had you not been escorted, you might have turned to ash. But any such locus can be destroyed, and then the Beast would descend upon us like a starving wolf. We cannot be everywhere at once. Help us defend the locuses, so that we may retain guardianship of the Light of Pharos. In return, I’ll tell you what you wish to know about our organization. And you will have prevented catastrophe from befalling this fair city, which has seen more than enough calamity already. What do you say? Can we rely upon you to make the right choice?”"

"“我相信你一定有很多疑问，但请先容我自我介绍，在我漫长的一生中有过许多称呼，但你可以和其他人一样，简单的称呼我为酒红骑士。我知道你为何而来，你正在寻找这个，对吗？”他打开旁边的一个柜子，当门打开时，一道光照亮了房间。柜中是一个透明的小瓶，里面装著蓝宝石色泽的液体，毫无疑问，这就是你在追寻的密钥。你的思绪飞快的运转起来，考虑著各种可能的方案，但在场有太多骑士的手下，你最后还是决定拿出你最礼貌的姿态……至少暂时这样。\n"
"“我们已经守护这个圣物：法罗斯之光很长一段时间了。保护它不落入作恶的人手中，我们用它来引导人类。只有我们有能力让它免于恶人与狂人的掌握。现在的问题是：有其他人觊觎法罗斯之光，一个远不能称为正派的人。”\n"
"是野兽，你大声说出推测。骑士确认了你的说法：“没错。而在你开口问前——没错，牠是我们荣誉结社的一员。”你说出你的疑问，为什么两名结社成员会互相冲突，而不是合作？“这个嘛，近年来入会的标准有点低。”骑士轻笑著开玩笑说。“事实上是，我对野兽没有好感，我无法认同牠的作风，牠吸引了太多不必要的注意。”他如海洋般深蓝色的双眼定睛注视你，彷佛想取得更多信任。\n"
"你提醒他时间不多，他到底想要什么？他回应：“当然。就像我说的，我们代代守护这个圣物，如果让它落到不对的人手中就太可惜了，不是吗？但野兽步步逼近，在牠看来，朋友、敌人，甚至毫不相关的人都只是牠前进路上的小小牺牲品。牠在逼近我们，逼近法罗斯之光。身为它的守护者，我必须尽我所能保护它的安全，所以我将你找来，提出一个交易。”他向其中一名手下点点头，手下将柜门关起并锁上。空气泛起一阵波动，柜门关上的同时，一股压力降临到整座建物上，你的耳朵在压力变化下感到一阵疼痛。\n"
"“这是一个力量之地，我们在城市中建造了数个这样的地方来防止不速之客。如果你不是被护送进来，就会被烧成灰烬。但这样的护所还是可能被摧毁，然后野兽就能像恶狼一般扑到我们身上。我们没办法同时身处数地，我们需要你的帮助守卫护所，才能维持法罗斯之光的防护圈。作为回报，我会告诉你关于我们组织的事。而同时你可以保护这座美丽的城市，它已经遭受过太多苦难了。你说呢？我可以仰赖你做出正确的选择吗？”"

I know why you are here. You come seeking that which we have guarded for many centuries. But even were I inclined to hand it over—which I am not—you are too late.” He gestures toward a nearby armoire, which has been torn nearly to shreds. Its door dangles from its hinges, and inside it is empty and dark.\n"
"“The Light of Pharos has been our charge in Alexandria for countless years. We have protected it from those who would use it to harm, rather than guide, humanity. But, I am afraid it has been stolen. And as such, until we can recover it, we are at war.”\n"
"The Beast, you suspect aloud. “Indeed,” the knight confirms. “And before you ask—yes, that creature is counted among the members of our esteemed organization.” You wonder aloud why two members of the Coterie might be in conflict instead of working together. “Yes, well, I fought tooth and nail to prevent it from joining our ranks, if you’ll pardon the pun,” he says grimly. “The truth is, I despise this Beast. Its methods are unsavory. It draws too much unwanted attention.” His eyes, deep and blue as a dark ocean, meet with yours as he emphasizes his point.\n"
"You remind your host that time is of the essence, and ask where this is leading. “Of course,” he obliges. “Surely we agree that we cannot let this implement remain in the hands of such a monster. It would be safer here, under lock and key, where it has been for countless generations. As its protector, I must do everything in my power to recover it. As such, I have summoned you here to strike a bargain.” He nods to one of his agents, who shows you a map of the city. Marked in several spots are buildings circled in red.\n"
"“These are locuses—places of power that were established throughout the city to prevent uninvited guests from entering a particular stronghold. They were once linked to this place, but now, this power has been usurped by the Beast. The Light of Pharos is somewhere in the city, protected by our very own magic. If we can destroy each locus and enter the Beast’s lair, we can take back the artifact and retain it here, where it belongs. In return, I’ll tell you what you wish to know about our organization. And you will have prevented catastrophe from befalling this fair city, which has seen more than enough calamity already. What do you say? Can we rely upon you to make the right choice?”"

"“A shame,” the knight intones, his tenor changing almost immediately. “Very well. We shall have to deal with this threat ourselves, and I am afraid I must ask you to leave the city at once.” You protest, but the knight’s agents close in around you. He rises to a stature you did not expect from such an elderly man, his voice commanding the kind of authority mentioned only in myth. “You are no longer guests in my city. We will not suffer a war on two fronts. Depart from Alexandria immediately or suffer the consequences.”\n"
"Although it pains you to leave when your goal lies so close, if what the knight said is true, you would have to break the various locuses around the city in order to claim your prize, and you are surrounded and outnumbered, besides. You decide it is best to exit the Coterie’s stronghold and regroup before making a run at the Key.\n"
"But, as is often the case, fate has other plans. The moment you leave the Bourse, you are accosted by a man in a pinstripe suit and a red fez. Bewilderingly, he flashes a Foundation badge and makes a motion to follow him into a nearby alley. You make sure you aren’t still being watched, then abscond into the alleyway, where the man greets you in English. “Hossam Sirry, at your service. Commissioner Taylor told me you’d be coming. That dossier you got? I put that intel together myself.” You study the man’s face for a moment. Unlike the so-called Claret Knight and his Coterie entourage up in the Bourse, he looks native to the area, with brown skin, dark brown eyes and a chiseled, stubbled jawline. Still, your eyes cannot help but dance warily to the one article of red he wears upon his head. He rolls his eyes and gives a slight chuckle. “Do not worry. I am not with them. You would be hard pressed to find this kind of headwear in any other color.” You let out a sigh of relief. “I take it from the way you were escorted out of there that you didn’t take their offer?”\n"
"You tell Agent Sirry what happened inside the Bourse. “You made the right call,” he says. “Those Coterie dogs have been entrenched in Alexandria for as long as anyone can remember. They think this city is theirs, but it’s not. It belongs to the people. It belongs to us.” His disdain is unmistakable. It’s not just for the Coterie—it’s for the people who aim to wrest control of the city away from those who call it home. “They come here from afar and act like their governance, their occupation, is some kind of gift.”\n"
"Agent Sirry puts a hand on your shoulder. “Let us help one another. Your objective is to claim the knight’s Key for your own, yes? This will also weaken the Coterie’s control over this city. That is a result I can get behind.” You nod in agreement. This conflict may not be as personal for you as it is for Sirry, but you’ll stop at nothing to help."

"“可惜。”骑士叹了口气，语气瞬间改变。“很好，我们会独自面对这个威胁，但我恐怕必须要求你立即离开这座城市。”你不同意，但骑士的手下开始向你逼近。骑士起身，你没想过一名老人身上能散发出这种压迫感，他带著天神般的威严命令道：“你在我的城市中不再受到欢迎，我们不会放任自己同时面对两名对手。立刻离开，不然就准备承担后果。”\n"
"在目标唾手可得的状况下打退堂鼓令你感到痛苦。但如果骑士所言不虚，你必须破坏数个护所才能夺得你的目标，而你不但四面楚歌也寡不敌众。你决定最好先离开结社的要塞，重整态势后再继续寻找密钥。\n"
"但是命运通常都有意想不到的安排。你一离开交易所，就有一名穿条纹西装，带著红色土耳其帽的男子走上前。奇怪的是，他快速向你展示一个看起来像基石的徽章，示意你到旁边的巷子谈话。你确认自己没有被监视后跟著他走进巷子，他用英语向你问好：“霍萨姆·西里，供你差遣。调查官泰勒说过你会来。你拿到的那个卷宗是我搜集的情报。”你看著他的外表，他与酒红骑士那群人不同，他是本地人，有深色的皮肤跟深棕色的眼睛，下巴的线条方正，留著小胡子。但是你的视线还是不自主的飘向他的红色帽子。他翻了个白眼轻笑道：“别担心，我跟他们不是一伙的，你很难找得到其他颜色的这种帽子。”你松了口气。“看你被送出来的样子，我想你没有接受他们的条件对吧？”\n"
"你告诉西里探员在交易所中发生的事。“你的选择是对的。打从任何人有记忆起，那些结社走狗在亚历山卓一直都根深蒂固。他们认为这座城市是他们的，但并不是，这里应该是属于人民的，属于我们的。”他的激奋溢于言表，不只是针对结社，同时也是对于那些想要控制自己家乡的外来者们的怨恨。“这些远道而来的侵略者们表现的一副他们的统治、他们的侵占，是一种礼物。”\n"
"西里探员将手放上你的肩膀。“我们可以互相帮助。你的目标是取得骑士的密钥对吧？这将削弱结社对这座城市的控制，也是我所乐见的结果。”你点头同意，这场冲突对你来说虽然不像西里探员一样出自于私人恩怨，但你依然会全力以赴。"

He has cleaned up a bit since you last met him, and there is a brightness in his eyes and his smile that was not present before. He joyfully sums up what has occurred since you went dark. “The knight and his entourage seem to have left Alexandria,” he declares, wearing a satisfied grin. “It seems, for all their posturing about ‘guiding humanity’ and ‘rightful rule,’ the moment their relic left their hands, their stake in the city vanished with it. That other creature seems to have fled as well. Still…” His eyes dance to the vessel containing the Key, its light trapped within. “I doubt you’ve seen the last of them. In fact, I’d wager a guess that one or both are hot on your tail. Be careful.”\n"

He and that hideous creature are in all-out war now, and of course, my people are the ones who suffer.” He slams his fist on the table in anger. “That’s how it always is with these bastards. They’ll do whatever they can to stay in power, innocents be damned. Frankly, I can’t even tell which of them is worse.”\n"
"You apologize that you weren’t able to help more, and he shakes his head. “No, don’t apologize. You did everything you could. What will you do now?” Your window of opportunity in Alexandria has passed, so you tell Agent Sirry you’ll be taking the next train out to search for more Keys elsewhere. You wonder aloud if he might come with you. “I have a new assignment as well, but…” he scratches his beard thoughtfully. “I fear what may come to pass in my beloved city with this feud going on. I might end up staying. Orders or no orders.” He stands and shakes your hand, and you fear it may be the last time. “I hope to see you again some time. Until then… I have work to do.”"

"You are escorted by agents in red back to your patron’s office safehouse within the Bourse. The place has been cleaned up significantly since you were last there, and a brand new vault sits next to the grand painting of the familiar scarlet-clad knight. You hand over the Key as agreed, and it is placed back inside the vault and sealed shut. There is a rush of air, and a sensation of building pressure throughout the room as the door shuts tight. Your ears pop with a painful change of pressure—no doubt the work of their so-called “locuses.”\n"

You find it ironic that the Coterie, who claim to only want to protect humanity, would put the people of Alexandria in such danger.

msgid "You ask the knight what the Red Coterie is truly about. So far, you have seen its members be both brutal and reasonable. And why all the secrecy? “I have not lied to you. We seek only to protect humanity.” He points to the vault wherein the Light of Pharos is still safely sealed away. “These objects, they are too powerful to be wielded by just anyone, and too precious to be kept unaccounted. I’m sure by now you have noticed the influence of other entities upon our world. Outsiders, we call them. These relics are the only line of defense against such entities. The Coterie keeps them safe, to be used only to do battle with the Outsiders. That is why I could not suffer this artifact to fall into the hands of that beast. Aliki is the one who does most of our research regarding the Outsiders—if you wish to know more, perhaps find her. Last anyone heard from her was around Kathmandu, I believe. But you will need to find a translator if you wish to speak with her. She is cryptic and difficult to understand.” He glances at the portrait of the knight clad in crimson armor that looms behind him. “As for all the red… handling relics of an otherworldly nature is both dangerous and conspicuous. So, we have bound them to one or more articles of clothing, to better blend in with society. The process, for whatever reason, turns them red. Of course, there are other benefits too. Think of it as a… secret handshake, if you will.” He raises an eyebrow as he appraises you. “We have, in the past, inducted new members into our ranks, should they prove themselves both trustworthy and capable, as you have. Perhaps one day you shall bear red upon your person, as well. Now, I believe I have fulfilled my end of this bargain. I once again thank you for your aid. My people will compensate your travel expenses.” With that, the conversation comes to a friendly, if abrupt end."
