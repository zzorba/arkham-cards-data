"As it turns out, finding the Red Coterie operating out of Havana is the easiest part of your trip to Cuba. According to your intel, Mr. Álvarez can often be seen spending his nights at Café Luna—a hot spot among the locals and American tourists looking to escape the iron jaws of Prohibition. Open at nearly all hours of the night and serving a variety of liquors that would make even the most seasoned bootlegger’s eyes bulge, the bar has become one of the most popular in all of Havana.\n"
"You arrive at peak hours, hoping to use the crowd to blend in. For all you know, Mr. Álvarez may have been warned of your approach. As soon as you arrive, you are greeted by an array of bright lights and a crowd almost too thick to squeeze past. Live jazz resounds from within the club, and many are dancing and reveling—some before they even get inside. A bouncer in a black pinstripe suit greets you at the door, giving you the once-over but not bothering to pat you down, ask for a password, or any of the usual hoops you might have to jump through back in the speakeasies hidden throughout the States.\n"
"Once inside, you head straight for the bartender and struggle to get his attention. You order a drink as a cover, but his expression changes the moment you say that you’re looking for a Mr. Desiderio Álvarez. Eyes narrow with suspicion, he nonetheless nods in the direction of a roped-off hallway in the back corner of the room, guarded by two more suits. Both of them flank you as you approach, and follow you into what you can only assume to be the club’s VIP section. There, in a dim, smoky back room, sits none other than the “man in the blood-soaked suit,” so named for the red accents adorning his otherwise black suit—or perhaps it is simply a metaphor. He inhales slowly from a cigarette hanging loosely from his lips as he appraises you. Across from him sit two others, an elderly Cuban gent in a red suit vest, puffing on a thick cigar, and a dangerous-looking woman in a red dress who sips from a martini glass. All three of them have murder in their eyes.\n"
"“Who are these idiotas?” Mr. Álvarez asks one of the guards escorting you.\n"
"“They asked to speak with you, Desi,” the man stammers.\n"
"“Oh. Well, pour ‘em something hard, will you? Don’t just stand there.” After a quick nod, your escort jaunts out of the room, leaving you with the three apparent Coterie agents. “Come, sit.” You politely turn down a variety of smokes and take a seat at the table. “So you were looking for me?”\n"
"You nod and inform Mr. Álvarez that he is a person of interest in your investigation, that you knew he often frequented this very bar, and that you were hoping to simply ask him a few questions. Without hesitation, the woman in red pulls a long knife from out of seemingly nowhere. But the man in the suit holds out his hand, and she slides the blade back into her garter belt, covering it with the fabric of her dress."

"找寻绯红结社在哈瓦那的踪迹是你这趟古巴之旅中最简单的部分。根据情报，阿瓦雷兹先生通常把夜晚都花在月下咖啡厅，一间同时受到当地人及旅客欢迎的酒吧，在这里美国人可以暂时逃离国家禁酒令的箝制。这间酒吧几乎彻夜营业，这里提供的各式美酒即使最老道的酒客都无法保持清醒，因此这间酒吧成为哈瓦那最热门的景点之一。\n"
"你在尖峰时刻抵达酒吧，希望能混入人群中。你猜测阿瓦雷兹先生已经知道你的到来。炫目的灯光与拥挤到不可能穿越的人群迎接你的到来，夜总会中传出爵士乐团的演奏，许多人甚至还没进入店内就已经开始跳舞狂欢。一名穿著条纹西装的接待员招呼你，他草草的看你一眼后就让你进入了，没有搜身、没有暗号，也没有在美国私酒馆常见的那些刁难。\n"
"走进店内后你迳直走向吧台，试著引起酒保的注意。你随便点了一杯饮料作为搭话的借口，但酒保听到你想找德西德里奥·阿瓦雷兹先生时脸色大变。他的眼睛怀疑的瞇了起来，他朝著房间黑暗角落的一道走廊示意，走廊前被绳子挡住，旁边还有两名穿著西装的人守卫著。他们在你朝著应该是VIP区的地方走时跟在你后方。在一个昏暗、烟雾弥漫的包间中坐著“血红西装”本人，也许是得名于他黑西装上的红色配件，也可能是暗示他从事的工作内容。他边缓缓著吸著唇边的香烟边打量著你。有两个人坐在他对面，一位是穿著红色西装背心的年长古巴绅士，正抽著巨大的雪茄；另一位身著红色礼服、外表危险的女子正小口啜饮著马丁尼。他们三人眼中都散发著杀意。\n"
"“这个白痴是谁？”阿瓦雷兹先生质问其中一名守卫。\n"
"守卫结巴著回答：“他说想见您，德西。”\n"
"“这样啊，那去帮他倒杯喝的来吧，不要只会站在那。”守卫快速的点头回应后就离开了房间，留下你与三名结社成员。“请坐。“你礼貌地拒绝了香烟并在桌边坐下。“所以，你在找我？”\n"
"你点头并告诉阿瓦雷兹先生他是你调查中的关键人物，你得知他经常会出现在这间酒吧，你只是想询问他几个简单的问题。听到这里，那名女子毫不犹豫的凭空抽出一把长刀对著你，但阿瓦雷兹示意她停手，那名女子随即将刀收回隐藏在礼服下的腰带。"

"Desi sighs and opens up to you, much to the chagrin of his two companions, who look on with surprise. “Something’s been after my crew in Havana. Started with some new blood who went off-grid all of a sudden. Then a couple longtimers. Just gone,” he says with a snap of his fingers. “At first, I thought it was just some uppity rivals looking to expand their territory. Fools who don’t know who I really am. The kinda scum who’d run this city into the ground.” He ashes his cigarette, staring into the ashes like there is some greater meaning inside to sift through. “Weird part is, I don’t remember their names. Nobody does. Sounds weird, right? I never forget a name. Never.” His gaze locks with yours, cold as stone. “Now I’m starting to suspect something worse. The kinda thing your people deal with.”\n"
"You wonder aloud if this is the kind of thing his people are also supposed to be dealing with.\n"
"“Don’t lump me in with the rest of them,” he chides. “I’ve got other fish on my menu. Now—you got two choices. You either help me out with my little problem, or me and my buddies here throw you to the curb. Which is it gonna be?”\n"
"After a moment of thought, you tell Desi that you’ll help if he gives you the location of any known Keys and relinquishes any he might have in his possession. The other two Coterie agents lock eyes with Desi in vain, but he has already made up his mind.\n"
"He extends his hand. “Deal. But I want in. We’ll do this together. Nobody messes with my crew and gets away with it. Come back here tomorrow night—same time, same place.” You nod and depart, booking a room at the Plaza Hotel in Old Havana and getting some much-needed rest before tomorrow’s investigation."

"德西的两位同伴在他对你全盘托出时惊讶的抬头看著他。“我在哈瓦那的手下出了一些问题，一开始是一些新人突然消失无踪，后来连一些老伙计都不见了。就像这样，”他弹了一下手指，“一开始我以为是敌对组织想扩展势力，一些不知道我是谁的笨蛋，那种会把这个城市搞的乌烟瘴气的蠢货。”他熄掉香烟，盯著烟灰若有所思，彷佛灰烬中隐藏了什么预兆。“最奇怪的是，我不记得他们的名字了，没人记得。听起来很怪不是吗？而且我从不会忘记人的名字，从来没有。”他冷若冰霜的看著你说：“现在我开始怀疑是其他问题导致这一切，那种你们这种人专门处理的问题。”\n"
"你心想著他们不也同样经常面对这种问题吗。\n"

Thought they were bumped off by local gangs or the like. The kinda scum who’d run this city into the ground. But now…” He shakes his head, forehead wrinkled with worry. “I don’t remember who they were. Nobody does. And it’s more of ‘em every day. And every time, boom,” he snaps his fingers, “gone, no memory of them existing, only the faintest recollection that they were here and now they’re not.” He locks narrow eyes with you. “Sound familiar?”\n"
"You nod. This is all awfully familiar. You tell Desi that you’ll help him figure out what’s going on if he gives you the location of any known Keys and relinquishes any he might have in his possession. The woman bites her lip and glances at Desi, wondering if he will agree.\n"

Thinking that Desi must have shut the place down for the night so you and his crew could plan your investigation without being disturbed, you try the handle. Confirming your suspicions, the door opens without any trouble, and you head inside.\n"
"The bar is eerily dim and quiet as you make your way to the back room. Having seen what the place looks like during a typical night, full of live music and reveling tourists, you feel a bit unnerved. Your steps echo quietly over the dance floor across from the bar. A nearby stool creaks.\n"
"It is too quiet.\n"
"You have no time to process whether you’re in danger. The moment the thought crosses your mind, a hail of gunfire erupts all around you. An ambush!

You can’t help but continue to scan Desi’s eyes for any sign—any at all—that he is not who he claims to be. You find none. Or perhaps the mimic simply knows how to act now that it has been in his skin for so long? “Well,” he interrupts your thoughts, “I guess I owe you my end of the bargain. ‘Blackbird Solitaire.’”\n"

I think most of ‘em don’t understand what I’m really up to most nights.” As if sensing your next question, a smile crawls along his lips. “Cleaning up the city, that is.” He flicks his cigarette into a wet puddle, not seeming to understand the irony in the act. “Anyway—7th Avenue. Old condemned cigar factory. You can’t miss it. Got at least one of those things you’re after stored inside. Just give it a week or two before they get the message about the new passphrase. Then it’s all yours.” Then Desi loads a new magazine into his Thompson and turns to address his crew. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some imposters to root out.” You decide to leave before you’re forced to know exactly how he plans to do that."
