"You and Flint meet at the Royal Selangor Club: a sharp-angled complex situated on the edge of a meticulously groomed lawn. A cricket match unfolds for the club members on the turf below as you and Flint discuss the Coterie’s interests and Tzu San Niang’s possible aims. “Hold on a moment,” Flint stops mid-sip and stares into the throng of wealthy expatriates. You turn your head and watch the crowd. A woman with a pale complexion and jet-black hair turns away from you, twirling a bright red parasol.\n"
"“Well, that was easy,” laughs Flint. You can hear a steely edge in his voice as he stands, gingerly, and leaves a generous tip for the staff. “Let’s see what she’s up to, shall we?”"

"你与弗林特在皇家雪兰莪俱乐部碰面，这座尖顶建筑旁有一大片精心维护的草地。当你与弗林特正在讨论梓三娘可能的目标时，一场俱乐部会员间的板球赛正在下方的草坪上进行。“等等。”弗林特停下举到嘴边的杯子突然看向一群富有的外国人，你转头也看向人群，刚好看见一名有著白皙皮肤，留著乌黑长发的女子转身，旋转著手中鲜红色的阳伞。\n"
"“好吧，得来全不费工夫。”弗林特笑了出来。他谨慎的站起身，留下一笔慷慨的小费。“走吧，我们去看看她想搞什么鬼。”你从他的声音中听到了坚毅的决心。"

"You arrive in Kuala Lumpur filled with a gnawing, terrible fear. As you negotiate the fare to the railway station, your sense of foreboding only grows. The air is full of intoxicating, overwhelming scents: juicy grilled meats, chewed betel nut, wisps of incense. All of it fills your senses and reminds you how far you are from home. After your driver drops you off at the bustling railway station, you wander the platforms and rail offices, but all your inquiries are met with blank indifference.\n"
"Amidst the steam of a retreating train, you see a brilliant red parasol held by a beautiful woman with jet black hair. You barely have time to react before she melts into the bustle, but you have to wonder: is this an unlikely coincidence, or a Coterie trap? Either way, it’s the only lead you have."

"你抱著忐忑不安的心情抵达了吉隆坡。当你在与司机讨价还价的同时，不祥的预感越来越强。空气中醉人的气味将你包围：烤肉的香味、嚼过的槟榔、萦绕的焚香。冲击著你的感官，再再提醒你自己离家有多远。你在繁忙火车站下车后，在月台与铁路办公处之间游荡，但你询问的所有人都怀著苍白的冷漠。\n"
"突然，在离站火车喷出的烟雾间，你看见一把鲜红色的阳伞，拿著它的人是一名美丽的黑发女子。在她消失在熙攘的人群间前你差点来不及反应过来。但你不禁怀疑：这是个离奇的巧合；还是结社设下的陷阱？但不管怎样，这是你唯一的线索。"

"Before you even step inside the shop, you are greeted by the intense but pleasant fragrance of dried flowers and herbs that hang in bundles from the low ceiling. The scent is intoxicating. As your eyes adjust to the dimly lit interior, a small middle-aged Malay woman in an ornate dress rises from her stool in the corner to greet you.\n"
"“You’re a bit late, but I suppose it’s better than if you had arrived early,” she says matter-of-factly. You ask her what she means, and she shakes her head. “I’m Melati. Our meeting was foretold.” She explains that she is a bomoh, or shaman, and that she was forewarned of your meeting by the spirits. You ask her about the woman with the red parasol.\n"
"“Yes, that’s why I was glad you didn’t arrive early,” she grimaces, then lights a bundle of some aromatic herbs. You feel a tingling lightheadedness wash over you, followed by soothing calm. Melati goes on: “That was Tzu San Niang. She’s the reason I have to cleanse my shop. There is a foul essence that follows her. Perhaps why she masks her unclean spirit with a veneer of politeness.” As Melati speaks, a cloud of vague confusion passes over her, as if she cannot place something. You ask her what Ms. Tzu wanted.\n"
"“I truly can’t even remember what she asked of me.”"

"踏进店铺前你已经闻到一股强烈的药味，无数干燥的花束与药草悬挂在天花板上，味道宜人。当你的眼睛适应昏暗的灯光后，你看见一名矮小的中年女子，她穿著装饰繁杂的连身裙，从角落的凳子起身迎接你。\n"
"“你有一点来晚了，但我想比你早到要好一点。”她用理所当然的口吻说。你问她是什么意思，但她只是摇摇头。“我叫梅拉蒂，我预见过这场会面。”她解释自己是一名波霍姆，或叫做萨满。而她被魂灵告知你与她将有一次会面。你询问她关于红伞女子的事。\n"
"“对，这就是我很高兴你没有早来的原因。”她做了个鬼脸，然后点燃一束药草，你感到一阵强烈的晕眩感，但晕眩过去后马上变成了一阵舒畅的平静。梅拉蒂继续说：“她叫梓三娘，有个邪秽的东西跟著她，这就是为什么我要净化我的店。也许她的温柔婉约就是要用来掩饰那个不洁的魂灵。”当梅拉蒂讲话的同时，脸上闪过一丝模糊的迟疑，好像她无法想起某事一样。你问她梓三娘想要什么。\n"
"“我真的不记得她想从我这里得到什么了。”"

"The bomoh recites a low, mumbling chant as she completes the cleansing ritual, then holds one hand to her temple. Her brow furrows as she falls to her knees, wracked with pain. You move to help her up, and she holds one hand out, steadying herself against the low wooden table, and then slides to sit. She gestures for you to sit across from her.\n"
"“Now I understand why they told me you were coming,” she smiles bravely. The deep lines in her face fold with shadows in the dim shop. The bomoh pours you a cup of hot, steaming tea. “The spirits are restless. Something has stirred up a deep well of pain as the city reforms itself to keep up with such change. People coming and going. And in all of it, I sense a dark aura: a cloud of misfortune. And at the center of it, the lady with the red parasol. She is a harbinger of sorts. Inflicting pain and misery even as she reaps the rewards of great industry.”\n"
"The bomoh’s voice is firm and clear, even as her hands shake, holding her tea cup. You sip the rich, earthy brew as you consider the situation. Tzu San Niang has some greater design at work, but what? You ask Melati if the spirits have told her anything else. She shakes her head.\n"
"“I sense only their great pain. And that their great pain is linked, in some way, to the lady with the red parasol. It is almost as though she feeds on it. Devours it.”"

"萨满低声吟诵一段祷文，完成了净化仪式。然后她突然按住太阳穴，眉头一皱跌在地上，痛苦的颤抖著。你走上前将她扶起，让她靠在低矮的木桌上，将她扶进座位，她挥手示意你在对面入座。\n"
"“现在我懂为什么祂们要宣告你会来了。”她坚强的微笑，昏暗的灯光在她脸上深刻的线条留下阴影。萨满帮你倒了一杯热气腾腾的茶，然后说道：“魂灵们在躁动。某种存在搅动了痛苦的深渊，城市也随之开始产生变化。在这之中，我感应到一股黑暗的灵气，一团由不幸组成的阴云。而一切的中心就是那个拿著鲜红阳伞的女子，她是毁灭的预兆，她收割著各大产业的利润，同时造成无数的痛苦与悲伤。”\n"
"即使她握著茶杯的手颤抖不止，但她的语气坚定而清晰。你啜了一口充满大地香气的茶，边分析著情况。梓三娘正在进行一个大计画，但是什么呢？你问梅拉蒂魂灵是否有告诉她其他事情，但她摇摇头。\n"
"“我只感应到巨大的痛苦，而这些苦痛与那位红伞女士是有某种关联的。就好像她以苦难为食，正在吞噬它们。”"

"Melati doubles over again, clutching one hand to her chest. You move to help her as Inspector Flint produces a small med kit to administer emergency aid. The bomoh shakes her head.\n"
"“Do not worry for me. I am stronger than any spirit, though I feel they are in such deep, awful pain. The city is rife with sorrow.” She sighs and rights herself. “As I said before, our meeting was not by any chance. Perhaps if we can speak with the spirits, put them to rest, we can understand Ms. Tzu’s greater aims and, perhaps, thwart them. Can you help me?”\n"
"Flint looks to you, and to the bomoh, and smiles. “We’ll help you get to the bottom of this.”"

"梅拉蒂再度抽搐，一手抓著胸口，你试著帮助她，而弗林特不知从哪拿出了一个小急救箱准备进行急救。但萨满摇了摇头。\n"
"“别担心我，我比任何一个灵魂都坚强。虽然我感受到如此深层、切身的痛苦，这个城市充斥著悲痛。”她叹口气并坐直身子。“就像我刚才说的，我们的会面不是偶然。也许我们可以与灵魂沟通，并让祂们安息。也许我们可以得知梓小姐的目标并阻止她，你们会帮我吗？”\n"

"Melati doubles over, clutching one hand to her chest. You move to help her, pulse racing, as her eyes roll back in her head. The fit passes, and she lets out a heavy sigh. “Your friend just spoke to me. Li. Li Flint.” Your blood runs cold as she says the name. The bomoh’s eyes glisten in the dim as she lights a candle.\n"
"“I am sorry to deliver such terrible news, but his spirit is in agony. He spoke of Ms. Tzu and her cruelty. Even now, she drinks his despair, feeds on it, as you or I consume food. I think I understand now.” She pauses, takes a sip of her tea, and looks gravely at you. “Ms. Tzu consumes the agony of the departed. Feeds on it. The city is rife with sorrow. I know we have only just met, but can you help me?”\n"

"“我很抱歉带来这个糟糕的消息。他的灵魂正在受苦，控诉著梓小姐的残忍。就在这个当下，她仍畅饮著他的绝望，就如同进食一般，现在我懂了。”她停顿，啜了一口茶，然后沉重的看著你说道：“梓小姐以苦痛为食，受其滋养，而这座城市充斥著悲痛。我知道我们刚才认识，但你可以帮我吗？”\n"

But, also, all you were doing was proving your worth to me. I can sense your devotion. Are you not devoted to me?” Your mouth forms the word, but your mind resists as you say: “Yes.” Tzu San Niang nods, smiling. “This is the beginning of a wonderful partnership, I think.”\n"
