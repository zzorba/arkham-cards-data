"Days pass as you recuperate from the arduous campaign against the Colour.  Though driven out, the alien influence will leave scars that may never fade, on the mind, body, and the land of Oz.  Ozma and Glinda focus on restoring life to the fairy country, but their magic is no equal of the Colour's unknowable nature.  You endure many grateful visitors and well-wishers, but your recovery seems fastest when your only company are the few valiant citizens of Oz who also fought and survived alongside you.  Dorothy in particular spends as much time as she can seeing to your swift recovery, having grown quite fond of you over the harrowing adventure.\n"
"The time at last arrives when you are summoned to Ozma's throne room, but not to a grand ceremony.  The queen of Oz sits with a serious expression, with Glinda aloofly beside her.  \"Further words cannot express our deep gratitude for undertaking this fight,\" Ozma states serenely, \"and we will do everything in our power to prepare should the Colour ever return.  This is the path before us, but your path is for you alone to decide.  We realize that you may have obligations outside of Oz that you must attend to, and we shall return you at once.  However, if you wish it, we also welcome you to stay in Oz as a full citizen.  With the Colour gone, the magic of Oz will hide it from the world once more, and there will be no return.\""

msgid "While Oz may be endearing in its own ways, there are terrible evils that still haunt the world, every bit as horrid and destructive as the Colour out of space.  There are few like you that have the strength of mind and body and the willingness to seek them out, and without your contributions, the world may soon fall to another cataclysm already building now.  The assembled elite of Oz give you many fond and tearful farewells before Ozma and Glinda at last weave the magic to transport you in the blink of an eye back to your home in Arkham.  You will never forget your adventure in Oz, but there is work to be done... starting with an explanation for the Miskatonic faculty about your findings.  What became of the rest of the expedition, anyway?"

msgid "Compared to the rest of Oz, your life before now was a grim affair, with only further horrors expected.  This offer to stay in an enchanted place like Oz may only come once in a lifetime, and lives like yours are short and dangerous.  People have always risen up through human history to combat lurking evils, and you have done your part.  Your decision to stay is met with great joy, with many promises of gifts and favors following the reconstruction of Oz.  As you fade into the mists along with the rest of the fairy country, you take a cautious but relieved attitude.  There may be more adventures for you here in Oz, but this closes the book on the strangest and most tragic of them."

"So ends the Colour Out of Oz!  I've had an Oz campaign of some kind in the back of my head as far back as when I was working on Alice in Wonderland, so I'm quite happy to finally make it happen.\n"
"Some people may be familiar with the Return to Oz movie from the 80's that was a much darker take, and that movie did help inspire me to get working.  However, like with Alice in Wonderland, I felt it more respectful to the source material to have dark things happen to Oz rather than twist it into something it never was.  As with all my works based on existing stories, I read the Oz books written by L. Frank Baum before figuring out what kind of campaign to make.  Since Baum made stories for children, most of the books with direct villains had them turn good or forever made harmless by the end of the book (even the famous Wicked Witch of the West is rarely mentioned after the first book!) which meant the trouble really had to be an outside source.  I eventually decided on the Colour Out of Space in part because of the four colorful quadrants of Oz, and because it led to the formation of the decay mechanic.\n"
"Now I'm sure that most people playing this campaign haven't read the books, and aren't very familiar with most of the characters in the campaign.  I hadn't heard of most of them before I did my prep work.  However, each of the books had a similar formula in that the protagonist (usually Dorothy) would set out on a journey of some kind accompanied by friends both old and new.  Whether or not people knew the characters, I wanted to keep that formula, so the companion mechanic helped keep that feeling without stuffing a dozen allies into player decks.\n"
"On the other side of source material, the Colour Out of Space is a slow degradation over months at the Gardner farm, which doesn't make for a lot of exciting gameplay.  The campaign also needed a reason for the investigators to not immediately squelch the Colour at the meteor crater, and thankfully the Nomes and their earth powers made for a convenient escape.  Additionally, the need for the Oz brand of magic to vanquish the Colour helped mix the two stories further, since there technically is no way of fighting the Colour in its original story either.  It just drains the land and leaves.  All of these factors added up to a fairly clean story that gave the investigators plenty to do, including being the authority on alien beings to keep them central to the plot.\n"
"I hope you enjoyed this mash-up, and I'll see you next time!"
