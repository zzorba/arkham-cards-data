msgid ""
"You march through the Emerald City once more on a path to the palace, trying your best to seem confident for the desperate citizens as you pass.  This city is the only uncorrupted spot left in Oz, no doubt owing to the larger meteor in this incident causing a more rapid spread and wider range of decay.  You rallied what help and advantages you could from the four surrounding countries over the grueling past days, racing against time each step of the way.  Will your efforts bear fruit?  Now is the time to discover.\n"
"The door to Ozma's throne room stands open, and you are greeted by the queen and her companions.  The atmosphere is a mixture of determination and desperation, and most of your allies look wearier and wiser for the travails you've shared.  Perhaps a little of Arkham has grown in them, for better or worse."

msgid "You've seen those looks before.  It's how you felt the first time that you were exposed to these kinds of cosmic evils.  You make a quick appraisal and try to bolster the most affected allies."

msgid "<b>The Wizard</b> loiters near Glinda and Ozma, digging through his bag of magical implements with a focused expression.  \"It's simply impossible for nothing to slow the spread... there must be a formula I haven't tried yet, or perhaps some reagent we could find for a more potent --\"  He looks up to you with a sudden start, but breathes a nervous sigh.  \"I do apologize.  I feel as though I'm nearing obsession with our fight against the horrid Colour.  Is this... how you've felt from the very start?  Utterly ghastly...\""

msgid "<b>The Scarecrow</b> stands facing the wall, as he often does when he ponders deeply.  The closer you get, the more loudly you can hear a soft muttering from the straw man, and you see him mouthing words as he stares.  Your footsteps snap him out of a trance and he turns back toward you, still trying to look jolly.  \"Welcome, my good friend!  I was attempting to puzzle out the problem of the Colour in a new way.  It is from space, so I must think like something out of space to improve our chances.  It is a highly... unsettling line of thinking.  It almost feels as if there is something out there listening...\""

msgid "<b>The Tin Woodman</b> runs his metal hands over his frame, knocking and scratching intermittently as he tests the joints in sporadic bursts.  \"Do you hear that?\" he wonders aloud as he taps on his tin body, \"It is a duller sound, do you not suppose?  It as though I am filled with something to muffle the tin, but I feel emptier than usual.\"  He gazes back down at the polished metal and shakes his head worriedly.  \"Is it even the right color?  Is it... the Colour?  Surely not... but should the worst come to pass, I will need to replace my body entirely.  It must be done if it must be done...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>Tik-Tok</b> keeps in constant motion, pacing noisily but methodically through the royal hall.  The grinding of his gears grates a little louder than usual, as if he is putting more force into routine movements.  He speaks to you as he draws close, but does not stop moving.  \"There must be or-der to ev-er-y-thing.  One gear can-not move with-out the oth-ers, and each gear keeps its neigh-bors in or-der.  I must keep my gears mo-ving to stop the Co-lour from dis-rup-ting or-der.\""

msgid "<b>Jack Pumpkinhead</b> sits on the steps of Ozma's throne, running one long wooden finger along the bottom of his carved mouth.  He looks to you with the same expression as ever, but somehow it looks apprehensive.  \"There are a great many things that I do not understand, but I understand why I do not understand them.  The Colour is different.  I do not understand why I do not understand it.  Do you understand?\"  You can only shrug at this question, and Jack shrugs back at you.  \"Oh how I wish I had better seeds in my head.  Maybe then my brains could stand a chance at this.\""

msgid "<b>The Patchwork Girl</b> is back to her constant spinning and tumbling, but she is stumbling and falling with alarming frequency.  She sits on the ground wobbling slightly with one palm against her forehead as you approach.  \"I suppose this is how being dizzy feels like.  I've never once been dizzy, but I've heard from Dorothy and the others after they spin that the world just keeps moving while you stand still.  I haven't lost my sense of balance, have I?  That's not something the Colour can change, can it?  Or maybe the whole world is really spinning a bit and I've only just noticed!\"  She laughs, but the dazed tone of voice still carries through."
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Frogman</b> sits in a chair off to the side, fingers steepled in front of his face.  He muses loud enough for you to hear him at a short distance.  \"What use is truth and wisdom against a foe that cares nothing for either?  The Colour changes everything to suit its purposes in spite of my insights.  It seems that all I have to rely on right now are the legs I was born with.  Perhaps it would have been better to stay an ignorant little frog in the face of this catastrophe...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>Cap'n Bill</b> leans against a wall, whittling at a block of wood patiently to compensate for his unsteady hands.  From what you can tell, the design isn't anything recognizable, just a strange mishmash of patterns resembling symbols.  You ask Bill what the carvings mean, but he only shakes his head.  \"An attempt to get these visions out of my head.  The Colour is making me -- making all of us -- see things that we rightly shouldn't.  Carving things gives a sailor control over them in a small way, but that may be more than I can hope.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>Shaggy Man</b> stands near the door to throne room, sighing wistfully.  As you approach, he wipes tears from his eyes and tries to lift himself out of his melancholy.  \"In all my travels, I've never found a place as beautiful and wondrous as Oz... but now it's in ruins.  The Colour -- what a name for this catastrophe -- has drained all the color from it and made it a pitiful wasteland.  It's more than I can bear, I tell you!  I pray that we can restore it somehow, but I just... can't see an end in sight anywhere.  Our fight can't be in vain!\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Cowardly Lion</b> groans from beside Ozma, looking more shaken up than usual.  \"A king, they call me.  King of the beasts.  And what good has that been?  Beasts have been attacking us as if I weren't their king at all, and even if they weren't, I can hardly protect any beasts from the Colour.  What sort of king can't even protect his own people?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Hungry Tiger</b> scowls, more energetic than many of your companions but still visibly upset.  \"I cannot have lost my appetite!  I grant you that the creatures we have fought in recent days have been wholly unappealing, but that should not make me uninterested in eating!  Surely the Colour is to blame for this.  Robbing me of my hunger!  If we do not destroy it, then my appetite may never return and I would wither away before your eyes!\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Sawhorse</b> races suddenly past you, then stops and plods glumly back toward you.  \"Friend human, do you think that I am slowing?  My wood does not feel as sturdy as it was, but it does not feel rotten.  Just wrong somehow.  The Colour has surely done something to me, but I do not know if it can be fixed.  I would not worry if there were still good trees left in Oz to replace the bad wood, but I do not think there are.  Perhaps the royal smiths can shod my whole body in gold, but then I would be very slow indeed.  It still may be better to be slow than rotted away.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "The mood is understandably low, for your forays against the Colour have gained you some knowledge and preparation, but done little to physically stop the spreading.  There is much to be done, and now you are as ready as you will ever be."

"Ozma calls the assembly to order and stands, looking fatigued, but proud as she possibly can.  \"My friends, you have fought well these past days.  Thanks to your efforts, we have built hope of success.  Your observations and victories have shown us that the Colour's infection of Oz is only the symptom.  It is all an extension of the true threat -- the heart of the Colour that arrived on the meteorite.  We can fight the Colour forever, but metaphorically, we are only trimming the weeds while its roots are still strong.\"\n"
"Glinda stands beside Ozma with a grim nod.  \"When we first encountered the meteorite, we could not have destroyed it because we lacked the knowledge and means.  We now have them, but the meteorite of course disappeared when Ruggedo first touched it.  There was no way to predict what could have happened, but the invasion of the Nomes confirms that the meteorite is still with him, deep underground in the Nome Kingdom.  Many of us have visited the Nome Kingdom in our past adventures, and we must journey there once again to find and destroy the source of the Colour.  The tunnel that the invaders used to enter Oz shall now be our path back to their domain.  Let us prepare at once!\""
