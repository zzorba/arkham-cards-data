"The white plume left by the meteor's descent guides the expedition steadily but warily forward.  By mid-morning, land rises above the horizon into view, and by noon, strange lights are clearly visible in midair some distance in from the shore.  With the strong possibility of immediate contact with the Colour, you and your closest allies are elected to go ashore first to gauge the danger.  To make matters worse, you must venture onto an island that shouldn't exist.  There's no telling if anyone -- or anything -- inhabits it, nor how hostile they might be.\n"
"After your preparations are finished and a small show made of wishing you good luck, you set out for the shore.  A temperate forest crowds most of the shoreline, but the shifting glow of the colored lights shines through.  Even without the strange aura, there is something about the island that doesn't quite fit into the world that you know.  The scenery is as lush and bright as a fairy tale picture.  For about half an hour, you journey inland until you come to a wide clearing, and a very unexpected sight.\n"
"Amid the open field and surrounded by neatly tended hedges stands a city made entirely of glass.  Each building shifts in color, lit from above by the slowly changing lights.  You can see unobstructed by the forest now that there are six multicolored orbs beaming brightly down on the landscape, coloring it as the beams cycle.  You're not certain whether this display is linked to the Colour or not, but a stranger spectacle presents itself a bit closer to the ground.\n"
"People begin to emerge from the glass city, moving slowly and elegantly, but there is something unnatural about their appearance.  Though definitely human-like and beautiful to behold, there are no traces of emotion on their faces at all.  Stranger still, several of the citizens step off of buildings, striding through the air as easily as if they were on land.  A royal-looking woman with a star on her forehead approaches you ahead of the others and extends her finger as if in accusation.\n"
"\"You arrive following the rain of rocks that the sorcerer foretold.  Do you deny that it is the cause of your arrival?\"  Not a promising start for first contact.  You try to explain that the meteor fell on its own and that you are merely trying to locate it, but the woman simply stares at you with the same blank expression.  \"That may be.  The sorcerer will determine whether or not you speak the truth.  Come with us, if you wish to prove that you do not lie.\""

msgid "Ruefully, you retreat back to the shore and row the boat back to the larger ship.  The scientists keep their distance given your exposure, but still assault you with questions about specifics you couldn't possibly have taken.  You insist that you return to the island by another way, and the crew allows you to make use of a seaplane brought along for emergencies.  If this isn't an emergency, then nothing is.  You and your immediate companions re-equip yourselves and start the seaplane to head back into the island."

msgid "Your rickety contraption nearly falters, but the attached wings begin to flap of their own accord, carrying the glider higher and higher.  The gargoyles pursue in their silent anger, but as soon as your glider clears the wooden mountains surrounding their domain, they sullenly give up the chase.  With confidence building, you trust your glider to keep up its flight and look to the horizon, descending past the clouds that first shrouded your way up to the gargoyle lands."

"Finally beyond the difficult path you first took on the island, your flight carries you over a vast and empty desert.  It astonishes you that so much more of the island lies beyond the first hurdle.  How could such an enormous land mass lie undiscovered by the outside world for so long?  One could walk for days and still be lost in the barren sands.\n"
"As the land rushes beneath you, a vibrant color suddenly blooms into view.  You tighten your grip on the controls, ready to take evasive action, but soon see that the Colour is not the cause.  Ahead of you, the desert abruptly meets rock, and a lush forest grows beyond it, but not a normal one by any means.  Each tree, shrub, and blade of grass is tinted a bright red color, as if simply painted on.  You temper your wonder with the task at hand, scanning the forest for landmarks as you fly out over it.\n"
"The moment you cross the border between the desert and the forest, your craft shudders violently.  Alarmed, you turn your attention to the wings and find that the moving parts have somehow locked up completely.  You lean and pull tensely, trying to coax the last bits of lift out of your inert flier.  Without power, you can only glide forward and hope that you have enough altitude to clear the impending tree tops.\n"
"Within inches of the treeline, your flight path suddenly bursts into open space, where the red field thins out and slowly merges with a bright green one.  Further in other directions you spot similar forests in vibrant yellow, blue, and purple, but a far greater sight catches your immediate attention.  In the center of the green field, a city with tall walls and taller spires stands proudly.  Like the field around it, the city is a rich shade of green, made more glittering by the bright gemstones embedded in the city walls.  Truly, this emerald city looks more like a single great palace for all its opulence.\n"
"Your craft bows downward more by the second, but with great effort, you are able to turn the blunt crash into a rough coasting to the end.  You skid to a stop in the soft green sod, splintering one of the wings entirely, but managing to keep the rest of the plane -- and its occupants -- alive and well.  You breathe a thankful sigh and start to pick yourself up out of the wreck, when a soldier with bright green whiskers and an equally green uniform rushes up.  He levels an old blunderbuss at you, gauging you with a worried look on his face.  \"Speak up now!  How and why have you come to Oz?\""
