msgstr "幕间故事I：不眠之夜"

msgid "In order, read each of the following sections:"
msgstr "按顺序阅读以下段落："

msgid "Check your supplies to see which investigators have a blanket."
msgstr "查看你们的补给品，检查那些调查员带有毛毯。"

msgid "Restful Sleep"
msgstr "安稳入睡"

msgid "Tossing and Turning"
msgstr "辗转反侧"

msgid "Those nights in the jungle, I barely slept. A strange fog rolled through the camp each night, plunging the area in an intense and peculiar cold. My bedroll offered some protection against the elements, but we hadn’t been prepared for this unnatural weather. Flies and mosquitoes buzzed in my ears every time I began to drift off. Even when I finally slept, I would soon be startled awake by the crawling of an insect or lizard across my face. I wager I’ll get very little sleep on this journey…"
msgstr "在丛林度过的每个夜晚，我都几乎没睡著过。一团古怪的雾气每晚垄罩著营地，使这片区域陷入诡异的严寒。我的睡袋多少可以抵挡些严寒，但我们并未作准备对应这异常的气候。每当我将要入睡时，苍蝇和蚊子就在我的耳朵里嗡嗡作响。就算我睡著了，也很快会因为昆虫或蜥蜴在脸上爬来爬去而吓醒。我敢打赌，我在这趟旅程中睡不了多少时间……"

msgid "Mercifully, I was able to sleep through each night. However, while my body rested, my mind was plagued by nightmares. A cavern like a gaping maw, bathed in dim red light…the walls slithering with the glimmering scales of a hundred vipers…it might have been better had I not slept at all."
msgstr "幸好，我每晚还能入睡。但是，在我的身体得到休息的同时，精神却受著梦魇的折磨。我梦到身在昏暗的红光之中，有一处血盆大口一般的洞穴……上百条毒蛇的鳞片在洞壁上闪烁著微光……我情愿自己没睡著。"

msgid "Check your supplies. The investigators, as a group, must cross off one provisions per investigator from their supplies. For each provisions they cannot cross off, choose an investigator to read <b>Low on Rations</b>."
msgstr "查看你们的补给品。调查员以团队为单位，必须从补给品中划掉配给，划掉的数量等于调查员人数。调查员每少划掉一个配给，选择一位调查员来阅读<b>配给不足</b>。"

msgid "We thought we’d brought enough food and water for everybody, but the journey had taken its toll on our supplies. When the sun rose and it came time to eat, we discovered we were already running out of provisions."
msgstr "我们原以为带的食物和水足够我们所有人享用，但这趟旅程耗尽了我们的物资。当太阳升起，到了进食的时间，我们发现自己的食物和水都已耗尽。"

msgid "The lead investigator must choose one investigator to be the group’s lookout. Then, that investigator checks their supplies to see if they have binoculars."
msgstr "调查员队长必须选择一位调查员来为队伍放哨。然后，该调查员查看自己的补给品之中是否带有双筒望远镜。"

msgid "(has binoculars)"

msgid "Group's lookout"
msgstr "团队的放哨者"

msgid "Shapes in the Trees"
msgstr "树林中的身影"

msgid "Eyes in the Dark"
msgstr "黑暗中的眼睛"

msgid "Each night, I was watched. I didn’t just feel watched: I saw the eyes peering out from the inky darkness that surrounded our camp. They knew we were there. The yellow eyes watched me, alert, my weapons drawn, ready to defend the camp if the need arose. Our eyes met, and a darkness seized my heart."
msgstr "每一个夜晚，我都受到监视。这并不是我的错觉：我看见在营地的周围，有许多双眼睛从漆黑之中投来视线。它们知道我们在那里。那些黄色的眼睛紧盯著我，我心生警惕，拔出自己的武器来准备保卫营地。就在目光相接之时，一片黑暗攫噬了我的心灵。"

msgid "Most of the nights passed without incident, but on this night, I was startled by the rustling of tree branches along the southern border of our camp’s clearing. Despite the darkness, I was able to use my binoculars to see shapes moving in the trees. The shapes appeared human, but…why? Why do they only watch us from afar? What is their purpose?"
msgstr "大多数夜晚都无惊无险地度过了，但今晚，营地空地的南边传来枝叶的沙沙声，把我吓了一跳。尽管身处黑夜，我还是能用双筒望远镜看到树林中移动的身影。那些身影看起来像人类，但……为什么？他们为什么要从远处监视我们，他们有何目的？"

msgid "You earn 2 additional experience as you gain further insight into the motivations of the Eztli."
msgstr "你进一步了解埃兹特里人的动机，获得2点额外的经验点数。"

msgid "As the days went by, the poison continued to spread through my body. By the second night, my skin was drenched in sweat. I started having difficutly breathing, and I began every morning by retching up most of the previous night’s dinner."
msgstr "随著时间的流逝，毒性在我的体内持续扩散。到了第二晚，汗水浸湿了我的皮肤。我呼吸变得十分困难，每天早晨起来，我几乎都要将前一晚的晚餐吐出来。"
