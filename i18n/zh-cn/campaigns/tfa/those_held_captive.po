msgid "You turn your attention to your surroundings. Though the creatures that ambushed you are nowhere to be found, Alejandro lies on the ground nearby, stirring into consciousness. To your surprise, he appears just as confused as you are. At first, it seems as though he recalls nothing of the previous expedition or the Eztli relic, but then his eyes suddenly spark with recognition. He grips your shoulder tightly and gazes at you as though for the first time in years. “I do remember! We shared one mind for some time, the creature and I. It wished to find the Eztli relic, though for what purpose, I do not know.” He slumps backward against the stone wall, recovering from the sudden influx of memories. “You believed me at every turn, even when the creature had control. You saved me from that abysmal place and brought me back to humanity. For this, I cannot begin to repay you.” He shakes your hand vigorously, filled with a sudden and intense resolve. “We will right all of this, you and I. Then, we will tell the world what we have seen.”"
msgstr "你注意周遭的环境。尽管伏击你的生物已不知所踪，亚历山卓就躺在附近的地面上，他摇晃著自己的脑袋以恢复意识。令你惊讶的是，他跟你一样感到困惑。他一开始似乎完全想不起上一次探险和埃兹特里遗物，但随后他双眼灵光一闪，想了起来。他紧紧抓著你的肩膀，目不转晴地盯著你，仿佛是多年后的初次对视。“我记起来了！我和那头生物曾在一段时间里共享意识。它想找到那个埃兹特里遗物，但它出于什么目的，我就不知道了。”记忆突然涌入脑海，他向后退去，贴著石壁瘫坐在地面，“你每次都信任我，即使是那头生物控制著我的时候也是。你把我从那个深不见底的地方救了出来，还将我带回人世。此等恩情，我无以为报。”他激动地握著你的手，心中突然决心笃定，“我们将会把这一切拨乱反正，就我和你。然后，我们再把自己的所见公诸于世。”"

msgid "The narrow steps on the other side of the stone doorway seem almost endless. Though a dim red glow emanates from deeper within the cavern, no matter how many steps you traverse, the glow does not brighten. It almost seems to grow more distant with each step, mocking your tenacity. After a short while, you come to a small ledge where a stone gate bars your passage deeper into the cavern. The gate bears a familiar carved pattern, faded from age and disrepair, and seeping with an oddly discolored purulence."
msgstr "在石门的另一边有著狭窄的阶梯，几乎看不到尽头。尽管洞穴深处发出一抹昏暗的红色光芒，但是不管你走了多少步，光芒也没有变得明亮一些。似乎每走一步，距离就变得更加遥远，仿佛在嘲笑著你的执著。过了一阵，你来到一处窄小的平台，面前有一扇石门阻挡著你继续深入洞穴。这扇门有著熟悉的雕刻纹样，被岁月磨蚀，几不可见，还流著怪异的变色脓浆。"

msgid "The situation sparks your memory, and you consult the expedition journal. The pattern is similar to one found in the Eztli ruins. Using your chalk and the drawings in your journal as a reference, you restore the glyph in its entirety, and the grooves glow brightly once more. The stone gate lifts on its own, and you are able to continue onward."
msgstr "当下的情况勾起了你的回忆，于是你翻阅探险日志。这个纹样与在埃兹特里遗迹找到的一个纹样相近。用上粉笔，再加日志上的图画作参考，你重新排列出完整的字符，随后凹槽再次发出了明亮的光芒。石门自动开启，你可以继续前进了。"

msgid "You are unsure how to proceed. After debating the merits of each of your options, you decide that brute force may be the only solution. It takes all of your strength to lift the stone, and you open the way forward for each of you one at a time. It is no simple task, and your body aches tremendously from the effort."
msgstr "你不知道如何前进。在权衡各个方案的优点之后，你认为使用蛮力可能是唯一的解决办法。你用尽全力来推动这块石头，开启了前进的道路，每个人依次通过。这不是一件易事，你的身体在劳累过后疼痛不已。"

msgid "When drawing opening hands during the next scenario, investigators cannot take a mulligan."
msgstr "下一场冒险期间，在抽取起始手牌时，调查员不能进行换牌。"

msgid "Hours later, you are almost too weary to go on. Every inch of your body aches with intense pain. There is nothing in this desolate cavern to eat but the occasional wild mushroom, and although temptation gnaws at your insides, you cannot tell which are toxic and which are healthy…"
msgstr "几个小时之后，你疲倦不堪，无法继续前进。你身体的每一寸都剧痛不已。这个荒凉的洞穴里没有食物，只有不时发现的一些野生蘑菇，仿佛引诱著你将它吃下，但你不知道哪些蘑菇有毒，而哪些无毒……"

msgid "The poison has spread to nearly every part of your body. Your skin pales, and you are covered in cold feverish sweat. Simply rising to your feet requires a tremendous effort, and you get no rest at night despite your exhaustion. It won’t be long now before the poison claims your life."
msgstr "毒性几乎传遍了你身体的每一部位。你的皮肤变得苍白，发热产生的冷汗浸湿你全身。只是站起身就要耗费巨大的力气，而即使你筋疲力尽，你仍然无法在夜间入睡。过不了多久，毒性就会要了你的命。"

msgid "After descending hundreds and hundreds of steps, you decide to stop and rest. Though your watch tells you that night has fallen, the lack of natural sky is starting to affect your internal clock. With no flat ledge in sight, each member of your party claims one of the many narrow steps to sleep on."
msgstr "在向下走了数百级台阶之后，你决定停下来休息。尽管你的手表显示此时已是夜晚，但见不到本来的天空，使得你生物钟开始受到影响。周围看不到任何平地，你队伍中的每个成员各自占据了几格狭窄的台阶，用来睡觉。"

msgid "Sleep does not come easily for you. Barely any layers protect you from the bitter cold of the underground cavern, and you lie shivering for hours before exhaustion finally claims you. You awaken every hour or so as the shifting of your body almost causes you to tumble off your stone perch. When “morning” comes, you are even more weary than you were the previous night."
msgstr "你没法轻松入睡。几乎没有任何遮盖物能够让你免受这地下洞穴的严寒，你躺著瑟瑟发抖，直到精疲力竭。你每个小时都会醒来，而每次醒来时你的身体只要稍作移动，都会让你滚下石阶。在“早晨”到来时，你比前一晚还更加疲倦。"

msgid "Though you long for a proper bed, at least your blanket protects you from the frigid chill that permeates the cavern. When “morning” arrives, your body longs for more sleep, but you know you must press onward and reach the Nexus as fast as you can…"
msgstr "尽管你渴望一张合适的床，但至少你的毛毯使你不受洞穴内弥漫的寒意所侵袭。在“早晨”到来时，你的身体渴望著继续休息，但你知道你必须继续前进，尽快到达联结点。"
