"It’s been a hell of a day. We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.\n"
"The dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.\n"
"Already one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds."

"今天真是糟透了。我们刚刚才在丛林南部边境扎好营，这儿就是亚历山卓深信埃兹特里曾经存在的地方。这片丛林生长茂密，充满野性。树冠遮盖了天空，但从这清爽的微风看来，我敢肯定头上正积聚著乌云。\n"
"我们曾多次被告知本次探险的危险性。这里远离文明的迹象已有几百英里，当代还没人踏入过这片狂野之地的腹地。直至现在，也没有人有理由去作这一尝试。毕竟，墨西哥的这个区域根本不应该存在阿兹特克遗迹。但现在我们到此寻找遗迹，尽管大家都说它不可能存在于此。\n"
"我们的一位测量员已疾病缠身，而另一位则被毒蛇咬伤。我不禁觉得，丛林不希望我们在此出现。要是运气一直这么糟，我们这次探险恐怕要成米斯卡塔尼克大学史上最短的探险了。今晚我们先作休整，明天便要步入这片神秘的野地探险了。"

"I still have no idea how we made it back to camp alive.\n"
"The jungle was more perilous than we could have possibly imagined. This may read like the ravings of a lunatic, but I cannot explain it any other way. Being lost in the jungle was no picnic, but that was the least of our worries. The rainforest was guarded. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger and hate, hunting us relentlessly.\n"
"Perhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. I thought Alejandro would be excited to learn more about them, but he was more disturbed than fascinated. I suppose he has a right to be incredulous. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\n"
"The serpent creatures chased us for what seemed like days. Finally we were able to find our way back to camp, but the price was steep. We had lost all progress we had made, and many of us were injured or afflicted by serpent venom. We have no choice but to send runners to the nearest city for additional supplies and to wait and recover from our wounds."

"我完全不知道我是怎么活著回到营地的。\n"
"丛林的险恶远远超出我们的想像。这听起来就像疯子的胡话，但我没法以别的方式解释这件事。我们在丛林里迷了路，大费周章才回到正途，但与别的事相比，迷路根本算不上什么。丛林“有人看守”，看守者是深不可测的恐怖存在：这些蛇人被愤怒和仇恨所驱使，无情地追捕我们。\n"
"或许跟它们一样可怕的，还有丛林中的原住民。从衣著和谈吐来看，他们像是阿兹特克的战士。阿兹特克人早在数百年前便被征服，但这些战士们却不知何故存活至今。他们为什么几个世纪都没被发现？我们实在想不到答案。我本以为亚历山卓准会为此兴奋不已，想要更加了解他们。然而他实际上却十分不安，一洗先前那副陶醉的神情。毕竟这次探险尽是些不合常理的怪事，他确实有理由怀疑。\n"
"一群蛇人大概追了我们好几天，最终我们找到了返回营地的路，但付出的代价十分惨痛。探险至今为止的进展全都化为泡影，队伍里的好些成员都受了伤，或受蛇毒折磨。我们别无选择，只能派几个人跑到最近的城市再去拿些补给品，等伤员恢复。"

"Somehow, after much toil and many hours of exploration, we found the ruins that Alejandro sought, though we scarcely could have been ready for what we encountered in the wilds of the jungle. The rainforest was guarded. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger and hate. They hunted us relentlessly, wielding primitive weaponry and communicating in sharp hisses.\n"
"Perhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. The warrior named Ichtaca was particularly intriguing. We were able to defuse the initial encounter with her, and surprisingly, she helped guide us through the jungle, only to disappear mysteriously when we reached the ruins. I have a feeling we have not seen the last of her.\n"
"Alejandro did not agree with our decision to trust the Eztli warriors. He’s decided to stay at camp until further notice, disturbed as he is by their presence. I thought he would be excited to learn more about them, but I expect this discovery defies even his broad-minded theories. I suppose he has a right to be distrustful. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\n"
"We have cleared a route to what Alejandro believes is the main temple of the ruins. There is little time to rest. The serpent creatures seem intent on stopping us, so we cannot tarry any longer than necessary. Soon we will enter the ruins to see what secrets they hide."

"不知怎地，在历尽艰辛和数小时的探索之后，我们找到了亚历山卓苦苦找寻的遗迹，尽管我们未曾想在这片荒野丛林之中有此遭遇。丛林“有人看守”，看守者是深不可测的恐怖存在：被愤怒和仇恨所驱使的蛇人。它们无情地追赶我们，运用原始的武器，以嘶嘶的叫声互相交流。\n"
"或许跟它们一样可怕的，还有丛林中的原住民。从衣著和谈吐来看，他们像是阿兹特克的战士。阿兹特克人早在数百年前便被征服，但这些战士们却不知何故存活至今。他们为什么几个世纪都没被发现？我们实在想不到答案。那个名叫伊塔卡的战士尤其神秘。我们在初次遭遇她时成功解除了她的敌意，令人吃惊的是她指引我们通过了丛林。但当我们到达遗迹时，她却神秘地消失了。我有种感觉，我们还会再次见到她。\n"
"我们提议相信埃兹特里的战士们，而亚历山卓对此并不赞同。他决定留在营地等待进一步消息，战士们在场使他烦恼焦躁。我本以为他准会兴奋地想要更加了解他们，但我猜想这一发现甚至与他博大精深的理论相悖。毕竟这次探险尽是些不合常理的怪事，他确实有理由怀疑。\n"
"我们清出了一条道路，通向亚历山卓相信遗迹主神庙所在的地方。一群蛇形生物似乎要阻止我们进入此地，因此我们一刻也不能耽搁，几乎没时间休整队伍。很快我们就会进入遗迹，看看它们到底藏著什么秘密。"
