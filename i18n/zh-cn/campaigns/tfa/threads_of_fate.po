msgid "The night passes with Ichtaca resting in your living room. You get no sleep for the remainder of the night, your thoughts drifting between concern and disbelief. Her story is preposterous, but you feel compelled to believe it nonetheless. You’ve known that the relic from the Eztli ruins had some deeper purpose ever since you first laid eyes on it. When you emerge from your bedroom the next morning, your uninvited guest is sitting at your dining-room table, arms crossed tightly across her chest. Her piercing eyes trace your every move like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged. “Where is the relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain that it is safe, in good hands. She shakes her head, her knuckles white with frustration. “I assure you it is not.”"
msgstr "伊塔卡在你的客厅里休息过夜。你整晚都睡不著，思绪在担忧和怀疑之间游移不定。她所说的匪夷所思，但尽管如此，你认为自己必须相信她说的话。自从你见到埃兹特里遗物的第一眼开始，你就知道它有著某种更深层的意义。第二天早上，当你从自己的卧室走出来时，那位不速之客就坐在你的餐桌旁边，双手紧紧地在胸前交叉。你每走一步，她锐利的目光都紧紧跟随。就像鸟儿在监视著自己的猎物。你二人不互致寒暄，直奔主题。“那件遗物现在在哪？”伊塔卡焦躁地问道，“你把它带到哪里去了？”你解释说遗物现在很安全，由正派的人士保管。她失望地摇了摇头，手指的关节攥得发白：“我很确定地告诉你，它现在一点也不安全。”"

"Setting aside your many questions for the time being, you call your contact at the Miskatonic University Museum. Despite the early hour, Dr. Horowitz should be at her office preparing for the long day ahead of her. The operator connects you after a short delay. Elli gives you an unusually curt greeting, her voice cracking and unsteady. As soon as you ask about the relic, she scoffs. “Not you, too! Mr. Walsted is practically knocking down my office door, and two reporters have been harrassing me all morning!”\n"
"You ask her what the trouble is, and she lets out a long sigh. “The relic is missing,” she explains. “None of the security guards knows what happened. One minute it was in its display case; the next it was gone. And before you ask, no, Mr. Vela is nowhere to be found.” Suddenly she is yelling to another party, “One moment please! I am on the telephone!” She apologizes to you tersely and hangs up a moment later.\n"
"Sure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time. Find the relic and meet me back here tonight. Don’t follow me.”"

"你将心中的困惑暂且搁置，给自己在米斯卡塔尼克大学博物馆的联络人打了个电话。尽管时间还早，霍洛维兹博士应该已经在她的办公室里，为即将到来的漫长一天作准备。过了一会，接线员接通了你的电话。爱丽向你致以异常简短的问候，她的声音沙哑而颤抖。当你问起那件遗物的时候，她哂笑道：“你也来问这件事！沃思提几乎要把我办公室的门给拆了，还有两个记者从一早就在缠著我！”\n"
"你问她遇到了什么麻烦事，而她长叹了一口气。“遗物不见了，”她解释道，“保安没有一个人知道它是怎么丢的。上一分钟它还待在展览柜里；而下一分钟它就不见了。你是不是想问维拉在哪，他不见了，哪都找不到他的踪影。”她突然对别人叫道，“请再等一会儿！我正在打电话！”她简短地对你表示歉意，下一刻便挂了电话。\n"
"果然，亚历山卓没有接电话，而从昨天开始，其他同事就没人见过他了。“现在你相信我了吗？”伊塔卡站起来收拾她的东西，向你发问，“我们不能再这么浪费时间。去找遗物，然后今晚回到这儿跟我碰面，不要跟著我。”"

"Setting aside your many questions for the time being, you call Harlan’s office at the university. Though the sun is barely peeking over the horizon, you’ve always known him to be an early riser. The operator connects you after a short delay. Harlan’s voice is shaky and rough.\n"
"He cuts you off as soon as you ask about the relic. “Don’t!” he barks. “They’re listening. They know I am keeping it here. They have already taken Alejandro.” You try to calm him down so you can ask him what he means, but he cuts the conversation short. “I have to go. They are here!—” The line goes dead.\n"
"Sure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time. Find the relic and meet me back here tonight. <i>Don’t</i> follow me.”"

"Ichtaca grits her teeth and pauses. You expect her to refuse and leave without answering your questions, but surprisingly, she relents. According to Ichtaca, her people have spent ages protecting the relic from interlopers who would use it for nefarious purposes. She speaks cryptically, in half-riddles and tall tales, although she refuses to explain where her people come from and how they have remained hidden for so long. When pressed about the relic, all she says is that it controls the flow of time, and that it must not be tampered with.\n"
"“It must return to its rightful place,” she explains. Her gaze is relentless, unwavering. “Do you understand? It cannot fall into the wrong hands. If you help me recover it, I will aid you in return. Just promise me you will not use it.”"

"伊塔卡牙关紧咬，停下了动作。你本以为她会拒绝你，直接离开并且不回答你的问题，但令你惊讶的是，她的态度变得缓和。伊塔卡说，她的同胞经历了多个时代，保护遗物不落入心怀鬼胎的入侵者手中。她的话神秘兮兮，参杂著谜一般的语言和荒诞不经的故事，不过她拒绝解释她的同胞是从哪里来的、他们又是怎么存活至今而不被发现的。当问到遗物时，她只说它能控制时间流，而且它绝对不能被篡改。\n"
