msgid "You descend down miles of steep, cold stone. The tunnels are chokingly narrow at first, filled with rubble and detritus. Finally, you reach level ground, and the cavern’s true nature reveals itself before you. It is as though there were an entire world below the surface; the cavern’s ceiling is like a stone curtain of sky above you. Even more vast and terrifying are the endless depths below you, beyond the edges of stone chasms and archaic bridges. On all sides, this underground realm seems to extend beyond the boundary of your sight; you wonder just how far it reaches. Perhaps the entirety of the known surface of the Earth is but the top layer of another world…"
msgstr "你沿著陡峭而冰冷的石块一路下行了好几英里。隧道一开始窄得令人窒息，满是碎石。最后，你到达了一个平层，在你面前是这座洞穴的真实面貌。地面以下彷佛曾经有著一个完整的世界；洞顶就像悬在你头顶的石质天穹。在这条岩石裂缝和古老桥梁的彼端，你下方的无尽深渊广无边际，令人生怖。这个地下领域像是向四面八方延伸到你视线以外；你想知道它到底到达了多远的地方。或许地球上已知的整个地表，不过是另一个世界的顶层……"

msgid "Put the Mouth of K’n-yan into play, <i>(The Depths Beneath)</i> side faceup. Each investigator begins play at the Mouth of K’n-yan <i>(The Depths Beneath)</i>."
msgstr "将昆扬之口放置入场，<i>(下有深渊)</i>面朝上。每位调查员从昆扬之口<i>(下有深渊)</i>开始游戏。"

msgstr "将深入幽嘶地点放在一边，位于场外。"

msgid "Create the exploration deck. This is done by taking the 5 remaining single-sided locations from the <i>K’n-yan</i> encounter set and shuffling them together, along with 1 copy each of the following encounter cards: Pitfall, No Turning Back, Deep Dark, and Final Mistake."
msgstr "构建探索牌堆。拿取<i>昆扬</i>遭遇组剩余的5张单面地点，将这些地点与遭遇卡一同混洗形成探索牌堆，所混洗的遭遇卡为以下每种1张：落入陷阱、无路可退、一片漆黑、致命错误。"

msgid "You awaken, lying on rough stone in a place much colder and deeper than before. You stand and take stock of your surroundings, noting the red glow that seems to emanate from the cavern to your left. You follow it for several minutes, until finally it leads you into a well-lit entryway, filled with stone pillars. At the far end of the room lies an ornate and elaborately decorated doorway, a stone disc that has been rolled aside to unveil the hellish realm beyond."
msgstr "你苏醒过来，发现自己处在一个更加寒冷、更深入的地方，躺在一块粗糙的石块上。你站起身来，环视周围环境，注意到一抹红光，它似乎是从你离开的洞穴发出的。你跟著光芒走了好几分钟，最后在其引领下来到一个亮堂的门廊，其中布满了石柱。在这间石室遥远的后方，有著一扇华丽而精致的大门，一块石盘被滚到了一旁，开启彼端如炼狱般的领域。"

msgid "“Finally! Yoth, cavern of the serpents! The cursed ones, who fled the destruction of Valusia!” Alejandro examines the entryway with wonder in his eyes, arms raised in exultation. You know not of what he speaks, and you are beginning to grow worried. Just then, something scutters behind you, and a sound like the click-clacking of a claw catches you by surprise. Emerging from the darkness behind you are several alien creatures, the likes of which you have never seen: ten feet tall, with conical bodies that end in four strange appendages of varying lengths. “There you are,” Alejandro says calmly. One of the creatures responds by clicking its claws against one another in a deliberate pattern. “Take their minds,” Alejandro commands the creatures. “We have no further use for them.” It is your last human memory."
msgstr "“踏破铁鞋无觅处！幽嘶，万蛇之穴！从瓦卢西亚的灭顶之灾下逃离的、被诅咒的蛇族！”亚历山卓检查著大门，双眼流露出惊奇的神色，兴奋地举起双臂。你听不懂他在说些什么，但你开始有点担心。就在刚才，你身后传来急奔的脚步声，还有一阵咔㗳咔㗳的声音，彷佛你会突然被一支巨钳抓住。几个怪异的生物从你身后的黑暗中现身，你从未见过类似的生物：它们高逾十英呎，有著锥状的身体，躯干末尾还有著四根长短不一的奇异附肢。“你们来了。”亚历山卓平静地说道。其中一个生物以一种刻意的方式击打著自己的两个钳子，作为应答。“夺走他们的意识。”亚历山卓指挥这些生物，“我们已经不需要他们了。”这是你作为人类最后的记忆。"

msgid "Before you are able to cross into the next layer of the cavern, a sound like the click-clacking of a claw catches you by surprise. Emerging from the darkness behind you are several alien creatures, the likes of which you have never seen: ten feet tall, with conical bodies that end in four strange appendages of varying lengths. You are stunned to see a human figure standing at the head of the group: none other than Alejandro Vela. “Take their minds,” Alejandro commands the creatures. “We have no further use for them.” It is your last human memory."
msgstr "直到你进入洞穴的下一层之前，一阵咔㗳咔㗳的声音跟随著你，彷佛你会突然被一支巨钳抓住。几个怪异的生物从你身后的黑暗中现身，你从未见过类似的生物：它们高逾十英呎，有著锥状的身体，躯干末尾还有著四根长短不一的奇异附肢。当你看见这群生物的人类首领时，你十分震惊：那人正是亚历山卓·维拉。“夺走他们的意识。”亚历山卓指挥这些生物，“我们已经不需要他们了。”这是你作为人类最后的记忆。"
