"It has been several days since your party ventured forth into the rainforest once more, and each day, the hazards you face grow more dangerous and frequent. Securing enough food and supplies for the journey is a constant struggle, and you are harrassed at every turn by the jungle’s inhabitants. Fortunately, you have seen no sign yet of the serpent people who attacked the previous expedition, but you’re positive they are out there. Watching. Waiting.\n"
"On the morning of the sixth day, you find the entrance. It is a huge cave opening, partially obscured by trees, brush, and vines. You nearly missed the great cavern maw altogether, despite its enormity. Surrounding the cavern’s entrance are six stone pillars, each covered in strange grooves and carvings that glow with a dim red hue. Perhaps one of your guides will understand what this means?"

"自从你的队伍再次进入丛林探险以来，已经过了好几天，你们愈发频繁地遭遇危机，危险程度也与日俱增。努力保障此次旅程的食粮和补给品数量充足，这已经不容易，更别提还时常受到丛林住民的滋扰。万幸的是，你至今还没发现上次探险来袭的蛇族的踪迹，但你确定它们就在那里。它们在盯著你们，伺机而动。\n"
"在第六天的早晨，你找到了入口。这是一个巨大的洞穴入口，被树木、灌木丛和藤蔓遮挡著。你差点完全错过了这整个巨大的洞穴入口，尽管它是如此地庞大。洞穴入口周围的是六根石柱，每根石柱均覆盖著古怪的凹槽和闪著黯淡红光的雕文。或许你的向导之中有人会知道这是什么含义？"

msgstr "<i>我们要是能对这知道多些信息就好了……</i>"

msgid "“The entrance is warded against intruders,” Ichtaca says cryptically, her eyes closed as though probing the cavern with unnatural senses. “These pillars are the key. Each is a test of wit and will.” She steps toward one of them and touches it with her palm, and its glow brightens. You notice now that the grooves along the pillar’s foundation depict a pattern you have seen somewhere before. If Ichtaca believes this place to be warded, you trust her opinion—there must be some way to break these wards…"
msgstr "“那个入口有人把守，防止入侵者进入。”伊塔卡神秘地说道，合上双眼，彷佛用灵感来探索整个洞穴一般，“这些柱子就是钥匙。每根石柱都代表著一次对智慧和意志的考验。”她向其中一根柱子踏近一步并伸出手掌触碰，柱身的光芒开始变亮。你发现这根柱子底下带有的凹槽形成一种图案，你曾在某个地方见过这图案。伊塔卡认为此地有人把守，如果你认同她的观点——必须得找到别的方法才能进去……"

msgid "Begin this scenario with Ichtaca in play."
msgstr "本场冒险开始时，将伊塔卡放置在场。"

msgid "Alejandro examines each of the pillars studiously. “It is a lock of some sort. Look here, see? The grooves do not line up perfectly.” He twists one of the pillars, and you can see the pattern along its side shifting. “I wager if we entered the cave, we would not get very far without these pillars in the correct formation. Just a hunch, I suppose…But I think we should examine this area further before we proceed.” You know Alejandro well enough by now to know that his hunches tend to be correct."
msgstr "亚历山卓仔细地查看每根石柱。 “这些柱子的作用应该和门锁差不多。看这儿，看到了吗？凹槽没有刚好连成一线。”他转动其中一根石柱，随后你看见石柱向侧转动时显示的图案。“我敢打赌，要是没有把这些石柱正确排列就进洞的话，我们是走不远的。这只是我的直觉……但我认为我们应该更加仔细地检查这个区域，再进入洞穴。”你现在很了解亚历山卓，知道他的直觉往往是对的。"

msgid "Begin this scenario with Alejandro Vela in play."
msgstr "本场冒险开始时，将亚历山卓·维拉放置在场。"

msgid "The previous expedition’s journal doesn’t have all the answers, but as you browse its pages, you are struck by a familiar diagram—one drawn by Lorenzo, an expedition member who never made it back to Arkham. It is a delicate recreation of a carving that was on the wall of one of the Eztli ruins. Many of the patterns and hieroglyphs you see in this drawing are shared among these pillars. It cannot simply be a coincidence. These pillars are surely the key to finding your way to N’kai…"
msgstr "在上一次探险的日志内并不能找到所有的答案，但当你翻动书页的时候，一个熟悉的图样吸引了你的注意力——由此前丧生的探险队员洛伦佐所绘制的一个图样。这是从其中一处埃兹特里遗迹的石壁上细致摹画的雕纹。你从摹画下来的图样忠看到了许多图案和象形文字，与这些石柱上的一致。这部是个单纯的巧合。这些石柱无疑就是关键，能够令你找到恩凯之路……"
