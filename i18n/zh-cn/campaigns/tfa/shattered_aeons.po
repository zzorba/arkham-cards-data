msgid "Scenario VIII: Shattered Aeons"
msgstr "冒险VIII：破碎永世"

msgid "The silver-blue flames that have guided you through these passages are the only vestige of hope you have remaining. One by one, the braziers lead you onward. Someone or something placed these devices here. The technology is not unlike what you have seen in the caverns of K’n-yan, or in the Eztli ruins where the relic was first found. However, it seems whoever ventured this deep below the crust of the Earth must have turned and fled, for the final brazier has been toppled and broken, and you see no more of them ahead. Thankfully, you do not need to travel in the darkness for very long. Within minutes, you come upon a huge stone doorway: no doubt the entrance to the Nexus."
msgstr "指引著你走过无数通道的银蓝色火焰，俨然已是你唯一抱有的希望。一个个火盆指引你前行。某些生物将这些设备设置在此处。这些设备的技术与你在昆扬洞穴里所见的一致，也与你初次找到遗物时所在的埃兹特里遗迹相同。但是，不管冒险深入地球内部的是谁，他肯定转身逃走了，因为最后一个火盆被推倒并且破坏，而你前方已看不见更多的火盆。庆幸的是，你不用在黑暗中久留了。几分钟之后，你面前出现一道巨大的石门：毫无疑问，这就是联结点的入口。"

msgid "Since you possess no light to guide you, you have spent every waking moment with part of your body pressed against the cavern wall, using the cold stone to navigate without losing course. As you travel, your fingers find warm, smooth grooves along the wall: the same dormant technology that existed in the Eztli ruins. You are clearly not the first to enter this abyssal place. However, whoever came here before you must have fled before their work was done, since the channels did not light to guide your way or glare with anger as you approached. Hours pass as you make your way gradually in the dark, until finally you come upon a huge stone doorway: no doubt the entrance to the Nexus."
msgstr "面前再无光亮指引你，在意识清醒的每一秒里，你尽力把自己的身体靠在雕刻的石壁上，利用这冰冷的石壁来指引方向，避免迷失。在你前行的过程中，你的手指触碰到墙体上一道温热、光滑的凹槽：与长眠于埃兹特里遗迹的技术同出一辙。你显然并非第一个闯入这个地方的人。但是，不管在你之前来到此地的人是谁，他肯定没完成任务便逃走了，因为这通道既没有光亮来指引你的方向，有没有在你到达时怒发眩光。几个小时之后，你在黑暗中逐步前行，直到你面前出现一道巨大的石门：毫无疑问，这就是联结点的入口。"

msgid "Each investigator begins this scenario with 2 fewer cards in their opening hand."
msgstr "在本场冒险开始时，每位调查员起始手牌张数减少2。"

msgid "Your hand traces over the lines carved in the doorway. An inscription. A warning to turn back, for to open this passage is to invite doom. It is too dark to recognize the language, but you know it is not one spoken by humanity in this day and age. You have no idea how you can understand the engraving. Perhaps some last remnant of memory from your time in Pnakotus, lost city of the Yithians. Or perhaps you are truly mad, discerning meaning from natural indentations in the stone wall. After all, it has been almost a week since you have seen natural light."
msgstr "你单手循著石门上雕刻的线条探索。门上有一道铭文。铭文写的是警告，让你离开，开启这条通路将会迎来毁灭。四周的黑暗使你难以辨认铭文的语言，但你知道那不同于当代人类所说的任何一种语言。你不知道你是怎么读懂这铭文的。或许是你在伊斯人失落的城市——纳克特的经历所留下的记忆。或许你是个彻头彻尾的疯子，仅凭石壁上带有的凹痕便能读懂含意。毕竟，你已经有将近一个礼拜没有见过自然界的光亮。"

msgid "The stone doorway is sealed shut when you arrive, but as soon as you approach, the artifact begins to shake and hum loudly. Grooves along the door flicker alight with a shimmering glow, and suddenly the door shifts open of its own accord. You grip the artifact tightly and enter."
msgstr "当你到达时，这扇被封印的石门紧闭著，但就在你触碰的瞬间，遗物开始震动并发出响亮的嗡嗡声。石门上的凹痕开始闪烁著微光，石门突然自动开启。你紧紧握著遗物，迈进石门。"

msgid "The stone doorway is already open when you arrive. Grooves along the door are lit with a shimmering glow. The Brotherhood must already be here. You have arrived with only moments to spare."
msgstr "在你到达时，石门早已敞开。石门上的凹痕以微弱的光芒亮了起来。兄弟会定是早就来到了这里，这时你已无暇多作准备。"

msgid "Because there are more [tablet] tokens in the chaos bag than [cultist] tokens:"
msgstr "因为混乱袋中的[tablet]标记比[cultist]标记多："

msgid "Because there are more [cultist] tokens in the chaos bag than [tablet] tokens:"
msgstr "因为混乱袋中的[cultist]标记比[tablet]标记多："

msgid "Because there are an equal number of [cultist] and [tablet] tokens in the chaos bag:"
msgstr "因为混乱袋中的[cultist]标记和[tablet]标记数量相等："

msgid "Put the Nexus of N’kai into play. Each investigator begins play in the Nexus of N’kai."
msgstr "将恩凯联结点放置入场。每位调查员从恩凯联结点开始游戏。"

msgid "Set the following 2 enemy cards out of play: Ichtaca (Scion of Yig) and Alejandro Vela (Or, Is He?)."
msgstr "将以下2张敌人卡放在一边，位于场外：伊塔卡<i>(伊格的后裔)</i>和亚历山卓·维拉<i>(或许不是他？)</i>。"

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Formless Spawn, Relic of Ages (Unleash the Timestream), A Pocket in Time, Act 4a—“Paradise Lost”, Act 4a—“Timelock”, and the 6 single- sided [[Shattered]] locations."
msgstr "将下列卡牌放在一边，位于场外：无形之子、古代遗物<i>(时光涌流)</i>、时间之窗、场景4a—“失乐园”、场景4a—“锁定时间”、6张单面[[破碎]]地点。"

msgid "Create the exploration deck. This is done by taking the 3 remaining single-sided locations and shuffling them together, along with 1 copy each of the following encounter cards: Wracked by Time, Between Worlds, and Ancient Evils."
msgstr "构建探索牌堆。拿取3张剩余的单面地点，将这些地点与遭遇卡一同混洗形成探索牌堆，所混洗的遭遇卡为以下每种1张：时空撕裂、异界之间、远古恶魔。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. For every 10 tally marks under “Yig’s Fury,” place the top card of the lead investigator’s deck in the victory display, facedown. For the remainder of the scenario, treat each of those cards as if it has Vengeance 1."
msgstr "查看冒险日志。“伊格之怒”下方每有10次纪录，将调查员队长牌堆顶的1张卡牌正面朝下放入胜利牌区。在本场冒险接下来的时间里，将这些卡牌每张视为带有<b>复仇1</b>。"

msgid "Because all investigators have been killed by the fall trauma, the investigators <b>lose</b> the campaign."

"<right><fancy>Thursday, December 17th, 1925</fancy></right>\n"
"It is difficult for me to convey my unabridged thoughts on the events that occurred during the summer of 1925. Of course, I gave my full account to Harlan—who I suspect is the only person willing to vouch for my story—but I have not sat down to record it on paper until now. Perhaps I would rather these events had been a figment of my imagination.\n"
"In truth, I have no idea how we made it out of the caverns beneath the jungle alive. Simply reaching the abyssal place was a hellish ordeal. My memory of our return trip is muddled and disarrayed. We scrambled in the dark for what seemed like ages. We were out of food, out of supplies, out of hope—but somehow, we found a way out.\n"
"Our reward for preventing calamity was scorn and ridicule. No upstanding paper or university would publish our findings, and of course we possessed no proof of our expedition save for our scars and nightmares. I wish I could say that my memory of these events has faded with each passing day, but I will never forget the alien city we explored in our conical bodies, the serpents that pursued us in red-litten Yoth, the formless abomination that lived in the depths of the Earth…\n"
"Perhaps that is why I fear making a written account of our findings—because these memories will crystallize and become etched in my mind, forever damning me to a life of terror and dismay. Still, the world needs to know what we saw. What we did."

"<right><fancy>1925年12月17日，星期四</fancy></right>\n"
"对于1925年夏天发生的种种事件，我很难把自己的想法只字不落地表达出来。当然，我将自己的经历完完整整地告诉了哈伦，因为我认为只有哈伦会愿意为我的经历佐证，但我至今还没坐下来把它记在纸上。或许我宁愿这种种事件只是出于我的想像，而非真实。\n"
"说实话，我不知道我们是怎么活著走出丛林下方的洞穴的。光是前往那个幽深的地方，就是一场地狱般的考验。我有关返程的记忆杂乱无章，浑浑噩噩。我们在黑暗中不段攀升，像是爬了多年一般。我们吃完了食物，耗尽了补给品，丧失了心中的希望——但不知为何，我们找到了出路。\n"
"我们阻止了灾难，但获得的奖赏却只有嘲笑和愚弄。所有正规的新闻社或大学都不愿出版我们的发现，而我们遍体麟伤，饱经噩梦，自然也顾不上为此次探险保留任何证据。我真希望自己关于这种种事件的记忆能随著时日消去，但我永远无法忘记我们用自己的锥形身体探索的那座怪异城市，在闪耀著红光的幽嘶里追击我们的蛇群，还有居于地球深渊的无形巨怪……\n"
"或许这就是我害怕将我们的发现记录下来的原因——因为这些记忆将会凝结，随后蚀刻在我的脑海中，毕生困扰著我，使我终日陷于恐惧和沮丧之中。但我们的所见和经历，都必须让世界知晓。"

msgid "Transposed to a different time, Valusia and the children of Yig live on. Preserved by the new timeline you have created, you and the Serpent People are safe from the events that caused their homeland’s destruction long ago, in another time. All of your past transgressions against serpent-kind are forgiven, and you are given the chance to live in the paradise-kingdom of Valusia, remade in Yig’s image. Although you may have turned your back on humanity, you take comfort in the fact that the Earth has been saved from complete ruin. Due to your actions, you are valued and respected among the Serpents and in the eyes of your new Father. Your new life is cozy and full of wonders you could never have predicted. And yet, from time to time, you look out into the wilds beyond Valusia and wonder if there is something else you could have done…"
msgstr "你传送到了另一个时空，瓦卢西亚和伊格的子嗣就居住于此。在你所创造的新时间线的保护之下，你和蛇族子民得以平安，不同于另一时空里早早覆灭的蛇族国土。你曾对抗蛇族的罪过得到了宽恕，你获得允许，能够以伊格的形貌在天堂国度瓦卢西亚居住。尽管你背弃了自己的人性，但人类已经免遭巨难，得以幸存，你的心头大石也放了下来。你的所作所为在蛇族中备受敬仰，你的新父对你青眼有加，生活舒适无比，充满你从未预料的奇迹。然而，你时不时地会望向瓦卢西亚另一端的荒野，想要知道自己是否还有什么必须要做的事情……"

msgid "Transposed to a different time, Pnakotus and the Great Race of Yith live on. Preserved by the new timeline you have created, you and the Yithians are safe from the extraterrestrials who ended their kind long ago, in another time. You are brought into the city and given freedoms other captive minds never received. Although at first, you long for your former life, the emotion fades the more time you spend in this strange new Earth. You roam the world on titan airships and delve into the collective knowledge of the Yithians, accumulated in their vast archives from centuries of research. Your studies unveil secrets that no other human will ever know. You experience technological advances that humanity would weep to discover. And you prepare for an accursed future that may still yet come to pass.."
msgstr "你传送到了另一个时空，伟大种族伊斯和纳克特就存在于此。在你所创造的新时间线的保护之下，你和伊斯人得以平安，不同于另一时空里早早毁灭于异星生命之手的伊斯文明。你被领进这座城市，获得了其他被俘的意识体并未得到的自由。尽管一开始，你渴望你的前生，但随著你在这陌生的崭新地球里度过的时日渐长，这种情绪渐渐消散。你乘坐巨大的飞艇环游世界，研习档案库中伊斯人耗费数世纪研究而成的海量知识。你的研究揭开了人类前所未知的秘密，体验了人类或会为其落泪的先进科技，而你精心准备，迎接或会降临的灾难。"

msgid "Reality as you know it will never be the same, but perhaps this is not the end of the world. After all, time is just one dimension: a dimension humanity barely understands. We experience time, but we cannot see it. We can measure it, but we cannot alter it. So what if the fourth dimension has split into hundreds of thousands of planes of existence? Our feeble human minds cannot comprehend the outcome, but the universe still survives, its ever-expanding boundaries no longer limited by the confines of time."
msgstr "你知道现世不会一成不变，但或许这不是世界末日。终究时间只是一种维度：一种人类几乎不了解的维度。我们经历时间，但却看不见它；有办法测量，但却无法改变它。所以当第四维度被切分为成千上百个位面时，会发生什么？我们人类的孱弱思维无法理解其后果，但宇宙仍然存在，其无限延伸的边界不再受时间的桎梏。"

msgid "All of this was set into motion when the Eztli ruins were first intruded upon. Ichtaca’s original warning was her last vestige of humanity speaking to you. She wanted you and the other explorers to turn back, but curiosity and greed got the better of you. Until that day, balance had been kept. Alejandro sought the relic for his own devices. Ichtaca heard the call of her master and obeyed. However, humanity is the true cause of this chaos. You know now what you must do. You know now how you can save everyone."
msgstr "所有这一切都是从埃兹特里第一次遭到入侵开始的。伊塔卡最初的警告，是她最后弥留的人性在与你对话。她想要你和其他探险者离开此地，但好奇和贪婪在你心中占了上风。在那天到来之前，一切都还保持著平衡。亚历山卓寻找遗物，是有他自己的打算。伊塔卡听从主人的呼唤而来，服从命令。而人类才是这场混乱的真正诱因。你知道自己必须要做什么了。现在你知道了拯救所有人的方法。"
