msgid "There is only one way to stop all of this from ever happening. Before you arrived and set all of these events into motion, the Eztli ruins were asleep, and the relic was relatively safe in its prison of obscurity. Had it not been for Alejandro’s desire to find it, it might have remained undiscovered for centuries. With your new understanding of the relic’s capabilities, you can return to the past and set things right. You can seal it away forever and prevent your past selves from having ever found it… even if it costs you your own life."
msgstr "要阻止这一切的发生，只有一种办法。在你到达并引起这些事件之前，埃兹特里遗迹仍在沉睡中，而遗物待在其昏暗的牢笼之中相对地安全。如果不是亚历山卓渴望找到它，它可能在经过几个世纪之后仍未被发现。因为你对遗物的能力有了新的理解，你现在能够回到过去，让一切回到正轨。你可以将这遗物永远封印，防止过去的你找到它……即便要付出生命的代价也在所不惜。"
