"You stand in front of the main temple of the Eztli, sweat pouring down your skin due to the hot, damp jungle air. Stunned, you examine your surroundings. José and Maria stand next to you, gaping in wonder at the temple’s sophisticated architecture. Their packs are bulging with the extra supplies they were able to acquire from Alejandro’s contacts in Mexico City. Alejandro himself stands at the rear of the group, grinning.\n"
"Your consciousness has been snapped so far back that your mind aches from the force of it. Your body shudders, and you struggle to resist collapsing out of exhaustion. Though you have altered fate, your true task still remains ahead of you. As the rest of the expedition sets up camp and prepares to explore the ruins, you sneak off to fulfill your purpose, leaving Alejandro and the rest of your group behind. They wouldn’t understand. They haven’t seen what you have seen."

"你站在埃兹特里主神庙前方，丛林里温热而潮湿的空气使你浑身沁满汗水。你查看周围环境时感到震惊。何塞和玛利亚就站在你旁边，惊奇地看著神庙的精妙构成。他俩的背包里装满了额外的补给品，那是通过亚历山卓在墨西哥城的人脉获得的。亚历山卓独自站在队伍后方，咧嘴而笑。\n"
"你的意识被拉回如此久远的地方，使你的大脑无力承受，痛苦不已。你的身体摇摇晃晃，竭力想要让自己站稳脚跟，避免脱力倒下。虽然你已经改写了命运，但你真正的任务仍然等待著你去完成。在其他探险队员扎营，准备探索遗迹时，你为了完成自己的目的而悄悄溜走，离开了亚历山卓和你的其他队员。他们不会理解，因为他们未曾见过你所见的事物。"

"You stand near the main temple of the Eztli, sweat pouring down your skin due to the hot, damp jungle air. Stunned, you examine your surroundings. Several tents are set up in the clearing in front of the temple. José stands guard along the border of your camp, and you can see Maria packing equipment and provisions into her backpack, getting ready for her journey to the northern edge of the jungle, as you had instructed. Alejandro sits on a log in the center of the camp, decrypting the inscription he found near the temple’s entryway.\n"

"With your failure, the paradox of clashing timelines catches up to you. Despite all you have done, the events of the future cannot be unmade. You will always find the relic. You will always fail to preserve it. And the Nexus will always falter.\n"
"Reality as you know it will never be the same, but perhaps this is not the end of the world. After all, time is just one dimension: a dimension humanity barely understands. We experience time, but we cannot see it. We can measure it, but we cannot alter it. So what if the fourth dimension has split into hundreds of thousands of planes of existence? Our feeble human minds cannot comprehend the outcome, but the universe still survives, its ever-expanding boundaries no longer limited by the confines of time."

"随著你的失败，时间线冲突的矛盾使你遭受后果。不管你做了什么，未来的种种事件都没能改写。你总能找到遗物，总是没能保护好它，而联结点定会变得衰弱。\n"
"你知道现世不会一成不变，但或许这不是世界末日。终究时间只是一种维度：一种人类几乎不了解的维度。我们经历时间，但却看不见它；有办法测量，但却无法改变它。所以当第四维度被切分为成千上百个位面时，会发生什么？我们人类的孱弱思维无法理解其后果，但宇宙仍然存在，其无限延伸的边界不再受时间的桎梏。"

"No one else has ever learned of the events that truly occurred during the summer of 1925, and no one ever will, for I intend to keep this journal locked in my safe-deposit box once I have finished writing in it. I seek only to preserve my own record of these events, for I do not wish the passage of time to erase them completely. After all, these are not my memories, but the memories of my other self: the self who ventured through time and space to save humanity.\n"
"It is difficult to explain how we did what we did. After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember. Somehow, I remember everything."

"我决定在我写完这本日志，将1925年夏天真实发生的种种事件记录完毕时，将这本日志锁在我的保险箱里，再没别人知晓，也不会有人知晓这一切。我不希望时间的流逝将这些事件通通抹去，所以只能想办法保留自己的记录。说到底，这些并不是我的记忆，而是“另一个我”的记忆：那个为了拯救人类而勇闯时空的我。\n"
"很难解释我是怎么做到那些事情的。在那一切发生之后——伊塔卡、亚历山卓、伊斯人的城市、幽嘶——人类真正的末日来得要更早，我们第一次出发寻找埃兹特里的时候便已到来。这一切的事件都是我们自己引起的。为了阻止这场灾难，我们必须将遗物永远封印起来。我清楚地记得这些事件，就像我曾亲身经历一样，尽管对我来说，这次探险的结果大不相同。我们到达了埃兹特里遗迹的中央石室，但这石室已被封印并关闭，什么东西都没法打开这道石门——即使是何塞从卡车带来的TNT炸药也不行。尽管我们带著埃兹特里曾经存在的证据回到了阿卡姆，但再也没有其他探险队能够找到埃兹特里人，或是埃兹特里遗迹。另一个我在那遗迹里死去——但我还记得他所经历的一切。不知道为什么，我一切都记得。"
