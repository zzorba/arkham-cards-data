"Our runners, José and Maria, returned several days later. They were fully stocked with food, water, aspirin, and weapons. I am curious how deep Alejandro’s connections are in Mexico. For an outcast historian, he was able to secure guns and ammunition faster than I had anticipated. But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\n"
"We ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple. Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?"

"派出去取补给品的何塞和玛利亚在几天后回来了。他们带回了满满的食物、水、阿司匹林、武器。我很好奇亚历山卓在墨西哥究竟有著多深厚的人脉关系。作为一个被学界驱逐的历史学家，他搞到枪枝和弹药的速度之快，超出了我的预期。不过，这些东西的来路，或许别人还是不知道为好。\n"
"我们再次进入丛林探险。这一次，我们做足了准备，从上次经历中汲取教训，穿过河谷，向之前不敢进入的南部更深处进发。最终我们来到了亚历山卓苦苦找寻的遗迹，马上就要进入遗迹内部，亚历山卓认为主神庙就在这里。奇怪的是，我们害怕的事情并未发生，早前遇到的蛇人并未来袭。它们逃走了吗？还是说它们只是在等待，准备在晚上我们睡下的时后发动突袭？"

"We spent most of yesterday moving our camp to the edge of the ruins. With the serpentine creatures still guarding the region, we have decided that a small party will have the best chance of slipping into the main temple unnoticed. I told Maria, the expedition’s naturalist, to take one of the trucks and wait beyond the northern edge of the rainforest. Our cartographer, José, is guarding the camp until we return. We’re on our own, but at least we’ve cleared an escape route in the event things go sour…"

"我们昨天几乎花了一整天来转移营地，在遗迹边上扎营。蛇人仍然保卫著这片区域，为了悄声无息地潜入主神庙，我们决定派出一支精锐小队。我告诉探险队中的博物学家玛利亚，要她开一辆卡车，到丛林北面的边境之外等候。我们的制图专家何塞则负责保卫营地，直到我们回来。我们只能靠自己，但以防情况变糟，我们还清出了一条逃生路线……"

"The outside of the temple ruins appeared Aztec in origin, but once we breached the interior, it became clear that these buildings had a very different and inhuman origin. The ruins were alive. The grooves in the walls were illuminated as though powered by electricity, and a faint hum of energy reverberated throughout the halls. In spite of the serpent creatures, we were able to reach a hidden passage that led deeper underground.\n"
"In the central chamber of these underground halls, we found our prize: a steel orb of unknown origin, gently humming and glowing with a dim blue light. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance, and we knew it could not have been made by the Aztecs.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, we fled the ruins. The building had started to crumble around us, as though the orb was the only thing keeping it standing. Had it been powering the ruins, like a battery? What exactly was this device that the serpents guarded so fervently?\n"
"Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the rainforest. We’re getting the hell out of this serpent-infested jungle while we still can."

"神庙遗迹外部看起来像是阿兹特克风格，但当我们进入建筑内部时，我们发现这些建筑的起源显然不同于阿兹特克，而是起源于非人种族。这些遗迹还“活”著。如同电力驱动一般，墙壁上的凹槽发出光芒，一阵低沉的能量嗡嗡声在各个厅室中回荡。尽管蛇人百般阻挠，我们还是开启了一条秘密通道，通向更深的地下。\n"
"在诸多地下厅室的中央石室里，我们找到了自己的战利品：一个发出轻微的嗡嗡声、包裹在暗淡蓝光中的神秘钢球。这个球被精心嵌入一个青铜支架里面，似乎具有宗教意义，我们认为它不可能是阿兹特克人所制。\n"
"我们带著遗物逃出了遗迹。这座建筑开始剧震，彷佛它是依靠这个球才得以维持存在的。是这个球在为遗迹供能吗，像电池一样？得到众蛇保护的这件遗物究竟是什么？\n"
"我们终于到达了丛林北部边境，玛利亚和卡车就在这等著我们。趁还来得及，我们得抓紧逃出这片蛇群出没的丛林。"

"It is not in my nature to leave a thing unfinished. For the sake of my fallen comrades, I have taken it upon myself to record the remainder of our expedition in this journal.\n"
"The others never made it out of the temple. I convinced two of the other members of the expedition, José and Andrea, to venture in after the others…But now I fear a terrible fate has befallen them, as well.\n"
"Thankfully, my gambit was worthwhile. While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\n"
"In the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device. The orb was made of an unnatural steel, attached delicately to its bronze frame. It pulsed with power in my hands and glowed with a dim blue light. Any fool could tell that it was not made by the Aztecs, but the other members of the expedition could not even begin to understand its true significance. The ruins started to crumble around me as I left, but it mattered not. The relic was all that mattered now.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, I returned to camp and told the others it was time to depart. Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. Now we are headed to Texas, where we will cross the border into the United States.\n"
"It is a shame what happened to the others. Their sacrifice will not be in vain. Now, my work can continue.\n"

"半途而废不是我的作风。为了我死去的同伴，我决定自己在这本日志上记录接下来的探险。\n"
"其他人没能活著逃出神殿。我说服了探险队的另外两名成员，何塞和安德里亚。让他们进去寻找其他人……但我担心他们也遭逢了同样的厄运。\n"
"谢天谢地，我的策略奏效了。当何塞和安德里亚搜寻他人时，我偷偷溜进神庙，沿著另一条路线走。我亲眼目睹，知道了那些事情，现在必须找到证据以作证明，才能返回大学。趁著蛇人在注意别处之际，我来到了一条秘密通道，通往更深的地下。\n"
"在诸多地下厅室的中央石室里，我找到了一件遗物。这个球体是由非天然的钢铁制成，精巧地安装在青铜支架上。它在我手中有力地搏动，发出暗淡的蓝色光芒。傻子都知道它不是阿兹特克人制造出来的，但探险队的其他队员还不了解它真正的意义。在我离开的时候，我周围的遗迹开始晃动，但这不打紧，那个遗物是现在唯一要紧的东西。\n"
"我拖著这个遗物返回了营地，让其他队员立刻撤离。我们终于到达了丛林北部边境，玛利亚和卡车就在这等著我们。现在我们得穿过边境进入美国，前往德克萨斯州。\n"
"很遗憾在别的队员身上发生了这样的事。他们不会白白牺牲的。现在，我可以继续研究了。\n"

"This was a mistake. This was all a terrible mistake. We escaped the temple with our lives, but not a moment too soon. The ruins were alive. It was as though the walls knew of our intrusion, hated us for our presence. Wanted us out. Wanted us dead.\n"

"那是个错误，那完全就是个可怕的错误。我们活著逃出了神庙，没有一秒余裕。这些遗迹还“活”著。墙壁彷佛知道我们入侵此地，对我们的存在深恶痛绝，要我们滚，要置我们于死地。\n"
"我们在神庙外集合，而何塞就在这儿等待我们。亚历山卓不希望空手而回，想要我们回到神庙里去。我们得决定接下来要做什么。"

"We made our decision. There was no way we were going back into that deathtrap. Thankfully, there was another way. José had brought some TNT from the trucks, and there was more than enough to level the damned place.\n"
"That night, we put on a hell of a fireworks show. The jungle protested. Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\n"
"José was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\n"
"Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City. Even now I do not feel safe: who could, after seeing what we have seen?\n"

"我们做出了决定。我们不能回去那座危险的建筑中。值得庆幸的是，还有另一种办法。何塞从卡车里拿出了一些TNT炸药，足够将这个该死的地方夷为平地。\n"
"当天夜里，我们简直是搞了一场烟火秀。丛林对此举十分抗拒，鸟群受惊飞向天空，地面震动不已，我们的营地周围充斥著愤恨的嚎叫。但炸药发挥了效用，将建筑炸毁。当尘埃落定，我们开始在废墟中搜，找具有历史或文化意义的东西，好像我们带回阿卡姆。\n"
"何塞最先发现了神庙残垣下发出的蓝色光芒。光芒随著时间流逝而愈发强烈。当我们开始清理碎石，以便找到光芒的来源时，突然一道闪光，遗迹中央的废墟四散开来。一个来历不明的钢球位于碎石堆顶上，发出轻微的嗡嗡声。这个球被精心嵌入一个青铜支架里面，似乎具有宗教意义。当我触碰它的时候，从这件遗物中发出了暗淡的蓝色光芒。这样的遗物不可能是阿兹特克人制造出来的。\n"
"我们拖著这个遗物逃出了遗迹，将还冒著青烟的神庙抛在身后。我们在丛林已逗留太久，我们自己也清楚地知道这一点。在我们周围，整个丛林充斥著嘶嘶声，地面上爬满了蜿蜒的蛇群。在黑暗之中，我们听到一种无法理解的语言在此起彼伏地吼叫著。没时间收拾营地了；我们得抓紧时间逃跑。安德里亚的喉咙被一根黑羽箭刺中，她惊恐的尖叫永远被扼在喉咙里，叫不出声。在我们一路向北，逃到河谷时，何塞被一条巨蟒紧紧缠住。我们还没来得及施以援手，他的脖子就被折断了。\n"
"我们终于到达了丛林北部边境，玛利亚和卡车就在这等著我们。我们到了墨西哥城之后，才停下了脚步。至今我仍没有安全感：在亲眼目睹那一切之后，我们还能重获安全感吗？\n"
"让埃兹特里和这个被遗忘的地方都见鬼去吧。"
