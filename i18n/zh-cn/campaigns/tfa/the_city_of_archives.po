"You remember very little of the next few days. Your consciousness fades in and out as your body grips with exhaustion, and your mind feebly attempts to comprehend what exactly has happened to you.\n"
"The inhabitants of this place are the same creatures you saw Alejandro consorting with: immense corrugated cones of clammy flesh, with four thick limbs extending from the top. They are horrifying to look upon, but they do not harm you as you expected they might. Your first few days are spent restrained and questioned by the creatures, several of which are somehow able to communicate in English. Others reproduce your language using an odd futuristic machine, played like a musical instrument. You are reminded strangely of the jazz piano at the Nightingale. It is only then that you realize your body has been altered. You have no hands or fingers to play the keys, no legs to walk upon, no lungs to scream out. You are one of them now, one of the creatures that has taken you captive, and your original body is nowhere to be seen.\n"
"Despite your captivity, the creatures do not seem intent on harming you. Instead, they merely interview you, asking all manner of questions about a broad range of topics: your society, your profession, your technology, your ecosystem, your human body. Their thirst for knowledge is unyielding, unending. Their questions range from the mundane to the complex. They implore you to write copiously in your own language, taking anything you write to store away in their vast archives. You are informed that you will be able to roam the city freely if you comply."

"在接下来的几天里，你都想不起多少事情。你的身体耗尽了气力，意识时有时无，你的头脑徒劳地运转，试图想明白到底发生了什么。\n"
"此地的住民与你看见的同亚历山卓在一起的生物别无二致：湿黏的肉体呈庞大锥形，布满了皱纹，从锥形顶部延伸出四根粗壮的附肢。它们看起来十分恐怖，但与你想像的相反，它们没有伤害你。一开始的几天里，你受到这些生物的监禁和质问，它们之中甚至有人能够用英语交流。而其他生物则用一个怪异的未来机器复制你的语言，它们使用那台机器的模样就像弹奏乐器一般。你莫名地想起了“夜莺”的爵士钢琴。在这时你才意识到自己的身体已经改变了。你没了能轻抚琴键的双手和十指，没了用以迈步前进的双腿，没了肺部的你甚至无法尖叫出声。你现在成了“它们”之中的一员，变成了俘肤你的生物，而你原来的身体已经无处可寻。\n"
"虽然你遭到监禁，但这些生物似乎无意伤害你。相反的是，它们仅仅是与你谈话，向你询问了各种问题，话题涉及的范园甚广：你的社会、专业、科技、生态，还有你的人类身体。它们对知识的渴求不屈不境，无休无尽，它们所提的问题由简入繁，还请求你用自己的语言写下大量文字，将你写下的所有文字存入它们庞大的档案馆中。它们告诉你，要是你服从指令，就能在这座城中自由走动。"

msgid "<i>Cooperate and tell the creatures everything you know.</i>"
msgstr "<i>协助这群生物，并将你所知道的一切都告诉它们。</i>"

msgid "<i>Refuse and resist captivity.</i>"
msgstr "<i>拒绝它们的要求，抗拒监禁。</i>"

msgid "You cooperate with the creatures, hoping to earn your freedom. You are sick of captivity, and perhaps you will be able to find a way home if you are able to roam the city at will. The creatures seem pleased that you are answering their questions, though their mannerisms are still completely alien to you. Days turn to weeks, perhaps even longer. It is difficult to tell. Finally, one of the creatures informs you that you are free to roam the halls of the city, with several restrictions: You are not allowed to do harm to your new body, for it belongs to another of their race, and you are not allowed to leave the city. Your restraints are lifted, and the creature watches with keen interest as you get used to your conical body."
msgstr "你协助这群生物，只盼能换来自由。你受够了被监禁的日子，要是你能在这座城市中自由走动，或许你能够找到回去的路。你对这群生物所提的问题一一作答，令它们十分满意，尽管你还是完全无法理解它们的怪异行为。时间过去了几个礼拜，或者更久。很难确定过去了多久。终于，其中一头生物告诉你，你能够自由地到城市的各个房间走走，但需要遵守几项限制：你不能伤害自己的新身体，因为这具身体仍属于它们的一名同胞，且你不能离开这座城。你的束缚被解开，看守著你的生物。有兴趣地看著你适应自己的锥形身体。"

msgid "the investigators cooperated with the Yithians."
msgstr "调查员协助伊斯人。"

msgid "These creatures abducted you and even stole you from your own body. You refuse to give your captors even a single answer. You’d spit in their faces if you could—if you knew how to spit with such body, and if you knew which one of the creatures’ four distensible appendages was a face. Breaking free of your restrains is a hopeless endeavor, but you struggle to escape regardless. Your efforts do not go unnoticed, and one of the creatures is assigned to watch you. It seems more concerned with preventing you from harming your body than preventing you from escaping. After many days of captivity, you find a way to use this to your advantage. You struggle so hard against your restraints that they pierce into your leathery, cold flesh, drawing out a bit of viscous slime-blood. Your guard quickly apporoaches, clicking its claws together repeatedly. It undoes your restraints, and the moment it does, your claw appendages strike at what you believe to be the creature’s throat. It collapses to the floor, writhing in pain."
msgstr "这些生物绑架了你，甚至还将你从自己的身体里偷走。你拒绝回答这群绑匪提出的哪怕一个问题。要是你能冲它们脸上啐上一口，你早就这么干了——前提是你得知道怎么用这副身体来吐口水，你还得知道这种生物那四根胀大的附肢之中哪一根是它们的脸。冲破自己的束缚只是徒劳而已，但你不论如何都努力尝试挣脱。你的动作被这群生物察觉，它们派出一头生物来看守你。比起阻止你逃离此地，它似乎更注重阻止你伤害自己的身体。在多天的监禁过后，你找到一个办法来利用这一点。你拼命地挣扎著想要挣脱束缚，把你那带有硬皮的冰冷身躯弄伤，流出了粘液似的血液。看守你的生物飞快地赶来，不停地敲击著自己的钳子。它解开你的束缚，此时你挥动附肢，将钳子袭向你认为是它喉咙的部位。它摔倒在地，痛苦挣扎。"

"“Alejandro, what are you—?” You suddenly cry out. A nurse stands over you, peering into your eyes with a small light. You push the nurse away and rise to your feet, suddenly puzzled and disoriented. Despite the nurse’s protests, you wobble feebly out of the room. You are in a hospital, its white halls smelling faintly of disinfectant and other chemicals. Just moments prior, hadn’t you been exploring some kind of underground cavern?… You cannot recall.\n"
"“Excuse me? Come back, you must rest!” The nurse calls out to you, gripping your forearm and pulling you back to your cot. She examines you closely while you recover from the shock of being transported so far in so short a time. “Who is Alejandro?” she asks, and you struggle to recall. The name doesn’t ring a bell.\n"
"You ask the nurse how you came to be here, wondering why she isn’t surprised at your sudden appearance. “Why, you admitted yourself to St. Mary’s just last night. Do you not remember?” You have no memory of this, and you are starting to grow concerned. “You were acting a little strangely, if I may be so bold. And you spoke in a strange fashion, almost as if English weren’t your first language. But now I see that you probably just drank a little bit too much.” She notices your questioning expression and smiles. “Don’t worry. We get that kind of thing quite often these days, now that all the bars and pubs are on the up-and-up again.”\n"
"You examine your face in the mirror. You are tired and older than you remember. Something important lies on the very edge of your memory, fuzzy and blurred. It takes about a minute before the significance of the nurse’s last statement catches up to you. Turning back toward the nurse, you ask what year it is, terrified of the answer.\n"
"“Why, 1934 of course. My, you must have had a heck of a night!” She chuckles."

"“亚歴山卓，你到底——？”你突然尖叫出声。一名护士站在你面前，伴著一束微弱的光芒仔细观察你的眼睛。你推开了那名护士，站了起来，突然感到一阵困惑，不辨方向。不顾护士的劝阻，你拖著无力的身躯摇摇晃晃地走出了房间。你现在所在的地方是个医院，白色的房间里散发著隐隐约约的消毒水和其他药品的气味。就在这之前，你难道不是在探索某个地下洞穴吗？……你想不起来了。\n"
"“你还好吗？请回来，你必须休息！”护士在对你说话，她拉住了你的小臂，将你拉回床边。你在如此短的时间内穿越了这么远的距离，当你惊魂稍定，她凑近对你作检查。“谁是亚历山卓？”她问道。于是你努力地去回想，但你对这个名字没有印象。\n"
"你询问护士，你是怎么到这里来的，而她为什么对你的突然出现毫不意外。“为什么这么问，你自己来到圣玛丽医院申请入院的，就在昨天晚上。你忘了吗？”你对此全无记忆，心生忧虑。“恕我无礼，当时你的行为有些奇怪。你说话的方式也很古怪，就像英语不是你的母语一样。但现在我明白了，你大概只是酒喝多了。”她注意到你满脸疑惑，对你微微一笑，“别担心，最近我们常常遇到这样的情况，毕竟现在所有的酒吧和俱乐部生意又红火起来了。”\n"
"你在镜中检视自己的脸。你比自己记忆中要更疲倦、更年老。在你记忆与遗忘的交界处，有些重要的事情记不真切。过了大概一分钟，你才领悟护士最后一句话的含义。你转身面对护士，问她现在是哪一年，而答案使你万分惊恐。\n"
"“怎么这么问，今年当然是1934年。亲爱的，你准是昨晚玩疯了！”她咯咯轻笑。"
