msgid "Interlude V"
msgstr "幕间故事V"

msgid "You stir awake, lying facedown on the cold, hard stone of the cavern. You are bruised and battered but, somehow, alive. It takes several minutes before you regain enough of your strength to stand. You are absolutely and hopelessly lost within the impossibly vast caverns, enveloped by pitch-black darkness. Have you survived all this way only to perish here, lost to all humanity?"
msgstr "你醒了过来，面朝下躺在冰冷而坚硬的洞穴岩石上。你鼻青脸肿，像是挨了一顿毒打，但不知为何你仍然活著。花了好几分钟，你才恢复了些气力，能够站起身来。在这个庞大到难以置信的洞窟里，你彻底迷失了方向，全无希望，周围笼罩著的是犹如沥青的黑暗。你只能这样苟存性命，静待死亡来临，与人类永别？"

msgid "The grim, blood-red caverns and resentful cities of Yoth hold no candle to the terrifying depths that lie below them. You are in the deepest level of this subterranean realm now: the caverns Ichtaca referred to as “N’kai.” Nothing could have prepared you for the impervious murk that surrounds you on all sides, an inky darkness that none of your light sources can penetrate. You grope around in the darkness until you feel the jagged wall of the cavern and begin to follow it aimlessly, desperately hoping to find the way forward. A grim realization dawns on you: Even should you complete your task, you will surely never find a way back to the surface. The overwhelming darkness of the cavern fills you with a dread you have never before experienced. You cannot see your hands as you grope about in the darkness, nor can you tell if you are in a narrow tunnel or a vast open space. The ground beside you could extend for miles or abruptly become a bottomless cavern, and you would not be able to tell the difference unless you stepped there. Hours pass as you stumble in the dark, slowly, carefully, nervously. Every step could be your last."
msgstr "昏暗而血红的洞穴，以及名为幽嘶的满腔仇恨的城市，都无法与其下方的可怖深渊相提并论。你所在的正是这地下领域的最深层：伊塔卡提过的名为“恩凯”的洞穴。你四面八方都是密不透风的黑暗，你的所有装备都无法应对当前的处境，一切光源都无法穿透这漆黑。你在黑暗中四处摸索，终于触碰到洞穴的凹凸岩壁，你开始漫无目的地循著它前行，只想要赶快找到出路。你突然意识到：即使你完成了自己的任务，你也肯定找不到回到地面的路。洞穴里铺天盖地的黑暗让你心生惧意，在此之前你从未如此惧怕。当你在黑暗中摸索时，你看不见自己的双手，也不知道自己是在一条狭窄的隧道里，还是在一片开阔的空间里。你周遭的地面可能有连续展开的几英里长，也可能突然出现一个无底深洞，而你只有踩上去才能分辨。你跌跌撞撞地在黑暗中走了好几个小时，步履缓慢，谨慎而紧张。你所走的每一步都可能是你的最后一步。"

msgstr "查看冒险日志。如果<i>调查员找回了丢失的遗物</i>，调查员队长阅读<b>神秘的嗡嗡声</b>。"

msgid "Worried that your fall may have damaged the Eztli relic, you pull it out of your pack and examine it. Oddly, the device seems completely undamaged. It vibrates with a growing intensity, humming louder now than ever before."
msgstr "你担心自己的坠落会使埃兹特里的遗物受到损伤，于是你将它从背包中取出，仔细检查。古怪的是，这件器具似乎完好无损。它震动得愈发激烈，嗡啥的响声也变得更加响亮。"

msgid "Final Dawning"
msgstr "茅塞顿开"

msgid "Without Alejandro or Ichtaca to distract you, you find yourself studying the relic intently. Both of your “guides” have only fed you lies. They hid the relic’s true nature from you, manipulating you in an attempt to bring the relic to this very place. After your experience with the Great Race of Yith, you think you understand why. The technology behind the device’s design is far beyond what any human could accomplish, but quite possible for the Yithians. You even recognize some elements of the relic’s construction from the technology in Pnakotus. Somehow, it ended up in the hands of the Eztli, who defended it with care from all manner of creatures. Creatures that predate humanity. Creatures who wished to use it to turn back time. And now that the relic is in your possession, only you can stop this from occurring."
msgstr "没有亚歴山卓和伊塔卡在旁令你分心，你发现自己能够更加专心地研究遗物。你的两位“向导”都曾对你说谎。他们对你隐瞒了遗物的真相，还利用你将遗物带到此地。在与伟大种族伊斯相处之后，你认为自己已经了解这背后的原因。这件器具的设计背后的技术远非人类所能及，反而很有可能是出自伊斯人之手。你甚至认出了这件遗物结构里的某些部件是出自纳克特的技术。但不知为何，它最终落入埃兹特里人之手，在他们的保护之下未受任何生物的沾染，那些比人类历史更早的生物，它们企图用遗物来回溯时光。而如今这件遗物落在你手，只有你才能阻止这一切发生。"

msgid "The investigator with Relic of Ages in their deck swaps it with the new version of Relic of Ages included in this Mythos Pack: Relic of Ages (<i>Repossess the Past</i>)."
msgstr "如果调查员的牌组内有古代遗物，将它替换成本神秘档案中新版本的古代遗物：古代遗物(<i>重拾往昔</i>)。"

msgid "As you rise to your feet, the ground rumbles and growls. Something deep below you is moving. Shifting. Mutating."
msgstr "就在你站起身的时候，地面传来了轰隆声和咆哮声。你下方有什么东西正在移动。位置飘忽。变化无定。"

msgid "Though the light from your torches is snuffed by the overpowering darkness of this realm, you decide to try to light the brazier with the flames. To your surprise, after you hold the torch against the strange cubes for several moments, the brazier erupts in a fury of blue and silver flames, consuming your torch and almost melting your hand to the bone. Though the light from the brilliant flame only reaches a few yards around you, more braziers light up in the distance, their flames guiding your path forward. At least, you hope…"
msgstr "尽管你火把的光亮被这地下领域压倒性的黑暗所吞没，你还是决定用火焰点亮这个火盆。让你惊奇的是，在你将火把对著那些怪异的方块片刻过后，火盆突然喷发出银蓝色的火焰，燃尽了你的火把，还几乎把你的手烧剩白骨。尽管这束明亮的火焰只照亮了你周围几码的范围，但远处更多的火盆相继亮起，它们的火焰将指引你前进的道路。至少，你希望如此……"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>the braziers are lit</i>."
msgstr "在冒险日志中，记录下<i>你点燃了火盆</i>。"

msgid "The odd material inside does not seem to accept any source of fire you use to try to light it. Your hope is snuffed out along with the light around you. Miserable, you prepare to endure the darkness ahead."
msgstr "你用尽一切火源试图点燃这火盆，但似乎无法点著它内部的特异材料。你心中的希望也跟身旁的光亮一同被吞没。强忍著心中的苦涩，你准备继续摸黑前行。"

msgstr "解读印记"

msgid "As you traverse the caverns, something catches your attention: streams of cold, gentle water that drip down the walls of the cavern. Curious, you unfold the previous expedition’s map and sit by one of the lit braziers, mentally retracing your steps. If your calculations are correct, you have traveled much farther south than you could have possibly guessed. Could it be these caverns extend all the way to the coastline? Do the caverns never end?"
msgstr "就在你穿过洞穴时，有什么东西吸引了你的注意：有一股冰冷而轻缓的水流从洞穴的石壁流下。你好奇地打开前一次探险的地图，在点燃的火盆旁边坐下，回想著你经过的路。如果你的推算无误，你向南走了很远的距离，比所能想像的要更远。这些洞穴会一直延伸到海岸线吗？还是说永远不会到尽头？"

msgid "Each investigator with a map earns 2 additional experience as they gain insight into the caverns that dwell beneath the surface of the Earth."
msgstr "调查员洞察了地表以下的洞穴群，每位带有地图的调查员获得2点额外的经验值。"
