msgstr "幕间故事III：丛林的呼唤"

msgid "Once more, you venture south, leaving the safety of civilization behind. There is no time to waste. The path to the Nexus lies on familiar ground, not far from the previous expedition’s trail. Using the leather-bound journal as your guide, you retrace the expedition’s journey. Soon, you are deep within the jungle, surrounded on all sides by hazards—some natural, others bizarre…"

msgstr "不幸的是，你的车子跑了约莫十几英里来到雨林边境，燃料已经用光了。由于时间紧张，你决定不返回补充燃料，而是接下来的旅途改以徒步行进。这花了你好几个小时，但你很快就再次到达了这片丛林。"

msgstr "毒性仍在你体内扩散，破坏著你的五脏六腑。你的体温一天高过一天，感觉自己像著了火一样。你几乎无法进食，身体的所有力气彷佛都被抽空了。"

msgid "As you trudge through the lush jungle and pass a series of familiar overgrown temple ruins, your keen eye spots a pattern along the stone wall of the structure. Upon closer examination, you find that vines and caked dirt has hidden an elaborate carving of hieroglyphs."
msgstr "艰难地穿过茂密的丛林时，你经过许多荒芜的神庙遗迹，它们看起来很熟悉，而你敏锐的双眼发现了建筑的石壁上带有图案。你凑近仔细观察，在藤蔓和厚厚尘土的埋藏之下，发现了刻于石上密密麻麻的象形文字。"

"On the eve of your second night within the jungle, you and your companions sit in front of a dim campfire, keeping warm and trying to remain relaxed despite the task ahead of you. Ichtaca approaches the campfire and sits across from you. Her eyes are cast to the ground, and her shoulders sag with a burdensome weight. “I feel that I must apologize to you,” she admits, peering into the flickering fire. “You have proven yourselves to be both wise and formidable, and I have done nothing but command you and endanger you at every turn.” There is a long, peaceful pause between you. “Perhaps there is hope for humanity after all,” she says under her breath as she meets your gaze. Does she speak for you? Or for herself, as well?\n"
"Ichtaca rises to her feet after some time. “I trust you to take the first watch. Be on the lookout for serpents. They are surely on the lookout for us.” Your camp is quiet for the remainder of the night, but for the soothing crackling of the campfire and the choir of chirping insects whose singing fills the night air."

"在丛林度过的第二天傍晚，你和同伴们坐在黯淡的营火前取暖，并且试著让自己放松下来，暂时忘却自己将要面对的任务。伊塔卡来到营火前，坐在你旁边。她望向地面，肩膀彷佛承受著莫大的重量一般沉了下来。“我得跟你说声抱歉。”她凝视著摇曳的火焰，开始诉说，“你证明了自己的智慧与强大，而我除了向你发号施令，每每让你陷入险境之外什么忙都没帮上。”一阵漫长而寂静的沉默横亘在你们两人之间。“或许，人类还有希望。”她与你目光相接，压低声音说道。她是在对你说话吗？还是说这句话也是对她自己说的？\n"
"过了一会，伊塔卡站起身来。“你先守夜吧，我信得过你。要戒备蛇族，它们肯定也在盯著我们。”你的营地在这晚接下来的时间里都很寂静，只剩下营火的劈啪声，还有夜空里齐声和鸣的昆虫唧喳声，给你的内心带来抚慰。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>Ichtaca’s faith is restored</i>. Add 1 [cultist] token to the chaos bag for the remainder of the campaign."
msgstr "在冒险日志中，记录下<i>伊塔卡重振信念</i>。将1个[cultist]标记加入混乱袋，持续到这个剧本结束。"
