"There will be no rest for us this summer, it seems.\n"
"Today I met with Harlan Earnstone, a historical theorist at Miskatonic University and an old friend of mine. He’d said he had a job offer for me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect.\n"
"Harlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers.\n"
"Alejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this— or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along.\n"
"The way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer. Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."

"看来今年夏天我们没工夫休息了。\n"
"今天我去见我的老朋友，米斯卡塔尼克大学的历史理论家哈伦·恩斯通。他说他有份差事给我，但老实说，我不知道他要介绍什么差事给我。\n"
"哈伦向我介绍了他的一位同事：亚历山卓·维拉，一位来自南部边境以外的著名历史学家。维拉先生毕业于墨西哥城一所知名学府，他用了许多年来寻找阿兹特克王国。他声称找到了证据，能够证明一个前所未闻的阿兹特克城邦——埃兹特里的存在。他古怪而空前的发现未被大学接受，还遭到了同行的唾弃。\n"
"亚历山卓来到阿卡姆寻求赞助，筹措前往墨西哥南部丛林探险的资金，他相信埃兹特里城邦的遗迹就在那儿，等待被发现。他对于那个城邦起源的描述，有悖于当代对中美洲历史的理解。尽管如此，或者说，凭我对这位老友的了解，哈伦正因为这一点，才沉醉于亚历山卓的发现。米斯卡塔尼克大学同意出资赞助这次探险(尽管金额不多)，哈伦希望我同行。\n"
"在我看来，很有可能我们所寻找的东西根本就不存在。但若是埃兹特里人有存在的可能性，哪怕微乎其微，都具有深远的历史意义。我们为此事争论了好一会，但最终我还是接受了亚历山卓的邀请。准备工作紧密进行著，我们将在月底之前出发。如果运气好的话，我们会让这本日志上写满各种有趣的发现。不然，这本日志多半就只能被哈伦拿来垫桌脚了。"
