msgstr "冒险IV：界限彼端"

msgid "Rays of hot yellow sunlight beat down on you from above as your car speeds down the dusty highways of southern Texas, just outside of San Antonio. It has been several days since you hit the road from Arkham on your way to Mexico City, where you may be able to get answers from some of Alejandro’s associates—or even better, from his adversaries in academia. Your recent investigations in Arkham uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail went cold soon after. The “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but vanished from the city. Its members left behind little information as to their next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever, the Eztli warrior sits in the passenger seat next to you. She is tense and coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her little comfort."
msgstr "当你驱车奔驰在德克萨斯州南部，圣安东尼奥城外尘土飞扬的公路上时，炎热的阳光照射下来。距离你从阿卡姆城前往墨西哥城已经过了好几天，在那儿你或许能询问亚历山卓的几位同事——要是运气更好的话，甚至还能问问他在学术界的对头。你最近在阿卡姆开展的调查颇有斩获，但即便你发挥毕生才学，追查到的线索还是转瞬即逝。你在阿卡姆城揭露的“兄弟会”几乎已从这座城市销声匿迹。除了“恩凯联结点”这个名字以外，那个组织的成员几乎没留下甚么线索，你对他们的下一个目标一无所知。伊塔卡确信，那个汇聚著能量的地方正是兄弟会的最终目的地。这名埃兹特里战士一如以往的神秘莫测，坐在你旁边的乘客座位上。她身体紧绷，像弹簧一样蜷曲著，福特汽车的真皮座椅并没能使她放松半分。"

msgid "“How close are we?” Ichtaca asks for the hundredth time since departing from Arkham. “We have to get to Anahuac as fast as we can. The longer we take, the more time the Brotherhood has to reach the Nexus.” You recognize the old Aztec name for the Valley of Mexico, and inform Ichtaca that you will be crossing the border into Mexico within the hour. She crosses her arms and grits her teeth."
msgstr "“还有多远才到？”自从离开阿卡姆城开始，这已经是伊塔卡问的第一百遍了。“我们必须尽快赶到‘阿那瓦克’去。我们花的时间越长，兄弟会就有越多的时间能够到达联结点。”你听出了这是墨西哥一个山谷的名字，得名于古老的阿兹特克，你告诉伊塔卡，你们会在一个小时内穿过边境，进入墨西哥。她双臂交叉，咬紧牙关。"

"Throughout your journey, Alejandro scribbles endlessly in his journal, the sound of pencil scratching against paper a constant reminder of his presence. He remains huddled in the back seat of the car, his knees keeping the journal still, his brows furrowed in thought. “This ‘Brotherhood’ is the least of our concerns,” he says with an air of finality. “I’ve been trying to decrypt the glyphs the device bears. The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\n"
"Ichtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\n"
"Crossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

"在你的整趟旅程中，亚历山卓没完没了地写著他的日志，铅笔沙沙地摩擦纸张，这声响不断提醒著你他的存在。他缩在汽车后座上，膝盖还支著日志，正皱著眉头沉思。“我们不用管什么‘兄弟会’。”他笃定地说道，“我曾经尝试破解遗物上的雕文。那些符号明显不属于阿兹特克人，也不属于马雅人，甚至不来自其他任何的中美洲文明。我认为这件遗物来自别的什么地方。它是被从那儿带到这儿来的。你难道不这么认为吗，伊塔卡小姐？”\n"
"伊塔卡本就冷酷的表情一暗，眼睛瞇了起来。对亚历山卓开口之前，她甚至都没从座位上转过身来。“在它诞生的地方，爱管闲事的学者不能滥用它的力量。”她冷冰冰地回答，结束了这次交谈。\n"
"有赖于亚历山卓的人脉，你穿过边境前往墨西哥的时候没你想像中的那么费劲。你轻松地通过了海关，他们甚至都没有瞥你一眼，片刻后你们已经在前往墨西哥城的路上了。"

msgstr "你在边境以北把车停了下来，好在这过夜。你的目光被空荡荡的后座所吸引，你想知道亚历山卓现在到哪去了。"

msgid "Fuel is a constant concern throughout your journey south. You are able to refuel several times along the way at general and hardware stores, but eventually your car putters out along the side of the road, just north of the southern border. You and Ichtaca are forced to walk several miles to the nearest town to refuel, setting you back several hours."
msgstr "在你的南部之旅中，需要时刻注意燃料。在路上的便利店或五金店，你可以补充几次燃料，但是突然间，就在南部边境以北的地方，你的车子在马路边上熄了火。你和伊塔卡不得不走了几英里到最近的城市去补充燃料，耽误了好几个小时。"

"After arriving in Mexico City, you are disheartened to find very little information regarding the Brotherhood or the Nexus. You peruse the archives of the city’s libraries and universities, but come up empty- handed. You can’t find any of Alejandro’s former colleagues in the city, and even his enemies refuse to speak to you, save for one: a woman named Padma Amrita, who studied Alejandro’s work before he came to Arkham. She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\n"
"Padma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs.\n"
"Once she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation…"

"抵达墨西哥城之后，你几乎找不到关于兄弟会或“联结点”的信息，令你沮丧不已。你仔细翻阅城内各所图书馆和大学保存的档案，但却一无所获。你在这座城市里一个亚历山卓的前同事都找不到，连他的论敌都不愿与你交谈，只有一个人例外：一位名叫帕德玛·阿姆丽塔的女士，她在亚历山卓来到阿卡姆之前就研究过他的学说。她愿意在今晚的晚些时候与你见上一面，约在城南的一间时髦的酒吧。伊塔卡站在你不远处，静静地留意著你新找到的情报提供者。\n"
"帕德玛对于亚历山卓的研究知之甚详，还声称自己听说过“恩凯联结点”，但她不愿告诉你如何才能找到那个地方。“傻子才要干这事呢。”她对你说道，“那个地方是找不到的，不过是虚构的神话。相信我，很多人都找过它，但没人找得到。”你指出埃兹特里人并非虚构，而她对你报以一个迷人的微笑，“或许那不是假的，但所谓的埃兹特里人还‘活著’？这几百年间都没被人发现？”她纵情大笑“满嘴胡话，你真是天真又单纯。得了吧，难不成你还以为会有‘正牌’学者相信这话？”你的目光转向伊塔卡，她双臂交叉著偷听你谈话，指甲深深嵌进了自己的小臂。帕德玛的目光也一同转来，嘴角上扬，流露出得意的神色。“不管怎样，我得跟你说声对不起，我没有任何对你有用的信息。只有傻子才会继续这项‘研究’，祝你好运。”帕德玛换上另一种迷人的微笑转身离去，身后留下了一阵甜香。\n"
"她走出视线后，伊塔卡马上在你旁边坐下，与你讨论下一步行动。过去的一周里，她尝尽了失败的滋味，耐心逐渐消退。你提出接下来问话的几个人选，但她心不在焉。当你回到旅馆时，她马上回到自己的房间为明天作准备。你决定今晚就此睡下，而过了不久，你的思绪开始飘忽，迷迷糊糊地陷入熟睡。在你意识深处，不知怎的，你听到伊塔卡在念诵一种神秘的咒语……"

"When you next open your eyes, you are back in the bed of your hotel room. You raise your hand to shield your eyes from the sunlight that pierces through the bedroom’s curtains. The glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples. Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air.\n"
"Rising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\n"
"Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back. I know where to find the Nexus, and you must journey with me.”"

"你需要十分艰难的努力才能站起身。你脑海深处响起一道细微的声音，告诉你这一切都是你自己的想像，只是过于疲倦而引起的一场噩梦。那是自我保护的声音，警告你不要继续走上疯狂之路。你不理会这声音，试著站起身，双脚在恐惧和疲乏的驱使下哆哆嗦嗦。周围寂静无声，你呼唤伊塔卡，想问问她是否还记得昨晚发生的事情——或者她当时在不在那里。你发现她瘫倒在地，背靠著旅馆房间的门。她失去了知觉，毫无反应，脸色苍白。你满怀担忧，试了好几分钟来弄醒她，终于成功了。她呛了一口唾沫并恢复知觉，剧烈地咳嗽，浑身抽蓄，就像著了魔一般。“那个洞穴——天空中的那张血色巨口，你看见它了吗？”\n"
"你试图回想昨晚发生的事情，脑袋便阵阵作痛，只得摇头。“那准是通往联结点的路，”她继续用一只手紧紧地扶著自己的脑袋说道。你想要扶她站起来，但被她推开。“我刚刚在‘想’什么？界线越来越薄弱，再受压迫的话就会破裂。”她的目光转向你，“我不该把你卷进来的，但不论喜欢与否，你都被卷进来了。现在要回头已经太晚了。我知道在哪能找到联结点，你必须和我一起走。”"

When you next open your eyes, you are lying in the city’s central plaza, your head still spinning from the sensation of plummeting.

"“That woman…She must have realized who I am and followed through the breach I made. Perhaps she wished to know the location of the Nexus, as well,” Ichtaca says cryptically. Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of the past few hours. “You saw it, did you not? The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\n"
"It is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing…Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains unspoken: In the haze of broken timelines and unexplainable phenomena, the path you saw was “one future.” A future you intend to fulfill."

"你很难记起在那边具体发生了什么，但红色洞穴的景象仍留存在你记忆中。你告诉伊塔卡，你也看见了那个洞穴，并且问她怎么知道那个地方是通向联结点的。她通红的双眼与你目光相接，你发现她嘴角带有一丝笑意。“这事很难做到……要凝视界限的另一头，甚至是看到时间线。或许你比你看起来的要更强大。”她语带讽刺，令你不解。她没有回答你的问题便离开了，但你已经知道了她没说出口的那个答案：支离破碎的时间线和无法解释的现象如同一团迷雾，而你从中看见的道路是“一个未来”。一个你将实现的未来。"
