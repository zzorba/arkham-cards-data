"We have finally made it back to Arkham, our expedition a “success.” Alejandro is excited to report his findings to the university. How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\n"
"Alejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private. I’ll have to decide tonight; after tomorrow, there won’t be time to change my mind…"

"我们终于成功回到了阿卡姆，这次探险“成功”了。亚历山卓要向大学汇报自己的发现，他为此激动不已。我不理解他为什么在经过丛林的遭遇之后，还能继续满怀热诚、双目放光地坚持自己的理想主义。他专注于我们从遗迹里找到的那件古怪遗物，但愿我们能对它的起源有多一些了解。它使我心神激荡，难以平静。它一直嗡嗡作响，伴随著我难以描述的超于现世的能量而搏动著。自从我们带著这件遗物回来之后，每晚都被怪异的噩梦所折磨，我们在梦里看到了其他的世界和文明。\n"
"亚历山卓要我将这件遗物带回米斯卡塔尼克博物馆，和我们发现的其他埃兹特里遗物一同展示。我百感交集。它会在博物馆里得到妥善的保管，可供历史学家研究，甚至可能得知它的用途。但是，我担心这件遗物公开展示可能过于危险。我们仍然不知道这该死的东西究竟是什么。或许应该将这个遗物存放在安全的地方，以供我和哈伦私下对它研究，但我猜亚历山卓不喜欢这样。今晚我就得做决定；在明天之后，就没时间改变主意了……"

"I’ve decided to give custody of the relic to Alejandro. This entire expedition was based on his research, after all—he should be the one to study it. If anyone can discover the relic’s secrets, it’s him.\n"
"The relic is to be the centerpiece of a new exhibit at the museum. Alejandro has already written extensively about our discoveries, but his work has only just begun. Many mysteries about our expedition remain. How have the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear to be guarding the jungle, and from what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored? I have no doubt Alejandro will uncover the answers to these questions, given enough time.\n"
"As for me, my role in this endeavor has ended. However, I have yet to relax. My thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths. When I walk through the streets, I find myself drawn toward the museum without realizing it, as though possessed to see the relic once again. There is a nagging sensation in the back of my mind, as though we have forgotten something important. What must I do to rid myself of—\n"

"我决定将这件遗物交给亚历山卓保管。说到底，这整场探险都是为他的研究服务的——应该由他来研究这东西。要是有人能够发现这件遗物的秘密，那准是他。\n"
"这件遗物将成为博物馆新展览的核心展品。亚历山卓已经为我们的发现费了不少笔墨，但他的研究才刚刚开始。我们的探险之旅仍有不少未知之谜。埃兹特里人为什么这么久都未被发现？他们似乎在保卫丛林，是出于什么目的？丛林又是为什么需要保卫呢？我们探索的神庙遗迹到底是谁建造的？我相信如果时间足够，亚历山卓定能找出这些问题的答案。\n"
"至于我，这件事我已经帮不上忙了。可是，我还是放松不下来。我的思绪始终停留在丛林里——阴影中的蛇形生物、嵌入尸骨中的黑曜石箭枝，从洞穴深处传来失真的尖叫声。我走过一条条街道时，发现自己竟浑然不觉地向著博物馆的方向走去，就像著了魔一样想要再看那遗物一眼。我脑海中有种感觉挥之不去，似乎我们忘了某些重要的事情。我得让自己摆脱那——\n"

"I’ve decided to keep the relic hidden for now. Alejandro is not happy with my decision, but until we know what the orb is capable of, it’s important that it stay somewhere safe, where it won’t endanger others. Harlan agrees with me, and has offered to take custody of the relic and keep it in his private office. There, we can study the artifact in secret.\n"
"Alejandro is staying in Arkham for the time being, recording his notes about the expedition and helping the museum put together an exhibit displaying our other, less dangerous discoveries. As for me, I hope to find answers to other mysteries: How have the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear to be guarding the jungle, and from what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored?\n"
"My thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths.

"我决定暂时保管这件遗物。亚历山卓对我的决定并不满意，但是只要我们还不知道这个钢球的作用，它就必须放在稳妥的地方，以免危及他人的安全。哈伦同意我的决定，提出由他来保管遗物，并存放到他的私人办公室。我们就在那儿秘密研究这件遗物。\n"
"亚历山卓暂时住在阿卡姆，将本次探险的经历作记录，并帮助博物馆将我们找到的危害性较低的其他遗物一同展出。至于我，我希望找到其他谜团的答案：埃兹特里人为什么这么久都未被发现？他们似乎在保卫丛林，是出于什么目的？丛林又是为什么需要保卫呢？我们探索的神庙遗迹到底是谁建造的？\n"

"You drop your pen as a loud knocking at the door startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in the morning. Who could possibly be at your door at this hour? Your thoughts wander again to the jungle, and you are faced with a vision of serpent-creatures attacking you in your own home. Shuddering, you find a weapon and approach the front door carefully, ready to strike if need be. You take a long breath and open the door.\n"
"On the other side is a familiar woman with brown skin, long brown hair, and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard glare. Though her attire has changed, you recognize her instantly as Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior you encountered in the rainforest. Wearing a long coat and a Bollman hat, she is visibly uncomfortable in her shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. You are about to raise your weapon in defense when she lets out a heavy sigh and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever you did, you have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will all cease to exist.”"

"一阵响亮的敲门声把你吓了一跳，手里的钢笔都掉到了地上。这时临近凌晨2:30。谁会在这个时间来敲你的门呢？你的思绪再次飘回了丛林，脑海中浮现了一个景象：蛇人来到你的家中攻击你。你战战兢兢，找出一件武器并小心地走近前门，做好了攻击的准备，以防万一。你深吸一口气，把门打开。\n"
"门的另一边是一位熟悉的女士，有著古铜色皮肤，棕色长卷发，她一双金色的明眸目光锐利，怒目圆睁。尽管她换了一身穿著，你还是立即认出了她——伊塔卡，你在丛林里遇到的埃兹特里战士。她穿著一件长大衣，戴著一顶博尔曼帽子，很显然她穿著鞋子不太自在。她怒不可遏。你正准备举起武器防御的时候，她重重地叹了一口气，慢步走进你家并关上了前门。“不管你做了什么，你必须得将它逆转，”她用阴郁的口吻说道，“否则我们都将不复存在。”"

"Harlan Earnstone paces across your living room, dabbing his wrinkled forehead with his handkerchief. “It’s my fault. I should never have encouraged them to go on that dreadful expedition.” Though your paths have only crossed a few times before, Mr. Earnstone has become a valuable contact of yours within Miskatonic University. When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n"
"“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet…I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures they encountered…” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for all of us. Read this journal, and if you can, please keep an eye on my colleague.” You agree to help, but his worry does not fade. “I only hope that I am not damning you to a similar fate by asking for your aid.”\n"
"You spend the remainder of that night studying the expedition journal, your mind swimming with thoughts of strange serpent-creatures and Aztec warriors. Long after Harlan has left, a loud knocking at the door startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in the morning. Who could possibly be at your door at this hour? You open the front door warily. On the other side is a woman with brown skin, long brown hair, and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard glare. She wears a long coat and a Bollman-style hat, visibly uncomfortable in her shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. A sudden flash of insight crosses your mind, and you realize at once who she must be. After all, you’ve read and re-read the journal’s description of Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior. She lets out a heavy sigh and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever they did, you have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will all cease to exist.”"

"哈伦·恩斯通走进了你的起居室，用他的手帕擦拭著满布皱纹的前额。“是我的错。我不该鼓动他们参加这场凶险的探险。”尽管你们只有寥寥几次交集，恩斯通先生已成为你在米斯卡塔尼克大学重要的联络人。最近这场探险只有几人幸免于难，带回了几件怪异的古代遗物，所以他前来寻求你的建议。\n"
"“我知道，我知道。这次探险尽管损伤惨重，但是成功了，这最终的结果至少可以让我聊以自慰。亚历山卓说的没错，埃兹特里人是真实存在的，而且存在至今……我担心其中的一些发现会引起恐慌。哈伦从自己的手提箱里拿出一本皮面的日志，递给你。“在探险队队长壮烈牺牲之前，他将队伍的发现都记在了这本日志里。探险队的其中一位幸存者赶在逃出丛林之前，从营地里找出了这本日志。我想，你要是读了这些日志，你会明白我的意思。他们的经历，还有他们遭遇的那些生物……”哈伦浑身发抖，用颤抖的双手扶著自己的眼镜。“我担心的不只是亚历山卓一人，而是我们所有人。读一读这本日志，还有，如果可以的话，请留心我的这位同事。”你答应帮他的忙，但他的忧虑并未消减。“我只希望我请你帮忙的这件事，不要害你遇上相同的命运。”\n"
"在这晚接下来的时间里，你都在研读探险队的日志，你的思绪在古怪的蛇人和阿兹特克的战士之间游移。哈伦离开之后过了很久，一阵响亮的敲门声把你吓了一跳。这时临近凌晨2:30。谁会在这个时间来敲你的门呢？你谨慎地打开了前门。门的另一边是一位女士，有著古铜色的皮肤，棕色长卷发，她一双金色的明眸目光锐利，怒目圆睁。她穿著一件长大衣，戴著一顶博尔曼帽子，很显然她穿著鞋子不太自在。她怒不可遏。你的脑中突然灵光一闪，你马上认出了她是谁。毕竟你把日志里对埃兹特里战士伊塔卡的描述读了一遍又一遍。她重重地叹了一口气，慢步走进你家并关上了前门。“不管他们做了什么，你必须得将它逆转，”她用阴郁的口吻说道，“否则我们都将不复存在。”"
