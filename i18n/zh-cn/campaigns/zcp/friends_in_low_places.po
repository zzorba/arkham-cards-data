You got the savvy to have made it past the suits, and you care about this city. You got a good head on your shoulders. City doesn't need me to keep the Agency's secrets.

Your eyes lose focus, and for a moment, you see through many eyes at once. You see one self weaving robes of flesh and reciting twisted chants. Another howls, and slowly drags itself arm over arm from a deep tunnel into dark woods. Another stares over a corpse and curses fate.\n"
