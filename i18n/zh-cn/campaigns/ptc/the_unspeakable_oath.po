"“Wake up, Daniel.” The words echo in your thoughts as you pace through the disheveled room, trying to make sense of what you’d just experienced. You had awoken that afternoon with a violent startle, your body shaking, bedsheets soaked with sweat. Although you’d slept a healthy eight-and-a-half hours, you feel even more exhausted than you had the previous night. You catch a glimpse of your dark, bloodshot eyes in the mirror next to the dresser, and wonder if you’ve gotten any real sleep at all.\n"
"Who is Daniel, you wonder? The chamber from your dream looked like a prison, but the man—Daniel—he seemed unhinged, as though he wasn’t in control of his mind. This led to only one conclusion: An asylum. Knowing you’ll get little rest here, you head towards Arkham Asylum, hoping your hunch is correct."

"“给我醒醒，丹尼尔。”就在你穿过一片狼藉的房间，试图搞清楚方才你到底经历了什么的时候，你的脑海中响起了一道声音。\n"
"你猛然惊醒，汗水湿透了床单，此时已是中午。尽管你睡了足有八个半小时，但你却感到比前一晚更疲惫。你从梳妆镜中瞥见自己眼圈乌青，眼睛布满血丝，你怀疑自己是不是压根就没睡著。\n"
"你满心疑惑，谁是丹尼尔？你梦中的那个小房间看起来像是监狱，但是那名男子——丹尼尔——他似乎精神失常，头脑不听使唤。 只能得出一个推断：这是一家疯人院。你知道自己没法在这好好休息，动身前往阿卡姆疯人院，但愿你的预感是对的。"

"Over the course of the next few days, you delve into the evidence you’ve collected, hoping to find any information regarding Daniel Chesterfield, a stagehand during the previous production of The King in Yellow. As far as you can tell, he is the only surviving member of that production’s cast and crew. The rest of them—that is, those for whom you can find any records at all—disappeared or died soon after opening night in a variety of fashions connected only by their morbidness. Freak accidents. Suicides. Vanishings.\n"
"It would seem that Daniel is your only lead, if you are to investigate further. According to the records you found, he was admitted to Arkham Asylum many years ago. All documentation about Daniel’s treatment seems to end there. You’re unsure if he’s even still alive. Perhaps he was cured and released. You were hoping to avoid this, but there seems to be only one way to find out. You collect your belongings and head downtown, towards Arkham Asylum."

"在接下来的几天里，你深入钻研你所收集到的证据，希望能够从中找出关于丹尼尔·契斯特菲尔德的信息，他是《黄衣之王》早年演出的一名舞台工作人员。据你所知，他是那场演出的演职人员中唯一的幸存者。而其他的演职人员——所有能在记录中找到的——在演出当晚之后不久便失踪或死亡，他们的遇害形式各不相同，但却都呈现出病态的异常。离奇事故、自杀身亡、凭空消失。\n"
"如果要作进一步的调查，丹尼尔似乎是你唯一的线索了。根据你找到的记录，他在很多年以前就被送进了阿卡姆疯人院。在那之后，关于丹尼尔接受治疗的文件再无下文。你不知道他现在是否还活著。可能他早已痊愈出院，如果真是这样的话你的调查将难上加难，但要找到答案只得一种办法。你收拾行囊，出发前往市中心的阿卡姆疯人院。"

"As you enter the asylum, you stop to speak with the receptionist, though you feel your body urged to step deeper into the clutches of this madhouse. He gives you a confused expression as you tell him of The King in Yellow and of Daniel. But at your insistence, he pores through his file cabinet, eventually pulling out a stark white folder. Inside is a wealth of information about the patients admitted to the asylum—medical records, psychiatric evaluations, and the like. You recognize a few of the faces as he flips through the pages. “Daniel… Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of Doctor Mintz. But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.” You argue and insist to be let into the patient wing, knowing that Daniel must hold the key to understanding what is really going on.\n"
"The receptionist gives a pitying smile and relents, nodding to the security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of course,” he says with all the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you with Doctor Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel. These gentlemen will see you in.” Relieved that you will soon get the answers you seek, you are escorted into the patient wing of Arkham Asylum…"

"当你步入疯人院时，你停下脚步与接待员谈话，但你感觉你的身体在驱使著你一步一步迈向疯子的聚居地。你向接待员提到《黄衣之王》和丹尼尔时，他的脸庞上流露出困惑的表情。但是在你的坚持之下，他从档案柜里一番好找，终于找出一个样式简陋的白色文件夹。里面有著病人的许多资料——病例，精神评估报告等等。就在他翻页时，你认出了几张面孔。“丹尼尔……丹尼尔·契斯特菲尔德，对吗？他是在明茨医生的特殊护理下收容入院的。但你不能见他；他当前的级别只允许医院员工进行探视。”你与他争辩起来，坚持要进入病房大楼，因为你坚信丹尼尔掌握著通向真相的门匙，找到他你才能明白这一切。\n"
"接待员怜悯地笑笑，态度变得缓和，他向旁边的警卫点了点头。“噢，当然，当然，”他带有街头小贩般恳切的口气。“我会安排你与明茨医生会面，到时你就可以问他有关丹尼尔的事情了。这几位先生会领你进去的。”你马上就会得到你所追寻的答案，不由得放下心来，在护送之下走进了阿卡姆疯人院的病房大楼。"

msgid "You recall what Constance had told you when you spoke with her during her hellish dinner party. She and the other members of the cast and crew had been told by the director, Nigel Engram, to take some kind of oath. At first, she’d written it off as the whim of an eccentric artist; something Mr. Engram did as a strange formality to unite and strengthen the bonds of the cast and crew. And to his credit, she claimed that it had worked; ever since they’d taken his strange oath, she and the other members of the troupe felt much more confident and full of spirit. Perhaps Daniel had a similar experience during the last production of <u>The King in Yellow</u>. You must speak with him about this."
msgstr "你回想起康斯坦丝在她那地狱般的宴会上告诉你的事情。导演奈杰尔‧英格兰姆曾告诉她和其他的演职人员要进行某种宣誓。一开始，她将这看作是怪人艺术家的心血来潮；英格兰姆先生所做的或许是一种奇怪的仪式，用来加强演职人员之间的关系，使大家团结起来。她声称这确实有效，值得对导演大加褒奖；自从他们宣读导演那奇怪的誓言之后，她和剧团的其他成员感到更加自信，并且富有活力。或许丹尼尔在上一次的《黄衣之王》演出中也有相同的经历。你得跟他谈谈这事。"

"“Doctor Mintz, the patient has been medicated and is ready to see you now.” Nurse Heather opened the file on the desk nearby, taking a moment to review the patient’s records.\n"
"“Any changes in the patient’s condition?” Doctor Mintz asked in a monotone voice. A formality. Both knew the patient was beyond repair.\n"
"“None. The patient’s delusions remain. Demanding to speak with the Warden, claiming they are only guests, and rambling about that play that aired the other night, <u>The King in Yellow</u>.”\n"
"“And their other crimes? The incident in the theatre? What about 1452 Atlantic Ave?”\n"
"“They believe they were attacked, and were defending themselves.” Her voice was thick with pity. What could have caused somebody to snap like this so quickly? None of the patient’s records showed any prior history of mental instability. “Can you make any sense of it, Doctor?”\n"
"“Who could?” Doctor Mintz sighed and stood, grabbing the file from his desk. “My job is not to understand. It is to cure. Perhaps my experimental procedures will prove fruitful on this one.” The nurse winced and felt goosebumps on her arm. She knew how his procedures would turn out, and she doubted it would prove anything."

"“明茨医生，病人吃过药了，现在随时可以开始面诊。”海瑟护士翻开隔壁桌上的文件，看了一下那个病人的病历。\n"
"“病人病情有变化吗？”明茨医生用一成不变的声音问道。这纯粹只是形式，他们二人都知道这个病人是治不好的。\n"
"“没有。病人仍有妄想症状。要求与院长谈话，声称自己只是宾客，还絮絮叨叨地说著那晚上演的戏剧，《黄衣之王》。”\n"
"“还说了其他罪行吗？剧院发生的事件？大西洋街1452号的呢？”\n"
"“病人认为自己遭到袭击并且作出了自卫。”她的声音充满了怜悯。是什么能导致人作出如此迅猛的撕咬动作？这个病人从来没有精神不稳定的病史。“您有头绪吗，医生？”\n"
"“没有。”明茨医生叹气并站起身，拿起桌上的文件。“我的职责是治病，而不是去搞懂病人的想法。或许我的实验疗法会对这种病情有所帮助。”护士的身体不由得退缩，她感觉到手臂上冒出了鸡皮疙瘩。她非常清楚医生所说的疗法是什么，并且十分怀疑那种疗法是否能起到任何的作用。"

Nurse Heather shrieks and retreats, and in the ruckus you are able to escape, bruised and battered but free once more. It will take some time for your wounds to heal, but you have no time for that yet."

msgid "With the asylum staff distracted and patients running amok, you are able to slip away without being noticed. You escape deeper into the garden behind the asylum, where a two-story tall fence topped with barbed wire is all that separates you from the outside world.

Using a straitjacket you’d found inside to cover the barbed wire, you scale the fence quickly, breaking into a run as you make it to the other side."
