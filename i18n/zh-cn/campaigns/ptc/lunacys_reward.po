msgid "The change in the atmosphere has you curious. What if it was all a trick of your mind? What if the hauntings that follow The King in Yellow are but transitory? The answers to all of your questions might lie inside. Cautiously, you open the front door to the manor once again. Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling upon the steering wheel."
msgstr "氛围的转变使你疑惑。这会不会只是你脑海中的错觉？还是说《黄衣之王》紧跟著的鬼影转瞬即逝？你所有问题的答案，可能就在这大宅里面。你小心翼翼地再次打开庄园的前门。随著你步入庄园，令人安心的爵士乐和人们闲聊的嘈杂声愈发响亮。空气中飘来煎烤猪肉的诱人香味。如你所料，你先前所发现的挣扎的迹象和种种怪事都已消失。然后，当你拐进宴会厅时，你发现陌生人正在和另一个男人交谈，他身材高挑，蓄有胡须，一身体面的黑西装，手里拿著银色手柄的手杖。陌生人转向你，他的目光穿透了你的心灵，你的视线痛苦地四处游移。在你意识到这一切之前，你便用尽全力跑了起来，痛觉和不知所踪的方向感使你在门廊处栽倒在地。连喘息的时间都没有，你冲到你的车子上并快速离开，扶在方向盘上的手都是颤抖的。"

msgid "You can’t trust your senses. This is all a trick, an attempt to lure you back inside. You’re no safer now than you were before. Swallowing your fear, you set to work barricading the front door of the manor using several of the heavy stone benches lining the cobblestone path in the front yard. You hope it’s enough, but you aren’t willing to stick around to find out. As soon as you’re done, you head back to your vehicle and drive toward Southside, where you hope to find answers."
msgstr "你无法相信你所感知到的。这就是个圈套，想要引你回到那幢大宅去。你此刻仍处于危险之中。强忍著心头的恐惧，你开始从前庭的鹅卵石路上搬运几个沉甸甸的石凳，将它们堵在庄园的前门上。希望这些足够把门堵住，然而你不愿留在这儿寻找真相。完成这项工作之后，你回到车上，驶向南区，期望你能在那儿找到答案。"

msgid "You dare not risk stepping back inside that madhouse. But you can’t let the monstrosities run amok, either. You root through the open garage for a few supplies, finding an old hose, an empty gasoline canister, and some matches. Knowing what you must do, you first siphon some gas from Mrs. Dumaine’s Oakland 6-54A. You spread the gasoline across the front porch, inside the garage, and around the manor’s outer walls. From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off toward Southside, full of grim determination."
msgstr "你不敢冒险回到那幢疯人院般的大宅中去。但你也不能让那群可怕的家伙肆意杀戮。你在敞著的车库里东翻西找，找到了一些东西：一根旧水管，一个空的汽油罐，还有一些火柴。深知这事儿非做不可，你首先从杜梅因夫人的奥克兰6-54A汽车中抽出一些汽油。你将汽油洒在门廊上、车库内，还在整个庄园的外墙浇了一圈。之后只用几根火柴便可引起一场火灾。你从前厅看著整个庄园最终被大火吞噬。火焰的爆裂声，木头噼噼啪啪地断裂，与人们垂死发出的恐惧尖叫交织在一起，充斥著整条街道。眼前的火势已达到预期，于是你回到车上并向南区驶去，心中只有坚如磐石的决心。"
