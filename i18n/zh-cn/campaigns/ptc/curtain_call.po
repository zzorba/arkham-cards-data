msgstr "冒险I：谢幕"

msgid "You awaken with a start, as though shaken by an unseen force. You must have slept for quite some time, for there are only a few other patrons in the audience, and no performers on stage. The lights are dimmed, and the stage curtains are tattered and ripped, though you do not remember that being the case during the first act. You wait a moment before you are sure this isn’t part of the performance. As you wait, a foul but unrecognizable smell permeates the air. How long have you been asleep? Shaking off your drowsiness, you walk toward one of the seated patrons and ask for the time, but he does not respond. It is then that you realize you are speaking to a corpse."
msgstr "你被一股看不见的力量摇醒了。你肯定是睡了很长一段时间，此时观众席上只剩下几个观众，舞台上也不见表演者的踪影。舞台的幕布破破烂烂，灯光昏暗，但你记不起来在第一幕的时候是否也是这幅景象。你等了好一会才确定这并非演出的一部分。就在你等待的时候，一股难以名状的恶臭在空气中弥漫。你到底睡了多久？你摆脱了困意，向坐在座位上的一个观众走去，问他现在是什么时候，但他没有回答你。此时你意识到你正在对一具尸体说话。"

"Once again you are startled awake, this time by the cold, clammy fingers of a hand on your shoulder. “Are you alright?” an elderly man asks, helping you to your feet. Your mind is a flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t staked a claim on, I tell you.”\n"
"You stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking. “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty— save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost."

"你再次从睡梦中惊醒，这次将你弄醒的是搭在你肩膀上的一只手，它的手指冰冷，又黏又湿。“你还好吗？”一位老人搀扶你起身，关切地问道。你脑海里的记忆十分凌乱。你只记得在最后，沃德剧院已经变成了一个噩梦，里面充斥著危险的狂热信徒和怪异而可怖的东西。你忧心仲仲地环顾周围，发现自己站在剧院外湿滑的路边。尽管早前发生过那些事件，这座城在你眼中并无异常——至少说，这对阿卡姆城来说挺正常的。车灯的强光刺入你的双眼，一辆车开了过来，将航脏的雨水溅到你身旁的人行道上。老人见你的眼中惊恐万分，表情对你十分关切。“你是遭贼了吗？那群惹是生非的坏小子真该死！”他大声骂道：“他们准是在今晚到剧院来为非作歹了！我跟你说，这儿到处都是他们的地盘。”\n"
"你站了起来，走到沃德剧院前门的窗户前，试著往里看看，但因为里面太黑，你什么都看不见。老人好奇地看了你一会，耸了耸肩然后走开了。“好吧，我得走了。我要是你的话我也会早些离开的，”他说完就拐过了街角。你快步跟上，想要提醒他远离剧院。但当你走过转角时，那位老人已经不见踪影，你只见陌生人戴著他那毫无特征的苍白面具，向你投来熟悉的视线。他定定地注视著你。“你是谁？”你大声问道。陌生人没有回答，而是转身离去，消失在剧院后的小巷中。你紧追在后，期望从他口中得到答案，但当你到达小巷时，那里空空如也——除了在剧院员工入口旁边张贴的一张告示，“别扫兴了！ 快来参加《黄衣之王》的庆功派对吧。晚上八点在大西洋街1452号，康斯坦丝·杜梅因的住宅举行派对。请著正装到场。”你从墙上撕下这张告示并且收了起来，心中既沮丧又茫然。"

"Fleeing from the theatre, you head straight to the police station in Easttown. Bursting through the door, to the stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk sergeant, who is lazily working through a stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist, but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice. “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your back as he escorts you out of the station.\n"
"You <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your coat pocket, hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek."

"你逃出剧院之后直奔东城区的警察局。你径直推开警察局的大门，迎著所有旁观者和警员的目光，你说有紧急的事情要见恩格尔警长。值班的警官正懒洋洋地做著手边的文书工作，他摇摇头，抬起一根手指指向旁边的一张椅子，不发一语。你焦灼地等待著。等待的每一秒都如此地漫长。时钟的指针艰难前行。你不耐烦地跺著脚，在桌面上敲敲手指。你不时地回头看，确认戴著苍白面具的陌生人没从前门的窗户上盯著你看。终于，值班警官放下手中的笔，起身并向你招手。“好吧，是什么要紧事？”你向他说明这夜发生的种种事件，还没说完他就叹气摇头。“听著，如果说你在说笑话，这一点都不好笑，”他说：“整晚都有警察在商业区驻守。别想在我面前说胡话。”你坚持想要说服他，但值班警官起身开门，示意让你离开。他拔高了音量：“难不成你觉得我闲得发慌？快走！”他盯著你离开警局，嘴里嘟囔著“蠢货”。\n"
"你<b>知道</b>你今晚所见非虚。你沮丧地回到沃德剧院，希望能找到一些证据带回警局。惊奇的是剧院的大门锁上了。在你决定是否要破门而入的时候，剧院的员工入口旁张贴的一张告示吸引了你的注意力。“别扫兴了！快来参加《黄衣之王》的庆功派对吧。晚上八点在大西洋街1452号，康斯坦丝‧杜梅因的住宅举行派对。请著正装到场。”你撕下告示，将它折好放进外套的口袋里，祈祷它能带领你找到答案。"

"You think about going to the police, but considering the horrors in the theatre, they’re more likely to think you’re mad than to believe your story. A small part of you wonders if this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget. Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior looks the same as it did when you arrived to see The King in Yellow earlier that night. You walk to the front window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\n"
"Just then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\n"
"His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, and instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre.

"你打算上警察局，但考虑到剧院里发生的事情可怕如斯，那帮警察不会相信你所说的，而更可能会认为你是个疯子。在你心底仍抱有些许怀疑，或许那不过是一场恶作剧，但这事儿不一样——这整件事实在过于真实，过于可怕，使你全然无法忘却。你不知所措，谨慎地按照逃出剧院的路线返回。街道上车流穿梭，车头灯的明亮光线刺入你的双眼，将肮脏的雨水溅到你身旁的人行道上。很快，沃德剧院映入你的眼帘，亮堂的灯盏照亮了商业区的街道。你本以为剧院已成废墟，但它看起来跟你今晚早些时候观看《黄衣之王》时别无二致。你走到沃德剧院前门的窗户前，试著往里看看，但因为里面太黑，你什么都看不见。就在这时，一阵寒意掠过你的后颈，你察觉你在被人监视。你一转身，发现有个黑影从街角跑过。一群蟑螂从路上流窜，追随那个黑影的踪迹而去。你的肌肉莫名地绷紧，紧接著你便往街角追去。一个似曾相识的男子站在人行道上，他一副漠不关心的姿态，脸上还戴著一张毫无特征的苍白面具。\n"
