Bones decorate the walls and ceiling around you, open-mouthed skulls peering back at you everywhere you look."

msgid "The contents of Nigel Engram’s home answer none of your questions about The King in Yellow, but do hint at where you should head next. The old, tattered map you found on his coffee table depicts a section of the infamous Catacombs of Paris.

Two wavy lines descend from the design, leading into the skull’s lower jawbone. You recognize it as the pattern Haruko had shown you. Wondering why it would appear here, you examine the skull in greater detail. As soon as you touch the underside of the skull’s jawbone, its mouth suddenly opens. Bones collapse to the ground as the wall slides to reveal a new path."
msgstr "你刚经过一道拱门，看见一个绵羊的头骨上蚀刻著一个熟悉的符号：许多同轴的半圆形成的圆环上排列著奇异的符文。图案下方有两条波纹状的线条，连到头骨的下颚。你认出了这是春子给你看过的图案。你好奇为什么它会出现在这里，于是对著这颗头骨仔细端详起来。你刚刚触碰到下颚骨，它的嘴突然张开了。白骨散落到地上，墙壁滑动，露出了一条新的道路。"

"You are shaken awake by a police officer and lifted to your feet. You feel as though the weight of a train has slammed into your head. The pain is unbearable. The man shines a flashlight in your eyes and asks you several questions in French. Dazed as you are, you find it difficult to answer. He points toward the staircase nearby and pushes you away from the catacombs. You stumble onto the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire and slowly make your way to a hotel where you can stay the night.\n"
"Several days of research later, the meaning of the strange diagrams you saw within the catacombs still escapes you. You feel as though you have been led on a wild goose chase. Just as you are about to give up, you see a faded yellow book on the table nearest to you. You are stunned to discover that it is the unabridged script of The King in Yellow. Drawn on the cover in black ink is the very same diagram whose meaning you have been struggling to interpret for several sleepless nights. Who had placed it here? How had it come to your hotel room? Regardless, you know what you must do. The play holds the secrets—it has all along—and yet like a fool you have avoided reading Act II out of superstition. Its words cannot harm you any more than the creatures and fanatics you have already encountered. Trembling, you open to the second part, and begin to read."

"警察把你摇醒，架了起来。你感觉自己的头好像被火车撞过一样，头疼欲裂。眼前的男子拿著手电筒照了照你的眼睛，并用法语问了你几个问题。你只觉头晕眼花，根本答不上话。他指了指的附近的楼梯，把你推出了地下墓穴。你踉跄著走到伊苏尔墓园大街上，拖著步子回到你住宿的旅店。\n"
"之后几天你一直在研究地下墓穴里的那个奇怪图文的含义，但你一无所获。你开始感觉这是白费力气。就快放弃的时候，你看见桌子上一本褪了色的黄色书本就躺在你手边。你惊讶地发现这是未删节版的《黄衣之王》剧本。书的封面上用黑色墨水画著同样的图文，就是这个图文让你几宿未眠却仍然无法解读。是谁放在这里的？它怎么会到你旅店房间里来的？但撇开这些不谈，你知道现在要做什么了。这部剧中藏著秘密——这个秘密一直就在剧中——而你却像一个傻瓜一样，出于迷信，始终避而不读它的第二幕。它只是文字，它不可能像那些你遇到过的生物和疯子那样伤害你。战栗之下，你翻到书本的第二部分，开始阅读。"

"The burned skull holds the key to everything. You are sure of it. You have tried every method available to you in studying the diagram it bears, but the answer eludes you still. You have brought the skull to experts, occultists, and professors. You have even tried speaking with the skull on more than one occasion. Exasperated, you place the skull on your night table and try to get some sleep for the first time since escaping the catacombs. As you fall asleep, you cannot shake the sight of the diagram etched in the skull’s forehead.\n"
"You awaken with a spark of inspiration and rush to the Musée du Louvre, a famous Parisian museum housing tens of thousands of paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. You spend days exploring the museum—every display, every collection, every single object of art that might hold a clue to the diagram’s meaning. Finally, you see it: a painting depicting a beautiful island town weathering a torrential storm. Waves crash against the stone of the outer wall, the tide threatening to swallow the island whole. Lightning flashes around the tower of the abbey above the village. A whirlwind of black clouds churns in the sky above. The diagram from the burned skull you hold in your hands is recreated perfectly in the stained glass of the abbey. The title of the piece is “The Path Is Open.”"

"这颗烧焦的颅骨里藏著所有的答案。你非常确定。你已经竭尽所能研究了颅骨上的图文，但答案始终是一个谜。你把这颗颅骨带给各界专家、密学家和教授看过。你甚至不止一次尝试与这颗颅骨对话。恼怒之下，你把顾骨放到床头柜上，决定好好睡上一觉，这还是你从地下墓穴出来以后第一次躺下休息。虽然你已入眠，但颅骨前额上蚀刻的图文却仍然徘徊在你眼前。\n"
"突然间，你灵光乍现，赶紧起身赶往罗浮宫，这座坐落在巴黎的著名博物馆里藏有数万件油画、绘画和考古发现。你花费了数日在博物馆中探索——每一件展品， 每一套收藏，每一幅艺术品中都可能藏有关于这个图文涵义的线索。终于你看到了它：这幅油画描绘了暴雨之下一座美丽的小岛。浪涛冲撃著外城墙，潮水随时会把整座岛屿淹没。耀眼的闪电映衬著城镇最高处修道院的塔楼。一道乌云形成的旋风在上空中翻腾。而你手中烧焦颅骨上的图文完美地重现出了修道院彩色玻璃上的图案。这幅作品的标题就叫：“道路终现”。"

"You fall ceaselessly through the empty abyss. No air slows your descent or courses through your hair. It is a passageway devoid of reality. Finally, you pass through an invisible gateway and enter another realm. Looming above and below you are two skylines, one a warped reflection of the other. A vortex of swirling black clouds and crashing waves lies in between them. You study both sides—the familiar city and its strange mirror. Could this be the path to Carcosa? A passageway between realities, where realms converge? If so, all that is left is to find where this gate appears on Earth. You fall into the vortex below.\n"
