"You turn over the folded program in your hand, reading it for what seems like the hundredth time. “Miskatonic Playhouse presents: The King in Yellow,” it reads. “A special one-night engagement at Arkham’s very own Ward Theatre. An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\n"
"To have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\n"
"Finding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\n"
"The lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep."

"你翻开手中折起的节目单，再次阅读彷佛你已读过百遍的这张纸片。“米斯卡塔尼克剧院上演：《黄衣之王》，”纸上这么写著。“阿卡姆本地的沃德剧院将迎来这部戏剧的特别上演，为期一晚。这部令人无法抗拒的戏剧共有两幕。本作品由奈杰尔·英格兰姆负责筹划和管理。本剧演员均属于一个小型剧团，在演员名单最后还有个未署名的人物：“陌生人。”\n"
"这样一部万众期待的戏剧不远万里从巴黎来到阿卡姆，即便只上演一夜它也备受瞩目。在演出前的几个星期里，它一直是城中热话。虽然迹象不甚明显……然而，你有证据证明有某种邪恶势力正在行动。最初是剧院有个舞台工作人员失踪——一个才十七岁的男孩在一次彩排中缺席，之后就再也没人见过他。到距离演出已不到两个星期的时候，一位音乐家被发现死亡，并且尸体口中含著枪。或许最让人生畏的是警察从独立广场抓到的疯汉，他满口胡言乱语，说著“王已归来”之类的疯话。他被带到阿卡姆疯人院之后你惊讶地发现，产生这种妄想的并不止他一人。\n"
"你和你的同伴们经过深入调查之后，发现这些事件十分可疑。尽管无法证实这些事件之间有何关联，而这部即将上演的戏剧周围所发生的离奇事件远不止这些。一椿椿自杀事件和发疯事件接踵而来，你决心要找出背后的真相。\n"
"观众席的灯光暗了下来，聚光灯投下的灯光落在舞台上。眼前的情景与你的预期相去甚远。《黄衣之王》的第一幕缓慢而单调，使人感到无聊乏味。这部戏剧的背景和角色足够吸引，但曲折而怪诞的剧情却未能娱乐观众，也无法传达什么信息。你开始怀疑这些发生在《黄衣之王》周围的骇人事件之间是不是根本就没有联系。或许这不过是你的过度想像；这场平凡而不起眼的演出怎能引起这般混乱？令你吃惊的是第一幕没有任何高潮和转折就骤然结束了。幕间休息时灯光亮起，你忍住哈欠，想要提早离场。你正在踌躇之中，突然感觉自己困意越来越浓……最终昏睡了过去。"

"Act I came and went without a hitch, as it often did in rehearsal. You couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions on many of the audience members’ faces, and you wonder how the audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\n"
"Just then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away— his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black."

"第一幕从演出到结束都未有差错，如同平常彩排的一样。你不由得注意到许多观众脸上空洞而轻蔑的神情，不知观众在观看这部戏剧的下半部分时，会对令人烦厌的剧情作何反应。卡西露达这个角色在戏剧的前半部分实在令人厌倦，尽管她的王家气度使你在扮演时乐在其中。你心中泛起对前搭档米里亚姆·吐温的怀念，突然间，你在巴黎时的恐惧和悲悼之情又涌上心头。你听见舞台工作人员开始为接下来的布景做准备，你叹了口气，闪身躲到后台的漆黑角落，好避开人群。你试图让你的情绪平定下来，将你的思绪代入卡西露达——她的希望，她的恐惧，她的命运。\n"
"就在此时，你惊觉陌生人正从远处盯著你看，仅短短一瞥就使你胆颤心惊。尽管他们在每场演出之前都会改换陌生人的扮演者(实际上在彩排时也发生过多次)，但你知道，在这紧要关头换上的扮演者比过往的都要可怕得多。你意识到你从未得知他的名字，一阵恐惧的战栗爬上你的后脊。你像是只迷路的羔羊，懵然步向狼群……你无法将目光从他身上移开——他的双眼紧盯著你。然后你眼前一黑。"
