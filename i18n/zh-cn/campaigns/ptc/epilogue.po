"It has taken months of preparation, but you are finally ready to unveil your latest work to the world. Gathering financial investments was your first task, of course. That hadn’t taken too long given the connections you’d made during your stay in Paris. You have been assured that the cast assembled is the finest that money could afford, but still you strive to make everything perfect. It must be perfect. The story must be told, so that the world knows. You’ve heard the troupe whisper behind your back: the remarks about your bizarre passion, the concern about your piercing yellow eyes. It matters not to you. All you care about is the performance. The pronunciation of the words. The melody of Cassilda’s song. The design of the Stranger’s mask.\n"
"This would be the greatest performance of <u>The King in Yellow</u> ever."

"准备工作花费了好几个月，但你终于能揭开最后一道面纱，把你最新的作品呈现给世人。吸收金融投资当然是你的第一要务。得益于你在巴黎逗留期间结识的广博人脉，这并没有花费你很多时间。你相信重资聘来的这批演员是最出色的班底，但你仍然要竭尽全力把一切做到尽善尽美。这出戏必须完美无瑕。必须要让全世界都知道这个故事。虽然你也听到戏班子在你身后的闲言碎语：说你的激情透著古怪，说你黄色的眼睛能刺透人心。但这些对你都不重要。你只关心这次演出，关心每一个字的发音，关心卡西露达歌声的旋律，关心陌生人面具的设计。\n"
"这一次的《黄衣之王》一定会成为史上最成功的演出。"
