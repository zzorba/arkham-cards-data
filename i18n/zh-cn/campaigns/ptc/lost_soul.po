"You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House and hide Daniel from the authorities, although you’re unsure how long you’ll be able to stay in Arkham with an escaped asylum patient. Daniel is a loose cannon, dazed and unresponsive one moment, and screaming for his life the next. It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”\n"
"Hours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts, mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that he has been choked to death."

"你打算在老马旅社避避风头，藏匿丹尼尔并且躲过当局追捕，尽管你也不知道你能带著一名出逃的精神病人在阿卡姆待多久。丹尼尔是个不受控制的危险人物，他一会儿双目茫然，毫无反应，一会儿又情绪激动，拼了命地大喊大叫。他过了好几天才明白，自己不会再被送进精神病院了，但出于某些原因，这使他更加恐惧。“他会来找我的，他会来找我的！”他絮絮叨叨，有时一念叨就是好几个小时。最后，在一个异常温暖而漫天星光的夜里，丹尼尔十分冷静，向你打开话匣。“黄衣之王，不仅仅是一部戏剧，”他解释道，“那是一个名叫'哈斯塔'的存在，而现在他要带走我了。但你还有时间。你还没被附身。你还没有说出誓约。无论你要做什么，千万别说出他的名字。不要屈服。”你向他问到城里发生的怪异事件。还有你遭遇的邪教徒和生物。“他们都想找到卡尔克萨，”他坦然说道。你认出这个名字正是戏剧中黄衣之王所统治的虚构城市。“他们想要将哈斯塔从他的囚禁之地释放出来。但你！——你可以在他们之前开启通往卡尔克萨的道路！你可以永远地封印哈斯塔！”他咆哮著紧紧地抓住你，“快，赶在陌生人发现你的计划之前！”\n"
"几个小时之后，丹尼尔又变得语无伦次，反应迟纯。你出门散了很久的步，想让自己的大脑放轻松，将新吸收的信息细嚼慢咽。你不知应该对他疯狂的言论作何理解。你无法决定下一步该怎么做，于是返回住所，却发现自己房间的门遭到破坏，敞开著。丹尼尔躺在地上一动不动，面色苍白。从他脖子上的淤青看来，你推测他是窒息致死的。"

msgid "You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House, unsure whether news of the events at the asylum will get out to the general public. You take this time to make extensive notes of the events you’ve experienced thus far, including the brief dialogue between you and Daniel. He’d spoke of The King in Yellow as if it were an actual being, and even named it. “Hastur.” He’d rambled and muttered and screeched other phrases, as well. You doubt you’ll ever forget them. “He made us speak the Oath.” “The price was paid.” “They are opening the path to Carcosa.” For hours, you think about Daniel’s warning to you, which he begged you to heed: “Do not speak His name.” His final moments play out in your mind over and over again."
msgstr "你打算先在老马旅社避避风头，毕竟你不知道疯人院里发生的事件是否已经传扬开来。正好利用这段时间把你迄今所经历的事件，还有与丹尼尔的短暂谈话都记录下来。他说起黄衣之王的时候彷佛那是真实的存在，甚至说出了他的名字。“哈斯塔。”他来回踱步，口中念念有词，还尖声喊著其他的短句。他所说的话或许你永远都无法忘记。“他强迫我们发下了誓约。”“已经付出了代价。”“他们将要开启通往卡尔克萨的路。”在几个小时里你都在思考丹尼尔的警告，他当时恳求你听他一言：“别说出他的名字。”他临终的画面一遍又一遍地在你的脑海中重现。"

"On the third night, you return to your room to find the door broken open. You enter cautiously, wondering if the police are onto you. Or worse, the Stranger. You are surprised to find the body of Daniel Chesterfield instead, lying on the ground with a pained, wide-eyed expression on his face. He is dead. His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n"
"<center><fancy>[elder_sign]Carcosa is real</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>Do not let them open the path</fancy></center>\n"
"When Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:\n"
"<center><fancy>Hastur is the king in tatters</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>locked in his prison in the stars</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>seal him away and stop this madness!</fancy></center>\n"
"Your mind swims with questions. How did he escape the asylum? How did he die? And why does he appear human to your eyes now? With little time to spare, you clean the room of your belongings and flee. Daniel’s words, which he begged you to heed, play out in your mind over and over again."

"在第三天夜里，你回到房间时发现房门遭到破坏，敞开著。你小心翼翼地进屋，想知道是不是警察找上门来了。或者情况更糟，找上门来的是陌生人。让你吃惊的是，房间里等待著你的是丹尼尔的尸体，他躺在地板上，脸上挂著痛苦的神情，双目大睁。他死了。他的双眼满布血丝，呈现黄色，僵硬的手中紧握著一本《黄衣之王》。你掰开他的手指，把他死死握住的手册拿了出来，查看手册的内容。丹尼尔在每页的空白处潦草地写下了一些文字，大部分都难以理解，一部分清晰地作了强调。在初次提到卡尔克萨这座虚构城市时，丹尼尔在旁边滚草地写著：\n"
"<center><fancy>[elder_sign]卡尔克萨是真的</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>不要让他们开启道路</fancy></center>\n"
"当卡西露达谈到褴褛之王时，丹尼尔写著：\n"
"<center><fancy>哈斯塔是身披褴褛的王</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>被囚禁在群星之间的牢狱中</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>将他封印起来并且阻止疯狂延绩下去！</fancy></center>\n"
"你满脑子都是问号。他是怎么逃出疯人院的？他又是怎么死去的？为什么他以人形出现在你眼前？无暇多顾，你把自己的东西从房间里清理干净，逃离此地。丹尼尔给你留下的字句，传达了他恳切的忠告，一遍又一遍地在你的脑海中重现。"

msgstr "在过去的几个小时里，你因为得悉黄衣之王的存在而苦苦挣扎。什么是正确？什么又是真实？只有你能看透这疯狂。"
