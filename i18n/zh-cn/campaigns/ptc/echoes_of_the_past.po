"Your head throbs with a dull ache as you drive through the rainy streets of Arkham toward your next destination. The threat of the Stranger looms in your mind, and you find yourself glancing often at your rear-view mirror, expecting to see the expressionless visage of his mask haunting you. Instead, you see nothing but the misty, starless night, and the deserted road behind you.\n"
"Your thoughts once again wander, as they have often in the past few hours, to The King in Yellow and to the city of Carcosa and its inhabitants. What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of The King in Yellow was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed by the same man: Nigel Engram.\n"
"There is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occuring within the city: the Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of The King in Yellow, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the questions that burn in your mind."

"当你驾车从阿卡姆城雨中的街道开过，前往下一个目的地时，你的脑袋隐隐作痛。“陌生人”的威胁时而在你的脑海中浮现，你不由得时常看后视镜，以为镜中会出现那个男子，面戴毫无表情的面具，阴魂不散。相反，你从镜中只看见雾蒙蒙的夜空，天上没有星星，街道也空无一人。\n"
"如同过去的几小时一样，你的思绪再次飘到《黄衣之王》，还有卡尔克萨和城中的居民。那部可怕的戏剧里潜藏著什么信息，它疯狂的剧情又意味著什么？最先占据你的思绪的是一个细节信息，这是你在杜梅因夫人的住处偶然听到的——今晚的《黄衣之王》演出并不是第一出出现在阿卡姆城的邪恶戏剧。至少曾经还有另一场演出，均由同一个人执导：奈杰尔·英格兰姆。\n"
"城中有个地方，阿卡姆城中所发生的重大事件都会保存于此：历史协会，位于南区的一幢宅邸。如果之前上演的《黄衣之王》留下了任何记录，那或许就保存在历史协会。或许所有困扰你的问题都能够在那儿找到答案。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. <i>If Sebastien Moreau is listed under VIPs Interviewed</i>:"
msgstr "查看冒险日志。<i>如果在贵宾会谈下方记录有塞巴斯蒂安‧莫罗</i>："

msgid "You recall what Sebastien told you during the dinner party. The King in Yellow had come to Arkham several decades ago, long before the Ward Theatre was built. According to him, it isn’t surprising that few people remember—in fact, part of their goal tonight was to bring The King in Yellow to a wider audience. The Historical Society may have kept records pertaining to this earlier production, especially if it was followed by events similar to what has occurred tonight. Perhaps you can find some newspaper clippings or other articles describing what happened in the past."
msgstr "你想起塞巴斯蒂安在晚宴上对你说的话。数十年前，早在沃德剧院建成之前《黄衣之王》就曾在阿卡姆上演。据他所说，没什么人记得这件事也不足为奇——事实上，他们今晚的目标是将《黄衣之王》呈献给更多的观众。历史协会可能保留有与上一版演出相关的记录，况且那场演出之后也发生了种种事件，与今晚发生的事件相似。或许你可以找到一些剪报或其他文章，记载著过去发生的事情。"

It seems he was admitted to the asylum after the production ended. Perhaps he’s still there…"
msgstr "《黄衣之王》事件中出现了这件东西，那一定不是偶然。你心中笃信，你发现的东西十分重要，于是你决定在之后的调查中带上它。你找到的最近一份有关《黄衣之王》早年演出的记录，是丹尼尔‧契斯特菲尔德的精神评估报告，他是一名舞台工作人员，在最后一场演出结束后失去理智。他似乎在演出结束之后就被送进了疯人院，或许他现在还在那儿……"

msgid "This investigation would make anybody paranoid. Attributing some greater meaning to everything you find can be a dangerous proposition. You’re sure that this clasp is meaningless, perhaps even a prop from the original play. You leave it behind and continue your investigation. The last record you find related to the original production of The King in Yellow is a psychiatric evaluation of one Daniel Chesterfield, a stagehand who lost his wits after the final show. It seems he was admitted to the asylum after the production ended. Perhaps he’s still there…"
msgstr "本次调查会让人陷入偏执。你发觉从这一切归结出某个更深层的意义可能会招致危险，你认为这个扣环没什么意义，可能不过是那场早年演出的一个道具。你将它放回原位，并且继续进行调查。你找到的最近一份有关《黄衣之王》早年演出的记录，是丹尼尔‧契斯特菲尔德的精神评估报告，他是一名舞台工作人员，在最后一场演出结束后失去理智。他似乎在演出结束之后就被送进了疯人院。或许他还在那儿……"

msgid "The figure collapses to the ground, its warped, melting body writhing in agony. It wheezes and cries out, a yellow glow emanating from inside its mouth and behind its eyes. “Daniel,” the thing says in its cracking voice. “Seek Daniel… Daniel Chesterfield, the stagehand, he remembers!” Deep inside the man’s words, there is another voice behind it, whispering faintly in a melodic language. “Find him… He too has spoken the oath… The oath that doomed us all…!” With those final words, the skin melts off the man’s bones, and he rattles to the floor."
msgstr "那个人影瘫倒在地，它的躯体如同遭受熔解一般，痛苦地扭曲成异常的姿态。它大口喘息，尖叫连连，黄色的光芒从他的嘴巴和眼眶中射出。“丹尼尔，” 它用沙哑的声音说道。“找到丹尼尔……丹尼尔‧契斯特菲尔德，那个舞台工作人员，他还记得！”就在那名男子的话语背后，潜蔵著另一个声音，以一种带有韵律的语言发出微弱的低语：“找到他……他也宣读了誓约……那个誓约毁了我们全部人……！”就在他说出最后几个字的时候，他的皮肉从骨头上熔化，哗啦散落一地。"

"The night’s events have left you exhausted. You were unable to learn anything at the Historical Society’s manor that could drive your investigation forward. Whoever those intruders were, they must have been looking for the same information you were. Distraught, you find your way to the closest bed you can find—in Ma’s Boarding House, not too far from the Historical Society. Dawn breaks as you reach the boarding house, the front doorknob and ferns on the porch covered in dew. You are lucky enough to get a vacant room for the day, and soon you are fast asleep.\n"
"Suddenly, you are falling. Above and all around you, a blinding radiance flares like an inferno. Your head twinges with pain and your vision swims with brilliant colors. Your skin is singed by the flames. Below you, the abyss opens and swallows you whole. You then find yourself in a dank, windowless cell, filled with a putrid stench. A man is huddled in a corner of the room, shivering from the cold, or from the hopelessness of his situation, or perhaps both. “No mask,” he mutters over and over, “no mask, no mask…” You take a few tentative steps forward, but before you can reach him, the metal slot on his cell door slides open, and you hear an orderly call to him. “Daniel, it’s time,” he says. “Daniel, wake up. Wake up, Daniel.” Then, you awaken."

"今晚发生的事情让你筋疲力竭。你在历史协会这幢宅邸里一无所获，调查进度停滞不前。不论那群入侵者是谁，他们要寻找的东西肯定与你要找的一样。你心烦意乱。只想就近找张床铺躺下——好在老马旅社和历史协会相距不远。你抵达旅社的时候天已破晓，前门的把手和门廊前的羊齿草上都挂著晨露。幸运的是今天正好有个空房间供你入住，随后你很快便沉沉睡去。\n"
"突然你整个人在下坠。在你的上方和周围，闪耀著地狱之火般的光芒，让你目不能视。你头痛难当，视线游移，眼前尽是流光溢彩。你的皮肉被火焰烧焦。一张深渊巨口在你下方张开，将你整个人吞了进去。随后你发觉自己身处在一个潮湿的小房间里，没有窗户，一股腐败的恶臭味充斥著这里。一个男人在房间的角落里瑟瑟发抖，不知是因为寒冷而战栗，还是说是因为对他的处境无望，或者两者皆有。“不要面具，”他嘟囔了一遍又一遍，“不要面具，不要面具……”你试探性地向前走了几步，就在你接近他之前，他的房门上的金属插槽滑开了，随后你听见一个护工对他说话。“丹尼尔，时间到了，”他说道，“丹尼尔，醒醒。给我醒醒，丹尼尔。”然后，你苏醒了。"
