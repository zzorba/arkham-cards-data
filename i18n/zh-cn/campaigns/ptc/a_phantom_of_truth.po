"Several months have passed since The King in Yellow came to the Ward Theatre. You and your companions have been investigating the strange incidents that followed in its wake. What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail… And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\n"
"You’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

"自从《黄衣之王》在沃德剧院上演以来，过去了几个月。你和你的同伴一直在调查在那之后发生的怪异事件。你的发现让你开始质疑是否调查还要继续，但真相在呼唤著你，让你欲罢不能。而且似乎你也不是第一批拼凑出围绕《黄衣之王》的怪异事件的人。还有一批调查员此前也曾调查过类似事件。但这部剧在阿卡姆上演后没几天，他们就被送进了疯人院，据了解，他们被送进去时大声吼著王的归来，还有攻击他们的“怪物”。这个发现并未出乎你的意料。他们的下场让你更加确信，你调查的方向非常正确……但也让你更加确信，你应该马上收手。\n"
"你找到了那些调查员在被抓去之前留下的记录，并一路继续追查。他们曾访问《黄衣之王》的演职人员，并且发现了一些至关重要的信息。他们的调查笔记中也提到了阿卡姆的历史协会，还详细描述了他们的疯人院里的经历，包括与一个名为“丹尼尔‧契斯特菲尔德”的病人的交流。你秉烛对笔记进行编录和比较，经过漫长的一夜，你沉沉睡去。在梦中，你进入了卡尔克萨——你看到了它黑色的星辰、双生的太阳、破碎的月球，和扭曲的尖柱。"

msgid "It has been several weeks since the events in the asylum, and you are still no closer to the truth about The King in Yellow and Carcosa. You have scoured the city for signs of the others Daniel had mentioned—the ones who are “opening the path to Carcosa”—but found nothing. Either the trail has gone cold, or they’re no longer in Arkham. Perhaps Daniel truly was insane, and you are only following him deeper down the rabbit hole. Every night, you toss and turn as you are subjected to vivid dreams of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."
msgstr "自从疯人院事件以来，已经过去了几个星期，但你离《黄衣之王》和卡尔克萨的真相没有丝毫进展。你在全城搜找丹尼尔提到的其他线索——那群想要“开启通往卡尔克萨的路的人”——但结果一无所获。不是这条线索已经断了线，就是这批人已经离开了阿卡姆。当然丹尼尔也可能真的疯了，你只是被他牵著陷入了一个死局。每一晚，你都辗转反侧，在一道道鲜活的梦境中，你看到了卡尔克萨——它黑色的星辰、双生的太阳、破碎的月球，和扭曲的尖柱。"

msgid "You chase the Stranger through dark, chilly passageways composed of hundreds of thousands of skeletal bodies. Skulls watch as you run, their mouths rattling a mocking taunt as you pass. The Stranger reaches a solid wall of bone, and is grabbed by bony hands and pulled into the wall. Their mocking laughs reach an awful crescendo."
msgstr "你追著陌生人，走进了一条通道，这条通道由几十万具骷髅包裹而成，黑暗而阴冷。你往前奔跑时，颅骨齐刷刷地看著你，它们的上下颌碰撞著向你发出嘲讽的声音。陌生人来到一堵白骨堆成的实墙面前，一群只剩白骨的手臂抓住了他，把他拖进了墙壁之中，他们可恶的嘲笑响彻整个通道。"

msgid "You find yourself inside the Arkham Police Department, desperately trying to explain to the desk sergeant what happened in the Ward Theatre. He scoffs and refuses to believe you. “We know what you’re really up to,” he says, and claps a pair of handcuffs over your wrists. “You’re under arrest for larceny. Boys, take ‘em away.” Several other cops flank you and prevent any escape. Your protests go unheard as you are firmly escorted down a flight of concrete stairs and hurled into a cold jail cell. “Maybe some time in lockup will change your story,” the desk sergeant shouts. He slams the door behind him, leaving you with your spiraling thoughts. How did they find out? How could they possibly know?"
msgstr "你突然发现自己身处阿卡姆警署，拼命在向接待警员解释沃德剧院里发生的事情。他却对你嗤之以鼻，根本不相信你的话。“我们知道你干了什么，”说著，他掏出一副手铐就铐在了你的手腕上。“你因盗窃罪被捕了。来人，给我带走。”其他几个警察从四面八方包围了你，以防你逃脱。你的抗议如石沉大海，警察死死抓住你，把你拖下一条混凝土的楼梯，扔进了一间冰冷的牢房。“也许关一段时间你就改口了。”那个接待人员吼道。他砰的一下关上了门，留下你一个人思绪万千。他们怎么会发现的？他们怎么可能知道？"

A vortex of swirling black clouds looms above you, threatening to swallow the world whole. The masked man dashes through a wide set of doors atop the stairs, and you follow close behind. The sound of crashing thunder is muffled as the doors close behind you. Looking up, you see a familiar depiction in stained glass. “Beautiful, is it not?” the Stranger says quietly."
msgstr "你追著陌生人，走上了一条残破石块堆砌的陡峭楼梯，一路上暴雨如注，倾泻在你的背上。远方的天空闪著雷电。你头顶的乌云聚成了一个旋涡，随时准备把整个世界都吞入其中，戴著面具的男子一个箭步窜进了楼梯顶一扇宽阔的大门，你紧紧追随。你身后的门关上后，轰鸣的雷声也轻了许多。你一抬头，看见彩色玻璃上绘著一个熟悉的图画。“很漂亮，不是吗？”陌生人轻轻说道。"

msgstr "“啊，这不是我们尊敬的客人嘛，”留著两撇小胡子的男子柱著银柄手杖说道。他从一旁的厨房台面上抓过一瓶红酒，给你倒了一杯。“我听说你对我们小小的剧作很有兴趣，”他微微一笑，“告诉我，就现在来看，你觉得第二幕还不错吧？”"

msgstr "剧院的灯光暗了下来，一道聚光灯打在了舞台上。“欢迎，女士们，先生们！”那个生物大声说道。它的众多触手翻过舞台，爬上屋梁，穿过通道。它撕下幕布，破烂的红布落了下来，盖住了它球根状的身形。"

The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret his cryptic comments.
