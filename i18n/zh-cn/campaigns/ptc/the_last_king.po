msgid "The brisk autumn air embraces you as you exit the manor. There is no doubt in your mind that the cast and crew of The King in Yellow have become affected by madness. Perhaps it’s getting to you, as well. You feel an encroaching darkness, a presence in your mind not unlike the gaze of the Stranger. Startled, you peer about the front yard for the first time since escaping the manor. The scene is…different. The front windows are not smashed as they were when you first approached. The trail of blood you had noticed on the porch has been wiped clean, and instead of the disturbingly warped music you had heard upon entering, the soothing tones of slow jazz drift out from the courtyard."
msgstr "當你離開這個莊園時，凜冽的秋風向你襲來。你心中確信無疑，《黃衣之王》的演職人員都被瘋狂所影響。或許這也將發生在你的身上。你感覺到一股黑暗逐漸滲入，陌生人的凝視彷彿滲入你的腦海中。驚懼之下，你逃出莊園之後首次細看前院。景像……不同了。與你第一次到來時不同，前窗並未破碎。你在門廊發現的血跡已被抹淨，與你在進入這幢建築時聽到的令人不安的扭曲的音樂不同，此時從庭院傳來的是輕柔而舒緩的爵士樂曲調。"

"“Excuse me, but it’s very late,” you hear a server say as he gently taps you on your shoulder. You realize that you are sitting on a couch in the manor’s living room, and that you have been asleep for some time. The party appears to be winding down. No music fills the halls, the food is all but gone, and only a few guests remain. “Perhaps you would like for me to get your coat?” the server asks with a trained smile. You wobble as you rise to your feet, leaning against the couch’s armrest. Your head pounds with a dizzying intensity, and your vision is spotted. You insist that you are fine, and begin walking toward the foyer.\n"
"You no longer see any of the guests you were searching for earlier, not even the hostess, Mrs. Dumaine. All traces of the madness and horror you’ve experienced are gone. Even the oddities you witnessed upon entering the manor have vanished—the signs of struggle, the broken windows, the blood trail on the porch… Every piece of evidence has been erased. But you still remember the night’s events, and in your memory you will find your answers."

"“请您原谅我的冒犯，但现在时间已经很晚了。”一位侍者轻拍你的肩膀，对你说道。你发觉你身处这座庄园的客厅，坐在沙发上睡著了一阵子。派对似乎已进入尾声。各个礼堂都没有乐声环绕，佳肴消失一空，只有少数几个宾客逗留在此。“或许您需要我给您取来外套？”侍者脸上露出职业微笑，问道。你倚靠著沙发扶手，双腿颤颤巍巍地站起身来。你的大脑彷佛受到重击，使你头晕目眩，眼前的景像模糊不清。你坚称自己无恙，然后向门厅走去。\n"
"先前你寻找的宾客已消失踪影，女主人杜梅因夫人也不见了。你所经历过的疯狂和恐怖景像已无迹可寻。你进入庄园时目睹的怪事也悉数消失——挣扎的迹象，破碎的窗户，门廊的血迹……所有的证据都被抹消了。但你仍记得这夜发生的事情，你会在记忆中找到你要的答案。"

msgid "Several days later, you find yourself reminiscing about the party you attended at 1452 Atlantic Avenue. What a roaring good time you had! And yet, your memory is hazy. You can’t help but feel you are forgetting something important. Something about the play you’d watched earlier that night—The King in Yellow. That nagging sensation pursues you in every waking moment. Try as you might to recall the night’s events in full, there remains a gaping hole in your memory. As you strain to remember, your concern grows, almost to the point of obsession. Deciding that you absolutely must know what occurred that night, you head toward the manor of the Historical Society in Southside. Perhaps there you can learn more about <u>The King in Yellow</u> play…"
msgstr "几天过去后，你回想起你在大西洋街1452号参加过的派对。那晚你玩得真痛快！然而，你的记忆却是模糊的。你不禁感觉到，你忘记了一些重要的事情。与你在那晚早些时候观看的戏剧《黄衣之王》有关。在你清醒的每个时刻，这种困惑的想法挥散不去，使你不得安宁。你试图回想起那晚发生的所有事情，然而你的记忆却仍有一大段空白。随著你尽力地回想，你对此事愈发专注，几乎到了沉迷的程度。你必须知道那晚究竟发生了什么，于是你出发前往南区的那所庄园——历史协会。或许在那儿你会得知更多有关《黄衣之王》这部戏剧的信息……"
