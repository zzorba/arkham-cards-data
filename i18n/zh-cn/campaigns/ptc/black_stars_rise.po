msgid "Scenario VII: Black Stars Rise"
msgstr "冒险VII：黑星升起"

msgid "The island commune of Mont Saint-Michel lies off the northwestern coast of France. It is beautiful, elegant, and enigmatic—a place out of a fairy tale. Only this tale is one of horrors and madness. During low tide, you would be able to reach the island on foot by crossing the tidal causeway that emerges from the sea. However, by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much higher than you’d anticipated. Dark clouds cover the sky, and a distant crash of thunder signals the start of the oncoming storm. You find a boat whose captain is willing to take you to the island, and prepare for the ritual to come."
msgstr "圣米歇尔山所在的岛屿就坐落在法国西北部的海岸线上。这里风景优雅而又神秘莫测——宛若神话中的仙境。只不过，这是一个恐怖而疯狂的神话。低潮时，你可以从海中露出的堤道步行走到岛上。可惜你到达海边时，潮水比你预期的要高出许多。空中乌云密布，远处传来的隆隆雷声预示著暴风雨即将来临。你找到一艘船，船长愿意载你上岛，而你也准备好面对即将到来的仪式。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. <i>If Ashleigh Clarke is listed under VIPs Interviewed</i>:"
msgstr "查看冒险日志。<i>如果在“贵宾会谈”下方记录有阿什莉·克拉克</i>："

msgid "You recall the night where this all began, and your thoughts drift to the mesmerizing song Ashleigh sang that night. Somehow you remember the lyrics perfectly after all this time, and its haunting melody is ingrained in your mind. “Above the city the storm clouds rage, and waves crash through the gilded cage… Below the earth the salt water seeps, the shadows fall as the red sun sleeps…” Studying the island that lies before you, illuminated by flashes of lighting and assaulted by tumultuous waves, you can’t help but wonder if Ashleigh was singing about this very moment."
msgstr "你回忆起一切开始的那个夜晚，你的思绪也飘向阿什莉那晚唱的迷人歌曲。虽然过了那么久，你却还能清晰地记起每一句歌词，而那个难以忘怀的旋律也已深深植入你的脑海。“城上雷云嚣哗，浪碎鎏金囚枷……碧水穿地涌浃，赤日西枕暗霞……”你端详著眼前的岛屿，在闪电和巨浪的侵袭之下，你不禁好奇，阿什莉唱的是不是就是眼前的这一刻。"

No rain pelts the glass of the windows above, and you hear no thunder, nor the screeching of winged horrors overhead. Somehow, you had escaped the island’s certain doom. You creep to the door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block the glare of two suns. You stand overlooking the Lake of Hali. Black stars hang in the heavens above. Beyond, over leagues of tossing cloud- waves, the towers of Carcosa rise behind the shattered moon."
msgstr "你醒来时，发现自己坐在圣米歇尔山修道院的哥特式唱诗台上。没有雨点打在头顶的玻璃窗上，也听不到雷鸣和空中飞行骇物的尖叫。你莫名其妙就躲过了小岛注定的噩运。你爬向修道院的大门，颤颤巍巍推开了门。刺眼的阳光烧灼著你的双眼，你抬起手，遮蔽双生太阳的眩目强光。你站起身，俯瞰著哈利湖。黑星高悬在头顶的穹窿之上。在远方，在连绵起伏的翻腾云浪之外，卡尔克萨的尖塔从破碎的月球后方冉冉升起。"
