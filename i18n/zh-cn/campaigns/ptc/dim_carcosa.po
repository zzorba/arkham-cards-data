msgid "Scenario VIII"
msgstr "冒险VIII"

msgid "You swim to the edge of the water and throw yourself upon the rocky shore, gasping for air. You lie there for some time, utterly exhausted. Every muscle in your body aches. Before you lies a desolate expanse of plain. In the distance, the alien spires of a warped city rise into the clouds. Behind you, the dark surface of the lake from which you’d emerged reflects the glare of two suns. When you peer back into the murky depths, you see no sign of the chapel where you’d made the leap, or of Mont Saint-Michel, or even of Earth. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."
msgstr "你游到水边，奋力跃上岸边的岩石，大口喘著气。你躺下休息了一会儿，感觉精力完全被榨干了。身上每一块肌肉都在酸痛。你的眼前是一望无际的荒芜平原。远处异界的尖柱从扭曲的城中直插云霄。在你身后是你刚刚破水而出的湖泊，黑色的湖面倒映著两个耀眼的太阳。你回头望向晦暗的湖底，刚才你跳跃时立足的礼拜堂已然看不到一丝痕迹，而圣米歇尔山，甚至地球，也都见不到丝毫踪影。这就是卡尔克萨——众星之中的疯狂国度，哈斯塔的至高领域。"

msgid "You land on a piece of black obsidian stone winding up a dark spire. You cough blood and feel a searing pain in your gut, as though you’d broken a rib. Before you lies a warped, alien city. Its twisting streets and aberrant architecture have no semblance of order or structure. In the distance, a murky lake reflects the glare of two suns. When you look up, the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel peeks just below the clouds, flipped upside-down. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."
msgstr "你掉落到一片黑色尖柱上，柱顶为蜿蜒盘旋的黑曜石。你只觉体内一阵剧痛，好像肋骨都被刺裂了一般，咳出了鲜血。你的眼前是歪折的怪异都市。那些扭曲的街道和反常的建筑物毫无规则和结构可言。在远处，一片晦暗的湖泊倒映著两个耀眼的太阳。你抬头望去，圣米歇尔山上的修道院在上下倒错的云层中若隐若现。这就是卡尔克萨——众星之中的疯狂国度，哈斯塔的至高领域。"

You can scarcely bring yourself to look at it. You remember everything now—how it all began, how it ended, and everything in between. There is only one thing left to do. You hurl the mask into the air with all of your strength and watch as it flies into the tempest-tossed waves below."

"A roar of applause startles you awake. The crowd of the theatre rises to their feet, cheering endlessly. Several patrons in the front row are throwing roses to the actors on stage, who are bowing with wide smiles across their faces. A searing headache crawls through your temples. How did you get back here? Were you in the theatre all along? What about the dinner party? The asylum? The catacombs?… Carcosa? Was it all just a terrible dream?\n"
"You exit the auditorium before the crowd rushes to do the same. Dizziness and exhaustion harries your senses. The weight of your lengthy investigation is crushing your mind. By the time you finally reach the lobby, you are clawing your way across the ground. Just then, a man in an elegant suit reaches down and grabs you by your arm, pulling you to your feet. You are about to thank him when you realize who he is. The sight of him causes you to stagger backward in horror momentarily. The actor who plays the role of the Stranger is still wearing his pale, featureless mask. He gives you a wordless bow, then turns and leaves through the Ward Theatre’s front entrance."

"雷鸣般的掌声惊醒了你。剧院的观众都起立驻足，他们在一个劲地喝彩。前排的几个观众朝台上的演员抛去玫瑰花，演员们的脸上绽放著会心的微笑，鞠躬致意。一阵剧烈的头疼爬上了你的太阳穴。你怎么会回到这里的？难道你一直就在剧院里？今天的晚宴怎么了？还有疯人院？地下墓穴？……卡尔克萨？这一切难道只是一场噩梦？\n"
"你赶在人流退场之前，离开了观众席。眩晕和疲惫侵扰著你的感官。你漫长的调查经历己经压垮了你的精神。等你终于到达前厅时，你已经在地上匍匐爬行了。就在这时，一个身著优雅西服的男子弯下腰，挽住了你的手臂，把你拉起了身。你正准备感谢他，却突然意识到他是谁。和他一打照面，你就惊恐地连连后退。这个扮演陌生人一角的演员还戴著他苍白而面无表情的面具。他一语不发地向你鞠了一躬，旋即走出了沃德剧院的正门。"

"When you awaken, you are sitting in the choeur gothique of Mont Saint-Michel’s abbey. No rain pelts the glass of the windows above, and you hear no thunder, nor the screeching of winged horrors overhead. Somehow, you have escaped. You creep to the door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block the glare of the sun. You stand overlooking beautiful Mont Saint-Michel. Seagulls fly over the abbey under a backdrop of cloudless sky. The waters around the abbey are calm and azure-blue.\n"
"“I’ve been looking all over for you!” You hear a voice exclaim behind you. You turn with a startle. For a moment you expect to see the Stranger and his Pallid Mask, but instead, the boat captain you’d hired to take you to Mont Saint-Michel stands at the edge of the steps, smiling at you. “Are you ready to head back?”"

"你醒来时，发现自己坐在圣米歇尔山修道院的哥特式唱诗台上。没有雨点打在头顶的玻璃窗上，也听不到雷鸣和空中飞行骇物的尖叫。你莫名其妙就躲过一劫。你爬向修道院的大门，颤颤巍巍推开了门。刺眼的的阳光烧灼著你的双眼，你抬起手，遮蔽太阳的光照。你站起身俯瞰著美丽的圣米歇尔山。万里晴空之下，海鸥在修道院上方飞翔。修道院周围的海碧蓝通透，水波不惊。\n"
"“我一直在到处找你！”你听到身后有人在呼唤你。你惊讶地扭头一看。恍惚之间，你还以为会看到陌生人和他的苍白面具，但那只是你雇佣带你来圣米歇尔山的船长，他站在台阶一边，冲著你微笑：“你准备回去了吗？”"

They are resigned to their hideous fate, but still you try day after day to bring them your message. You must warn them of The King in Yellow, of Hastur and of Carcosa. “Another lost soul,” they say, but they cannot possibly fathom what you have gone through in your attempt to save them.
