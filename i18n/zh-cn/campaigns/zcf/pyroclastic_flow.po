msgid "Scenario VII: Pyroclastic Flow"

msgid ""
"With the cult's destination known, you scour the Singapore harbor for any ship willing to take you to Krakatoa.  With the travel warning and the worsening weather, you have difficulty finding any ships ready to leave port, much less travel to the Sunda Strait.  After several increasingly desperate hours, you finally meet a weathered fisherman named Sukiman who agrees to hear you out.  The old Indonesian man pays close attention as you speak, but seems to study you more than the words you say.  You offer Sukiman as much as you can, but he simply holds his hand up.  \"You must be truly desperate, or perhaps a fool,\" he muses, eyes still locked on you, \"but I trust that almighty God has sent you to me.  I will help you.\"\n"
"You waste no time in casting off from Singapore, setting immediate course for the Sunda Strait.  The days in transit give you time to prepare yourself and Sukiman for the ordeals ahead.  It's difficult to summarize your goal without sounding like a crackpot theorist, but the fisherman responds with a troubled look on his face.  \"There are a great many things in this world that I do not understand, but I understand the sea above all else.  It has been a companion to me through many long voyages, and I know its rhythm and swell like I know my own heartbeat.  Its rhythm has faltered.\"  Sukiman pauses, brow furled in concentration.  \"Only once before have I seen it falter, years ago when madness struck the artists of Singapore.  One drowned himself in the harbor beside my boat.  I can still remember his expression.  It was the same as yours when you first approached me, only filled with despair.  The madness stopped at the same time that the sea regained its rhythm, but I never forgot.  That is why I agreed to help you.  You know what has affected the sea, and you mean to stop it.  Again, I trust that God has brought you to me for this task, to return the seas to normal -- and perhaps much more.\"\n"
"You stand beside him in silence, contemplating his words and the burden that lies on your shoulders.  Preventing the rise of Cthulhu was not what you signed up for when you accepted Wycliffe's offer nearly two months ago, but the stakes are clear.  Stop the architects or the world will be embroiled in madness.  A sudden gasp from Sukiman rouses your attention, and he points ahead to the sea before the ship.  Unmistakably, the horizon is bending."

msgid "Sukiman brings his ship alongside the rocky shore of the island, close enough for you to jump over and wade in.  You tell Sukiman to get well clear of the island, unsure of what will happen whether you succeed or fail in stopping the architects.  The old fisherman grabs your hands with both of his and nods.  \"I pray for your success.  Find your way to the sea when your work is done, and the sea shall lead me to you.\"  You leap into the water -- already warm from the nearby volcanic activity -- and Sukiman's ship pulls away, quickly vanishing in the fractured space around the island.  The volcano towers above you, though now at this distance you can see that its slopes don't meet naturally.  The peak seems to be cobbled together from who knows how many segments of other volcanoes.  You hope that the mountain holds together as you attempt to scale it."

msgid "You collapse to the deck of Sukiman's ship, battered and straining to keep your wits about you under the maddening assault.  The shifting dimensions, constant attacks, and the unrelenting elements all have proved too much to overcome.  You hear a dull shout from Sukiman to see that space has shifted once more, placing you in the path of an enormous fiery boulder.  The projectile blasts through the ship, shattering the front half of the ship and igniting what little remains.  The force of the impact hurls you deep into the water, but as you try to swim for the surface, you find yourself only sinking further.  The bisecting dimensions keep shunting you deeper underwater.  Deeper and darker, until your last bit of stamina fails.  The sea claims you, and soon thereafter, dread Cthulhu claims the sea."

msgid "The overwhelming sensation finally climaxes with a fantastic rush of air.  You are blown backward at high speed, just ahead of a tremendous explosion -- but not a volcanic one.  A wall water shifts in suddenly before you, rushing toward you at nearly the same speed, mere inches from your face.  The torrent falls before you do, softening the impact but threatening to drown you as the water flows its disjointed course.  You struggle in the unnatural current for minutes on end before your hands finally grip onto -- or perhaps around -- a rocky formation.  You maintain your grip until the deluge recedes, and the cacophony fades until you can only hear the familiar ambiance of the sea.  Carefully, you relax your grip and open your eyes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your vandalism of the carefully-designed monolith triggers a collapse and reordering of the world around the pillar.  You are thrown to the ground from the force of the event, as a tremendous explosion sounds from all around you -- though not a volcanic one.  Water rockets upward, funneling completely around the narrow patch of rock you lie on.  Chunks of loose stone flow toward you, only to suddenly disappear and continue away on a different trajectory.  Even in its ruined state, the unnatural stone bends space around itself, keeping you in a pocket untouched by the torrential water.  Gradually, the current slows and suspends for a tense moment before falling away.  Shapes begin to clarify through the draining water -- shapes that should be impossible, but you know can only exist in one place on Earth."
msgstr ""

msgid "Before you lies an unsettling vista, jagged and alien, but perhaps most unsettling because it is familiar.  You have seen this unnatural landscape many times in the visions and dreams that have haunted you since the very beginning.  R'lyeh, the sunken island tomb of Cthulhu, has risen to the surface.  Water drains down the impossible angles of its rock formations while deep sea flora and fauna lie scattered and dying around its landscape.  The architects have succeeded."
