msgid "Scenario V: Across Dreadful Waters"
msgstr ""

msgid "Singapore, halfway around the world from Arkham.  Whether the city itself is the focus of the cultists' plot or some other place nearby, your course is clear.  You return to Arkham immediately and prepare everything you'll need for the long journey before telephoning the harbor in nearby Kingsport.  There are three ships slated to depart tonight: a light steamer headed for the Canary Islands, a passenger ship en route to Europe, and a cargo ship bound for Panama.  You'll be able to change ships at each port to gradually make your way to Singapore, but which route will improve your odds the most?"

It's only a slight relief that the cultists haven't caught up with you yet, as you recall Ernie Vickers from the O'Bannions' auction house.  The loan shark takes a step forward and adjusts his glasses, eyes dead set on you.  \"Skip town once, shame on you.  Skip town twice, shame on me.  It would be damaging to my reputation if I let you wander with my money, so why don't we settle your account before you go on your merry way?\"  Ernie gives a small, cruel smile, and his cronies step up alongside him.  They squeeze their fists idly, clearly hoping that you can't or won't pay up."
