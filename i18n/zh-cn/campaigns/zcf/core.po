"Some resolutions and interludes in the <i>Cyclopean Foundations</i> campaign will instruct players to add or remove <b>Notice</b> to or from the Campaign Log.  This is done by marking on the meter on the second page of the Campaign Log.\n"
"Later in the campaign, some scenarios may be changed or altered depending on how much <b>Notice</b> the investigators have.  <b>Notice</b> is shared among all of the investigators, and it is not tied to any specific investigator.  <b>Notice</b> has no game effect except when explicitly referenced by the Campaign Guide or by a card effect."
