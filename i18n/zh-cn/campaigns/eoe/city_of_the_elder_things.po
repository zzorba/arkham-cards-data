msgid "Scenario III: City of the Elder Things"
msgstr "冒险III：古老者之城"

msgid "As you read the scenario introduction, check the Campaign Log and read any passage that corresponds to your situation."
msgstr "在阅读冒险引言时，检查剧本日志，阅读每一段与你处境对应的段落。"

msgid "Even with the knowledge afforded to you by Dyer's report, you find yourself wholly unprepared for the terrible vastness of the blasphemous city at the heart of Antarctica, and its alien inscrutability. Massive towers, temples, bridges, and pyramids dot the broad landscape. In the ineluctable light of dawn, the nameless maze of cyclopean structures and angular blocks extends for miles in every direction, unmistakably real and yet impossible to believe. It is truly a wonder of the world."
msgstr "即使你从戴尔的报告中已经得知，你还是发现自己完全没有准备好面对南极中心的这座可怕而巨大的亵渎之城，以及它那属于异星的种种不可思议。巨大的塔楼、庙宇、桥梁和金字塔点缀著广阔的风景。在遍及四处的晨光中，这座由巨大结构和棱角分明的石块组成的无名迷宫向每个方向延伸数英里，无疑是真实的，但却让人难以置信。这毫无疑问是世间奇观。"

msgid "If Dr. Mala Sinha is alive:"
msgstr "如果玛拉·辛哈医生活著："

msgid "\"Remember, stay covered at all times. Where we are headed, the wind can flash freeze your skin almost instantly. And stay hydrated,\" Dr. Sinha reminds you. \"The air here is dryer than you think.\" The remainder of the party nods in understanding. None of you have come this far just to catch hypothermia… but it's almost as likely as death by anything else in this damnable place."
msgstr "“记住，要始终保持隐蔽。在我们要去的地方，风几乎能在瞬间冻结你的皮肤。还有保持水分。”辛哈医生提醒你，“这里的空气比你想像的要干燥。”团队中的其余人都点头表示理解。你们都不想走了这么远却死于体温过低……但在这该死的地方，这和死于其他方式几乎没有分别。"

msgid "The investigators suffer no ill effects."
msgstr "调查员没有承受任何不良效果。"

msgid "You were briefed many times on the dangers of the Antarctic environment, but without Dr. Sinha, you're at a disadvantage braving the harsh weather. What she lacked in bedside manner, she made up in expertise. Wishing you could have saved her, you grit your teeth and trudge on, watching your companions for any sign of hypothermia."
msgstr "你听过很多次南极环境的危险，但没有辛哈医生，你在恶劣的天气中非常不利。她用专业知识弥补了对病人态度的不足。你真希望自己当时能救下她，但现在只能咬紧牙关，继续艰难前行，观察著同伴是否有体温过低的迹象。"

msgid "Each investigator adds a Frostbitten weakness to their deck. It does not count toward that investigator's deck size."
msgstr "每位调查员将一张冻伤弱点加入自己牌组。这张卡牌不计入该调查员的牌组卡牌张数。"

msgid "As you descend the peaks surrounding the city, trespassing furtively over its walls, the slopes give way to gradual, shallower foothills peppered with structures of black, primordial stone. Towers or outposts, perhaps, linking the natural outer walls of the city to its outskirts. \"We should search one of those watchtowers,\" one of the team members suggests, pointing to the closest structure. You nod in agreement. Dyer's report had observed a wealth of information carved into the walls of several structures within the city, after all—perhaps you'll stumble upon a map or diagram of the city to aid in your exploration."
msgstr "当你沿著环绕城市的山峰往下走，偷偷地越过城墙，斜坡被平缓的、较浅的山麓所取代，山麓上点缀著黑色原始的石制建筑。这些也许是塔楼或前哨，将城市的自然外墙与市郊连接起来。“我们应该搜查其中一个瞭望塔。”一名队员指著最近的建筑建议道。你点头赞同。戴尔的报告中提到，他观察到在这座城市一些建筑的墙壁上雕刻了大量的资讯，毕竟——也许你会在探索中偶然发现一幅地图或城市的示意图。"

msgid "<i>If the investigators scouted the city outskirts:</i>"
msgstr "<i>如果调查员对城市市郊进行了侦查：</i>"

msgid "Instead of heading to the watchtower, you call out to the others to follow you. Recalling the route you and Ellsworth had scouted out the night before, you lead the group toward the half-buried structure you spotted. It takes a bit longer to get there than the watchtower, but provides an easy shortcut into the city proper."
msgstr "你叫其他人跟著你，而不是前往瞭望塔。回想起你和埃尔斯沃思前一天晚上侦查的路线，你带著队伍走向你们发现的半埋的建筑。到那儿去比瞭望塔花了更多时间，但是它提供了一条进入城市的捷径。"

msgid "During setup, after you reveal the starting location, the lead investigator discovers clues from that location equal to half its clue value (rounded up)."
msgstr "冒险设置期间，你揭示起始地点后，调查员队长发现该地点的线索，数量等于其线索值的一半(向上取整)。"

msgid "If Professor William Dyer is alive:"
msgstr "如果威廉·戴尔教授活著："

"\"Be careful,\" the professor warns. You are keen to heed his wisdom, earned as it is through hard experience. \"The glyphs inscribed here depict much about the history of this place. It is ancient. Far more ancient than anything our species has built.\"\n"
"\"What is your point?\" someone chimes in.\n"
"\"Do you know the old phrase, 'the walls have ears and the doors have eyes?'\" Dyer replies. \"We have no idea what could be hiding within these walls. What dwells under the ice and stone. Be on alert… and do not let any voices but our own rattle in your skull. Do you understand?\"\n"
"You nod in agreement, gulping down a wave of nausea. You cannot help but take the meaning of Dyer's idiom literally."
msgstr ""
"“小心。”教授警告说。你渴望听从他的智慧，因为这是通过艰苦的经历得来的。“刻在这里的象形文字描述了许多这个地方的历史。它很古老。比我们人类建造的任何东西都要古老得多。”\n"
"“你的意思是？”有人插话。\n"
"“你知道那句老话吗，‘墙有耳，门有眼’？”戴尔回答，“我们不知道墙后藏著什么。冰雪和石头下住著什么。保持警惕……除了我们的声音，别让其他声音在你的脑袋里嗡嗡作响。明白了吗？”\n"
"你点头赞同，强压住一阵恶心。你不禁从字面上理解戴尔的习语。"

msgid "As you enter the tower, the cold dwindles, but the sense of unease you felt observing the city from a distance only grows. Without Dyer's wisdom to guide you through this place, you feel completely unprepared. Every drop of water, every shifting pebble, every hushed breath causes your throat to clench and your heart to race. It's not long before you hear whispering in the walls—voices that don't belong to you, or anyone in your party. The more you try to deny it, the stronger the voices become. A choir in your mind. A warning?"
msgstr "当你进入塔内，寒冷逐渐消失，但从远处观察这座城市时感受到的不安却更为强烈。没有戴尔的智慧引导，你觉得自己毫无准备。每一滴水、每一颗跳动的卵石、每一次屏住的呼吸，都让你的喉咙紧绷、心跳加速。过了不久你就听到墙里的窃窃私语——这声音不属于你，也不属于你的同伴。你越不想听，那些声音就越强烈。在你思想中响起的合唱。是警告吗？"

msgid "Each investigator adds a Possessed weakness to their deck. It does not count toward that investigator's deck size."
msgstr "每位调查员将一张附身弱点加入自己牌组。这张卡牌不计入该调查员牌组的卡牌张数。"

"The open entrance to the obsidian structure greets you like the maw of a ferocious predator. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, your curiosity gives way to deep, profound dread. The structure's sharp, angular main hall is the site of an absolute massacre. Mangled Elder Thing corpses litter the floor—piles of leathery gray flesh and sticky, misshapen organs, coated in thick, dark-green fluid. You reel at the awful stench of death. These dead are not ancient. This slaughter must have been recent.\n"
"\"What could have done this?\" One of your party breaks the immense silence. Murals on the walls draw your attention, depicting what you have come to know as the race of Elder Things embroiled in battle with some ancient, terrifying foe—no, not one. Many. Your party dares not dwell in this slaughterhouse long. Covering your noses to block the awful stench, you take your leave."
msgstr ""
"这座黑曜石建筑那敞开的入口，就像凶猛的食肉动物对你张开了血盆大口。当你的眼睛适应了黑暗时，你的好奇心被深深的恐惧所取代。这座建筑那棱角分明的主厅就是个屠杀现场。血肉模糊的古老者尸体散落一地——成堆的灰色皮肉和黏糊糊的畸形器官，上面涂著厚厚的墨绿色液体。尸臭让你感到无比恶心。这些遗体并不久远。这次屠杀一定是最近发生的。\n"
"“究竟是什么东西做了这样的事？”一名队员打破了寂静。墙上的壁画吸引了你的注意，上面描绘的是你所知道的古老者种族卷入战争，对方是某个古老而可怕的敌人——不，不止一种。是许多种。你们不敢在这个屠杀现场待太久。捂住鼻子挡住恶臭，你们赶紧离开。"

Just as you are considering how to dig your way through, Cookie approaches with a few sticks of dynamite bundled together. \"Oh, fer Chrissake. Move out of the way,\" he grumbles, setting the sticks up and lighting the fuse without another warning.You and the others run around the corner, covering your ears and cursing under your breath. Seconds later, a tremendous explosion shakes the building to its foundations. When the dust settles, Cookie has made an easy exit for the party. \"Sometimes, Cookie, I swear…\" someone remarks."
msgstr "不幸的是，当你试图离开建筑时，你发现通道被冰雪和碎石堵塞了。就在你正在考虑如何挖出一条路的时候，曲奇拿了几根捆在一起的炸药走过来。“噢，看在老天份上。闪开。”他一边抱怨，一边把炸药设置好，毫无征兆地就点燃了导火索。你和其他人连忙跑到拐角处，捂著耳朵低声咒骂。几秒钟后，一场巨大的爆炸震动了整个建筑。当一切尘埃落定，曲奇为团队开了一条捷径。“有时候，曲奇，我发誓……”有人说。"

msgstr "在混乱袋里加入1个[frost]标记。"

msgid "The trail of sickly green blood leads out and dribbles down a smooth path sculpted, as if by an acidic substance, out of the mountainside. In the opposite direction, the mountain ridge continues along the perimeter of the city. In the distance, you can just make out a darkened, half-buried section of the city, the layout of its structures completely unfamiliar to you, even after going through Dyer's notes extensively. Finally, in the heart of the city, a great pyramid and many prominent temples lie scattered, rising to amazing heights despite the weathering of many eons."
msgstr "一条恶心的绿色血迹从山腰延伸出来，沿著一条平滑的小路滴落下来，这条小路仿佛是被一种酸性物质雕刻出来的。在相反的方向，山脊继续沿著城市的周边延续。在远处，你只能辨认出城市黑暗的、半被掩埋的部分，即使在仔细阅读了戴尔的笔记之后，它的结构布局对你来说还是完全陌生。最终，在城市的中心，一座巨大的金字塔和许多显眼的寺庙散布在各处，尽管历经千万年的风化，仍高耸入云。"

msgid "Injured and weary, you hole up in the relative safety of one of the city's towering structures. Your only hope is to take shelter within the alien city and hope your presence goes unnoticed by the denizens that still prowl its streets and ancient halls."
msgstr "你受伤且疲惫不堪，躲在这座城市高耸的建筑中一个相对安全的地方。你唯一的希望是在这个异星生物的城市中避难，祈祷你的存在不会被仍然徘徊在它的街道和古老大厅里的居民注意到。"

"A quiet, unearthly stillness welcomes you as your party delves into the secret passageway. You expected to be greeted by sound and fury, but this eerie silence is almost worse. Not a word is spoken as you slink deeper and deeper into the secret shaft, making note of the peculiar smoothness of the walls, the bizarre markings along the floor, the muted drip, drip, drip of water in the distance.\n"
"For hours you continue into the deep dark, questioning your judgment with each step. What kind of people walk willingly into the jaws of such horror? You risked your reputation going on this expedition to begin with. Then you risked your life not turning back the moment things turned dire. Now you risk your very sanity unearthing secrets no human was ever meant to find.\n"
"Is this bravery? Or the final mistake of a herd of fools, too stubborn to see that their own deaths lie at the end of this road? It matters not. You've come too far to turn back now. One way or another, you will get the answers you seek. The only question is whether you'll live to tell the world what you found."

"当你的团队潜入秘密通道时，怪异的寂静迎接著你。你以为迎接你的是喧嚣和愤怒，但这种诡异的寂静几乎更糟糕。当你越来越深入这个秘密竖井时，你们全都沉默不语。你注意著光滑的墙壁、地板上奇异的标记，以及远处柔和的<b>滴答、滴答、滴答</b>的滴水声。\n"
"你在一片漆黑中持续走了几个小时，每一步都在质疑自己的判断。什么样的人才会心甘情愿地进入这样恐怖的鬼地方啊？你赌上名誉参加这次探险。然后你赌上性命在情况变糟的时候也不肯回头。现在你要赌上你全部的理智发现人类不该发现的秘密。\n"
"这是勇敢吗？还是一群傻子犯下的致命错误，太固执以至于看不清这条路的尽头就是自己的死亡？但这些都不重要了。你已经走了太远，现在无法回头了。无论如何，你都会得到你想要的答案。唯一的问题是你能否活下去，来告诉全世界你的发现。"

"Hours pass. You dare not venture outside, but you explore every crevice of your sanctuary, hoping to find something to make this endeavor worthwhile. What you find instead is even harder to believe. In the icy sub-level of the structure, a sacred chamber houses a churning pool of kaleidoscopic miasma. Gray, swirling mist evaporates from its surface Familiar shapes and strange hallucinations materializing and vanishing within.\n"
"As if sensing your approach, the pool stops whirling and rises on its own, almost as if in greeting. Then, it coalesces into a shimmering glob of prismatic color and crawls along the floor, stopping when you stop, continuing along as you follow. It beckons you closer, guiding you. You glance at one another with trepidation. Is it trying to show you something? To take you somewhere? And if so… is it truly wise to follow?\n"
"Eventually, you come to an agreement. There is no use dawdling here, and the weather grows fouler with each passing minute. You decide to follow with caution, hoping perhaps it will lead you to answers. For hours you continue into the deep dark, questioning your judgment with each step. The ancient structure gives way to icy tunnels, walls smooth and slick with dark ichor, floor covered in bizarre markings of unknowable origin. Finally, the glob of miasma seeps back into the walls and disappears, leaving you alone with your doubts, your fears, and the impossibly long shaft breaching through the icy heart of Antarctica and into the depths beyond…"

"进入幕间故事III：最后一夜。\n"
"几个小时过去了。你不敢到外面去冒险，但你探索了避难所的每一个缝隙，希望能找到一些值得的东西。然而你的发现反而更让人难以置信。在这座建筑冰冷的底层，有一个神圣的房间，里面充满了千变万化的瘴气。旋转的灰雾从表面蒸发，熟悉的形状和奇怪的幻觉在里面出现和消失。\n"
"仿佛感觉到了你的到来，那团瘴气停止了旋转，自己升了起来，仿佛是在打招呼。然后，它凝聚成闪烁的、五光十色的一团，沿著地板向前爬行，当你停止时它也停止，当你跟随时它又继续前进。它招呼你靠近，引导著你。你们惊恐地面面相觑。它是不是想告诉你什么？想带你去什么地方？如果是这样的话……跟著它真的明智吗？\n"
"最终，你们达成了统一。在这儿磨蹭是没有用的，天气每分钟都在变得更坏。你决定谨慎地跟随，希望它能给你带来答案。你在一片漆黑中持续走了几个小时，每一步都在质疑自己的判断。这座古代建筑连通著冰冷隧道，墙壁被黑色脓水涂抹得平稳光滑，地板上覆盖著来历不明的奇异标记。最后，那一团瘴气又渗进了墙壁，消失了，只留下你一个人，带著你的疑惑，带著你的恐惧，向著那不可思议的长长的竖井走去，穿过南极的冰雪中心，进入深渊彼端……"
