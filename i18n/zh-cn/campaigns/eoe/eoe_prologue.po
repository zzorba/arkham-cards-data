"\"I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarctic—with its vast fossil-hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice-cap—and I am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain. Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet if I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left.\"\n"

"\"You understand now, yes? Why this expedition must be stopped?\" Professor William Dyer sits across from you at his office desk. A wealth of academic papers and scientific journals lies sprawled between you, including Dyer’s own lengthy account of his journey to the Antarctic. Up until the publication of this revised report—the alleged \"truth\"—the university’s last expedition to Antarctica yielded very little in the way of scientific discoveries.\n"
"At Dyer’s request, you’d read through this new report of what really happened beyond those \"Mountains of Madness,\" as he had dubbed them. You scarcely would have believed any of it were it not for the bevy of photographs and drawings that came along with it: evidence of mangled, dissected bodies; of perplexing five-pointed snow graves; of strange specimens found half-buried in the ice; and, finally, aerial shots of the jagged black peaks described in Dyer’s tale.\n"
"Dyer has called on you to help convince his colleagues to abandon their planned follow-up expedition. His student, Danforth—the only other member of the expedition to reach the alien stone-city described in Dyer’s report—paces back and forth by the entrance to Dyer’s office, muttering nonsensically to himself while you consider their strange tale.\n"
"You’re still unsure what to make of all this. On the one hand, Dyer’s concern seems genuine, and his account is filled with such detail and specificity that you find it difficult to doubt its authenticity. And yet, there’s no way it could all be true. An ancient city in the ice, built by primordial beings? So-called \"Elder Things\"? How could such things be real? Danforth mumbles something about a nameless black pit as you place Dyer’s report back on his desk. The professor gazes at you with sleepless, bloodshot eyes. \"Well?\" Dyer asks. \"Will you help us stop this madness? Will you make them see reason?\""

"“现在你明白了吧？为什么必须中止这次探险？”威廉·戴尔教授和你面对面坐在他的办公桌前。你们中间散落著大量学术论文和科学期刊，包括戴尔自己对南极之旅的长篇叙述。在这份修订后的报告——所谓的“真相”——发表之前，大学对南极洲的最近一次考察在科学发现方面都收效甚微。\n"
"在戴尔的要求下，你阅读了这些新的报告，关于那些他称之为“疯狂山脉”另一边的真实情况。如果没有报告附带的那些照片和图画，你几乎不会相信这一切。这些证据包括：被肢解的残破尸体；令人费解的五角形雪冢；半埋在雪里的奇怪标本；以及最后，从空中拍摄的、在戴尔的故事中所描述的那锯齿状的黑色山峰。\n"
"戴尔请你帮助他说服他的同事，放弃他们计划中的后续探险。在你思考著他们离奇的故事时，他的学生丹佛斯——在戴尔的报告中，是上次探险中唯一一个和他到达了异形石城的其他成员——正在办公室门口来回踱步，嘴里自言自语的讲一些胡话。\n"
"你仍然不确定这一切是怎么回事。一方面，戴尔似乎是真的很担心，他的叙述充斥著如此详尽的细节和特征，你很难怀疑它的真实性。然而，这也不可能都是真的。一座由原始生物建造的冰雪中的古老城市？所谓的“古老者”？这种事情怎么可能是真的呢？在你将戴尔的报告放回他桌上时，丹佛斯咕哝著什么无名黑坑。教授用失眠充血的眼睛盯著你。“怎么样？”戴尔问道，“你能帮我们阻止这疯狂吗？你能让他们明白吗？”"

"Dyer lets out an anxious breath and relents. \"I suppose I might have said the same thing, once. But now, after what I’ve seen…\" A shudder courses through the man’s aging body. \"You are venturing somewhere humanity does not belong. I am starting to believe that scholars such as ourselves can only continue to probe the depths of science for so long before we are laid low by what we find.\"\n"
"\"Or by what finds us,\" Danforth chimes from behind.\n"
"Dyer glances at his student, studying his expression, then turns his attention back to you. \"If you go on this journey with Dr. Kensler, the lot of you may not ever return. Will you not reconsider?\"\n"
"You explain that while there is surely significant danger in your expedition, Dr. Amy Kensler—the scientist leading this new trek to Antarctica—has taken precautions to ensure it does not meet the same end as Dyer’s. More importantly, it is the only way to understand the threats they encountered, and the only way to prepare if such threats are unearthed by other, less cautious scientists.\n"
"\"Yes, I… I confess I had that same worry,\" he replies. \"We are unlikely to convince the greater scientific community, I’m afraid. Perhaps it would be better to… to return, and learn more about what we saw…\"\n"
"Danforth nods. \"I agree. How do we know what we saw is anything more than the overactive imaginings of two explorers with a queer fascination for the bizarre and macabre? Of Arthur Gordon Pym’s ill-fated journeys?\"\n"
"Dyer’s eyes narrow at his student. The knowledge reflected in his dark eyes chills you to your core. \"You say such things, and yet, I daresay you did not see what I saw.\"\n"
"The student scoffs. \"You are not the one who glimpsed that mirage at the edge of the mountainside—\"\n"
"\"I am not referring to the ‘mirage,’ Danforth; I am referring to what I saw in you,\" Dyer retorts. \"The things you said on that aeroplane, the look on your face… I’ll never forget.\" Silence pervades the room as Danforth returns to his corner to languish in his own doubt.\n"
"Dyer pleads with you. \"Whatever the case may be, is there nothing I can say to deter you?\" You ponder for a brief moment, then shake your head. There is too much at stake—especially if Dyer’s account turns out to be the truth.\n"
"\"All right, then,\" Dyer concludes with a sigh. \"Since you lot have no clue what you are getting into, I suppose we have no choice but to come, too. You can tell Dr. Kensler that she wins. We will be ready to leave within the week.\"\n"
"You shake his hand and make for the door. \"I hope, for all our sakes, that Danforth is right,\" he adds before you are out of earshot."

"戴尔长舒一口气，平静了下来。“以前的我可能也会这么说。但是现在，在我看到过……”他衰老的身体一阵颤栗。“你在不属于人类的地方冒险。我开始相信，像我们这样的学者，只能在科学的深渊探索一阵，然后就会被我们发现的东西压垮。\n"
"“或者被发现我们的东西压垮。”丹佛斯在后面插话道。\n"
"戴尔瞥了他的学生一眼，琢磨了一下他的表情，然后把注意力转回你身上。“如果你随同肯斯勒博士一同踏上这次旅途，很可能全员有去无回。你不再考虑一下吗？”\n"
"你解释说，虽然你们的探险肯定会有重大的危险，但艾米·肯斯勒博士——带领这次新的南极之旅的科学家——已经采取了预防措施，确保不会出现像戴尔那次一样的结局。更重要的是，这是了解他们遭遇到的威胁的唯一方式，也是在这些威胁被其他缺乏谨慎的科学家发现前作好准备的唯一方式。\n"
"“是的，我……我承认我也有同样的顾虑。”他回答道，“恐怕我们无法说服整个科学界。也许回去更多了解那些我们所看到的……会更好……”\n"
"丹佛斯点头。“我同意。我们怎么知道我们看到的也许只是两个对怪诞和恐怖过于著迷的探险家的异想天开呢？就像亚瑟·戈登·皮姆的不幸之旅？”\n"
"戴尔眯著眼睛看向他的学生。他黑暗的眼睛中所蕴藏的知识使你毛骨悚然。“就算你这么觉得，但我敢说你并不理解我所看到的东西。 ”\n"

"“我指的不是‘幻景’，丹佛斯；我指的是我在你身上看到的东西。”戴尔反驳，“你在飞机上说的那些话，你当时的表情……我永远不会忘记。”丹佛斯回到他的角落苦思他自己的疑问，房内一片寂静。\n"
"戴尔恳求你。“无论事态会如何发展，无论我说什么都无法阻止你了吗？”你想了一会儿，然后摇摇头。有太多的利害关系——特别是如果戴尔的叙述被证明是真实的话。\n"
"“那好吧。”戴尔叹了口气，下了决定。“既然你们不知道将要面对的是什么，我想我们除了一起去，也别无选择。你可以告诉肯斯勒博士，她赢了。我们会在这周内作好出发准备。”你握了握他的手，向门口走去。\n"

"Dyer’s jaw clenches and his cheeks redden. For a moment he looks as though he is about to slam his fist on the desk between the two of you, but after a moment of consideration, he takes a deep breath and shakes his head. \"I suppose to any reasonable person it should seem that way. Perhaps my faith in the scientific community was misplaced. Of course Dr. Kensler would not believe me, not even with all this evidence.\" He shoves several of the photographs on his desk aside in frustration.\n"
"You explain that Dr. Amy Kensler—the scientist leading this new trek to Antarctica—is motivated by genuine academic curiosity, rather than greed or glory.\n"
"\"It matters not,\" Dyer remarks bitterly. \"Even so, she seeks more evidence of my findings, despite my warnings. And so the cycle continues. Perhaps science itself is naught but folly. We are but silly little mice under glass, seeking escape for our own sake, with little understanding of what lies beyond our cage.\"\n"

"戴尔咬紧牙关，两颊发红。有那么一会儿，他看上去好像要用拳头猛锤你们之间的桌子，但经过片刻的考虑，他深吸一口气，摇了摇头。“看来在任何有理智的人眼中，都应该是这样。也许我不该将信仰寄托在科学界吧。当然，即使有这么多的证据，肯斯勒博士还是不会相信我的。”他沮丧地把桌上的几张照片推到一边。\n"
"你解释说，艾米·肯斯勒博士——带领这次新的南极之旅的科学家——的动机是纯粹的学术好奇心，而不是贪婪或荣誉。\n"

"Standing in front of the plankway leading up to the deck of the Theodosia is <minicaps>Dr. Amy Kensler</minicaps>. A professor of Biology at Miskatonic University, the no-nonsense scientist has been a fixture of the university’s Sciences department for over a decade. Without so much as peering up from her clipboard, she crosses off your name as you approach. \"Good of you to make it on time. Mr. Ellsworth here will take your luggage aboard.\"\n"
"\"Oh, I will, will I?\" the man standing next to her replies with a chuckle. He offers you his hand in introduction, and you shake it. \"<minicaps>Roald Ellsworth</minicaps>, at your service.\"\n"
"By way of introduction, Dr. Kensler explains, \"Mr Ellsworth has been on over a dozen expeditions and comes highly recommended. I’m sure his expertise will be invaluable in the weeks to come.\"\n"
"Ellsworth rolls his eyes. \"His expertise, yes… and his willingness to be used as manual labor!\" he adds with a chuckle as he hefts your luggage and takes it up the plankway.\n"
"\"Come on, Ellsworth!\" shouts another voice from inside the ship. A gruff-looking man with a thick brown beard emerges, motioning for Ellsworth to hurry. \"We got a ton ‘o work to get done before we embark!\"\n"
"\"A little busy, Cookie,\" Ellsworth shouts back in reply. Then he turns back to you and remarks over his shoulder: \"Do not mind him. Cookie is a bit of an intense fellow, but he is all right.\"\n"
"\"The name’s Fredericks,\" the gruff man barks back. \"<minicaps>James Fredericks</minicaps>. I swear, sometimes I think I’m the only one here who’s ready for this damned trip,\" he mutters angrily. \"An’ didn’t anyone ever tell yeh it’s bad luck to name a ship after someone who died at sea?\"\n"
"Another voice calls down from the deck of the ship: \"Cookie, if you could be so kind as to lower your voice, some of us are trying to work up here.\" The man responds with a grunt and ducks back inside the ship, rolling his eyes. You crane your head upwards and see a young woman leaning over the railing of the ship’s deck, her long brown hair tied in a thick ponytail that dangles around her neck. \"Hey! You made it,\" she calls out to you. \"Dr. Kensler was pretty excited that you’re coming along. Looking forward to working with you.\"\n"
"Without looking up from her clipboard, Dr. Kensler mumbles. \"Ms. <minicaps>Takada Hiroko</minicaps> is our aeroplane mechanic. As with the previous expedition, we will be constructing our planes onsite. No need to worry—she may be one of the youngest in her field, but she knows what she is doing.\"\n"
"More of the crew begin to arrive, one by one. The first is a man in his 30s with a wispy blonde beard and bright green eyes. \"Mr. <minicaps>Avery Claypool</minicaps>,\" Dr. Kensler introduces you to the man, and the two of you shake hands. \"Mr. Claypool is an…associate…of Mr. Ellsworth’s. He will be serving as our guide in the Antarctic.\"\n"
"\"Weather permitting,\" Claypool jokes. \"Honestly, we will be lucky if we can even get off the ice shelf.\"\n"
"\"I am confident with your skills we will make it as far as Dyer and Lake did.\"\n"
"\"That is what I am afraid of,\" Claypool mutters, walking briskly past Kensler and up the plankway. On his way up, he passes Ellsworth, and the two freeze, locking eyes. You could swear that the temperature lowers several degrees as the two brush by one another without a single word.\n"
"\"They are usually on…better terms,\" Dr. Kensler says under her breath, \"but recently fell into some issue or another. They had better learn to live with their differences. They will be unable to avoid one another for quite some time, after all.\" You watch as Claypool’s gaze wanders back to Ellsworth for just a fraction of a second before he turns away angrily and enters the ship.\n"
"The next to arrive is a woman with warm brown skin and weary eyes. Along with her luggage, she carries a rather large, bright-red medical kit emblazoned with a white cross. She extends her hand, and you cannot help but notice the nervous tremble in Dr. Kensler's hand as she shakes it. \"Thank you for joining us on this voyage, Mala.\"\n"
"\"Oh, Amy. Somebody has to keep you alive,\" she replies. There is a moment of awkward silence as Dr. Kensler glances up at the woman, then down at her feet, her cheeks tinged red. \"Right. Well, then,\" she remarks, and continues up the walkway.\n"
"Dr.Kensler clears her throat once she is out of earshot. \"<minicaps>Dr. Mala Sinha</minicaps> is our physician,\" she explains. \"It took some convincing to get her to join us, so try not to abuse her expertise with inconsequential problems. Frostbite will be a very real concern, as will gangrene and hypothermia. Try to stay on her good side.\" You're unsure if Dr. Kensler is joking.\n"
"A man's voice pierces the sudden silence, along with the clamor of a dog barking. \"Anyu! Dammit, Anyu, don't run off like that!\" he shouts.\n"
"\"That will be Mr. Ashevak,\" Dr. Kensler says, scratching off another name from her list. Moments later, you watch as a large gray-furred dog bounds toward you, its tongue hanging out of its mouth in excitement. You lean over and pet the dog, running your hand along her thick, long fur. The man finally catches up to the dog, huffing with effort. 'Anyu… Come on, I thought I… trained you better than this,\" he says, catching his breath.\n"
"\"<minicaps>Eliyah Ashevak</minicaps> is our dog handler,\" Dr. Kensler interjects, \"He is in charge of taking care of the 44 sledge dogs we are bringing along with us, not to mention their feeding and training.\"\n"
"\"Anyu here makes 45,\" he corrects her before turning to shake your hand. \"Also, we'll be holed up in this ship for a while, so let's drop the formalities. Just 'Eliyah' is fine.\"\n"
"As the man and his enormous dog board the ship, you ask Dr. Kensler if she received the letter you sent regarding Professor Dyer's concerns. \"I am well aware of his report,' Dr. Kensler replies, \"but as I have told him time and time again, I have no intention of ceasing or postponing this expedition—\" Just then, footsteps approach behind you, interrupting your conversation. \"—speak of the devil,\" Dr. Kensler mutters, looking up from her clipboard. You turn to find none other than <minicaps>Professor William Dyer</minicaps> and his student <minicaps>Danforth</minicaps>, each toting several bags of luggage. \"I'm glad you finally decided to join us, William.\"\n"
"\"Amy,\" he acknowledges. \"I am not here because I believe in your mission statement. I am here to make sure you and your companions do not get themselves killed. You have no idea what you are walking into.\"\n"
"\"Then you will have ample enough opportunity to educate us along the way.\" She turns to address young Danforth, who is staring up at the tanker ship with a pained expression. \"Danforth, I hope you understand that you are under no obligation to come along on this expedition. After everything you went through…\" she trails off, her eyebrows raised in worry atypical of her usual cold demeanor.\n"
"\"I appreciate your concern, Dr. Kensler, but I am looking forward to the opportunity to return to Antarctica. I want… need… to be there again.\"\n"
"She follows his gaze to the Theodosia, which bobs steadily up and down on the choppy Atlantic waters. \"Very well. We are still working to get all of our equipment aboard. Mr. Ellsworth can help you find your rooms.\" You nod and begin boarding, along with the remaining crew and the rest of the expedition team—mostly students of the university, along with several unaffiliated explorers and several researchers in a variety of fields. Once more you spy the scant sliver of sunlight above before it is smothered by gray clouds."

"站在通往<b>菲奥多西亚号</b>甲板的跳板前的，就是<minicaps>艾米·肯斯勒博士</minicaps>。作为米斯卡塔尼克大学的生物学教授，这位严肃的科学家十多年来一直是大学科学系的常驻成员。在你走近时，她甚至都没有抬头看你一眼，就在写字板上划掉了你的名字。“你能准时赶到，很好。这位埃尔斯沃思先生会把你的行李搬上去的。”\n"
"“噢，那不是当然的吗？”站在她身边的男子轻笑著回答。他伸出手与你握了一下，自我介绍道：“<minicaps>罗尔德·埃尔斯沃思</minicaps>为您效劳。”\n"
"肯斯勒博士通过介绍向你解释：“埃尔斯沃思先生有参与数十场探险的经验，在挑选本次探险成员时得到了强烈推荐。我相信在未来几周，他的专业知识会显得举足轻重。”\n"
"埃尔斯沃思翻了个白眼。“他的专业知识，没错……而且他还能当苦力！”他边笑著说，边把你的行李搬起走上跳板。\n"
"“快点，埃尔斯沃思！”船内的另一个声音喊道。一个长著浓密棕色胡须、看起来很粗鲁的男子出现了，示意埃尔斯沃思抓紧时间。“在启程之前，我们还有很多工作要做呢！”\n"
"“我这有点忙，曲奇。”埃尔斯沃思大声回答。然后他转向你，指了指背后：“别介意他。曲奇只是有点过度热情，不过是个好人。\n"
"“我是叫‘弗雷德里克斯’。”那个粗暴男子吼了回去。“<minicaps>詹姆斯·弗雷德里克斯</minicaps>。我发誓，有时候我觉得我是这里唯一一个为这该死的旅行作好准备的人。”他生气地低声说，“难道没人提过，用死在海上的人给船当名字不吉利吗？”\n"
"另一个声音从甲板上传来：“曲奇，麻烦你把声音压低，这儿还有人想要干活呢。”男子哼了一声，翻著白眼钻回船里。抬头望去，只见一个年轻女子斜倚在甲板的栏杆上，棕色长发扎成一个浓密的马尾，绕著脖子垂下。“嘿！你来了。”她大声对你说，“对于你能前来，肯斯勒博士非常激动。期待与你合作。”\n"
"肯斯勒博士头也不抬地低声念叨：“<minicaps>高田弘子</minicaps>女士是我们的飞机技师。和上次探险一样，我们会在现场组装飞机。不用担心——她可能是这个领域里最年轻的，但是她明白自己在做什么。\n"
"更多成员陆续到达。第一位是一名30多岁的男子，留著一小撮金色胡须，有著明亮的绿色眼睛。“<minicaps>艾弗里·克莱普尔</minicaps>先生。”肯斯勒博士把你介绍给那名男子，你们握了握手。“克莱普尔先生是埃尔斯沃思先生的……熟人。他将担任我们的南极向导。\n"
"“只要老天爷愿意行个方便。”克莱普尔开玩笑道，“说实话，我们哪怕能从冰架上下来，就已经很幸运了。”\n"
"“我坚信在有了你的技术，我们至少能走得和戴尔和莱克他们一样远。”\n"
"“这正是我担心的。”克莱普尔嘟囔著，快步地走过肯斯勒，上了跳板。他往上走，经过了埃尔斯沃思，然后两人四目相对，仿佛被定住了一般。你发誓，当他们一句话都不说僵持著时，温度下降了好几度。\n"
"“他们的关系一直是……比较好的。”肯斯勒博士小声说，“但最近却出现了一些问题。他们最好学会容忍彼此的差异。毕竟，他们会在很长一段时间里避不开对方了。”你看到克莱普尔的目光在埃尔斯沃思身上徘徊了片刻，然后他愤怒地转身进入船舱。\n"
"接下来抵达的是一位有著浅棕色皮肤和疲倦眼睛的女子，除了她的行李，还有一个挂著白色十字的巨大亮红的医疗箱摆在一起。她伸出手与肯斯勒博士握了握，而你留意到她的手在紧张地颤抖。“感谢你参加我们的这次航行， 玛拉。”\n"
"“噢，艾米。总得有人负责你的生命安全。”她回答道。肯斯勒博士抬眼将那名女子从头到脚打量一遍，有那么一刻出现了尴尬的沉默，她的脸颊微微发红。“嗯。那就这样。”她说了句，然后继续往船上走。\n"
"等她走远了，肯斯勒博士清了清喉咙。“<minicaps>玛拉·辛哈医生</minicaps>，是我们的医师。”她解释道，“说服她加入我们花了不少时间，所以尽量不要在一些无关紧要的问题上滥用她的专业技能。冻伤会是很严重的问题，还有坏疽和体温过低也是。请尽量不要惹她生气。”你不确定肯斯勒博士是否在开玩笑。\n"
"男子的声音伴随著一阵犬吠打破了这突然的寂静。“安雨！该死的，安雨，别这样乱跑!”他大吼。\n"
"“那是阿什瓦克先生。”肯斯勒博士说道，从她的名单上划去另一个名字。过了一会，你看到一只灰毛大狗向你扑来，兴奋地伸出舌头。你俯下身抚摸它，用手滑过它又厚又长的毛发。后面的男子终于追了上来，上气不接下气。“安雨……拜托，我以为我……已经把你训练好了。”他边喘边说。\n"
"“<minicaps>伊里亚·阿什瓦克</minicaps>是我们的驯犬师。”肯斯勒博士打断了他，“他负责照顾我们带来的44只雪橇犬，当然还有喂养和训练它们。”\n"
"“算上安雨是45只。”他纠正了她，然后转身与你握手。“还有，我们会在这艘船上共处一段时间，所以我们还是不要那么拘谨了。叫我‘伊里亚’就好。”\n"
"当这名男子和他的大狗登上船时，你询问肯斯勒博士是否收到了你寄出的信，是关于戴尔教授担忧的事情的。“我很清楚他的报告。”肯斯勒博士回答道，“但正如我一再告诉他的，我并不打算停止或推迟这次探险——”就在这时，脚步声从你身后传来，打断了你们的谈话。\n"
"“——说曹操，曹操到。”肯斯勒博士喃喃自语著，将视线从写字板上移开，抬起头来。来的不是别人，正是<minicaps>威廉·戴尔教授</minicaps>和他的学生<minicaps>丹佛斯</minicaps>，他俩都提著几包行李。“我很高兴你最终决定加入我们，威廉。”\n"
"“艾米。”他应声回答，“我来这里不是因为我相信你们的宗旨。我是来确保你和你的同伴不会自己送死。你根本<b>不</b>知道你将要面对的是什么。”\n"
"“那你在路上不就有的是机会好好教育我们了。”她转过身来对年轻的丹佛斯说话，而此时丹佛斯正抬头盯著油轮，表情痛苦。“丹佛斯，我希望你明白，你没有义务参加这次探险。在你经历了那么多之后……”她声音越来越小，担心地扬起眉毛，这与她平时冷淡的举止对比鲜明。\n"
"“感谢您的关心，肯斯勒博士，但我期待著有机会返回南极。我想要……需要……再去那儿。”\n"
"她跟随他的目光注视著<b>菲奥多西亚号</b>，它在波涛汹涌的大西洋海面上稳定地上下沉浮。“那好吧。我们还在把所有设备装上船。埃尔斯沃思先生会带你们前往所属的房间。”你点点头，开始和剩下的船员以及其余的探险队成员——大部分是大学的学生，还有几位独立的探险者，以及几位不同领域的研究人员——一起登船。你再一次看向空中那一缕阳光，直到它被灰云完全吞噬。"
