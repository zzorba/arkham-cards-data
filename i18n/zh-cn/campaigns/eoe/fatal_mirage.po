Your voice echoes throughout this infinite hall of mirrors. You turn around to discover that your entryway has vanished behind you. Then, in the corner of your eye, you spot a familiar figure traversing the same mists—but, no, that can't be possible. Can it?"

Both University Halls and Deck of Theodosia are already in play, but Base Camp is still set aside. Therefore, the clue value of Prison of Memories is reduced by 2 [per_investigator], meaning only 1 [per_investigator] clues are placed on it when it enters play.</i>"
