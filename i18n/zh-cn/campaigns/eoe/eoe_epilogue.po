msgid ""
"You find Ellsworth and Claypool on the aft deck of the Theodosia, enjoying a majestic view of the Atlantic. It has been several days since your escape, and the mood is one of relief, mixed with sorrow and guilt. The two men greet you as you approach, shifting aside to offer you a place to enjoy the view, as well. After a moment of contemplation, you ask what is in store for the explorers. The two of them share a knowing glance. \"A vacation, I think,\" Ellsworth says. \"A very, very long vacation.\"\n"
"\"Nothing but blue skies and warm air,\" Claypool suggests.\n"
"\"Sure. Somewhere that is on a map, preferably,\" Ellsworth adds with a gentle smile.\n"
"\"Really? I was thinking somewhere nice and remote. Just the two of us,\" Claypool hints.\n"
"You chuckle and leave the two of them to their vacation plans. Perhaps there is hope for the lot of you, after all."

"你看到埃尔斯沃思和克莱普尔在<b>菲奥多西亚号</b>的后甲板上，欣赏著大西洋的壮丽景色。你们逃离已经过去好几天了，现在的心情是解脱中夹杂著悲伤和愧疚。当你走近时，这两个男子向你打招呼，并让出一个欣赏风景的位置给你。沉思片刻后，你询问道，探险家们将面临什么。他俩交换了一个会意的眼神。“应该是度假吧，我想。”埃尔斯沃思说，“一个非常、非常长的假期。”\n"
"“只有蓝色的天空和温暖的空气。”克莱普尔说。\n"
"“没错。最好是在地图上有的地方。”埃尔斯沃思带著温和的微笑补充道。\n"
"“真的吗？我想去个偏僻的好地方。就我们两个。”克莱普尔暗示道。\n"
"你笑著离开了，留下他们俩继续计划他们的度假。看来，你们这些人或许还有希望。"

msgid ""
"You have seen Dr. Kensler face down impossible creatures and nightmarish environs, but it is this final trial that seems to rattle her most. She paces and fidgets and quietly recites sentences until finally, Dr. Sinha arrives. You'd leave her to her privacy, but she requested you stay. \"Mala,\" she says dryly, despite all of the practice. \"I was wondering—that is, I was—I would like to—\" she clears her throat and tries again. \"Would you like to have dinner again, sometime? And perhaps another show?\" she finally manages to say.\n"
"Dr. Sinha rolls her eyes, hiding a smile. \"Yes, you idiot.\"\n"
"Dr. Kensler blinks in surprise. You get the feeling she has never been called such a thing before.\n"
"\"Amy, you are highly astute, incredibly well read, and a true prodigy in your field. But when it comes to this—\" Dr. Sinha motions to and fro, indicating something in the air between them, \"you are somewhat of a dimwit.\"\n"
"To your surprise, Amy chuckles and grins. \"Yes. Yes, I suppose I am.\""

"你已经见识过肯斯勒博士如何面奇异生物和噩梦般的环境，但这最后的考验反而让她最手足无措。她坐立不安地踱著步子，静静地背诵句子，直到辛哈医生终于到来。你不想打扰她，但她要求你留下。“玛拉。”尽管练习了多次，她还是干巴巴地说著。“我在想——也就是说，我——我想——”她清了清嗓子，又试了一次。“什么时候再一起吃顿饭好吗？或者再看场表演？”她最终努力说了出来。\n"
"辛哈医生翻著白眼，掩饰著微笑。“好的，你这个傻瓜。”\n"
"肯斯勒博士惊讶地眨了眨眼睛。你感觉到她以前从来没有被这样称呼过。\n"
"“艾米，你非常机敏，博览群书，在你的领域是一个真正的天才。但当谈到这个时——”辛哈医生来回做了个手势，暗示著她们之间的气氛，“你有点像个傻瓜。”\n"
"令你惊讶的是，艾米露齿轻笑。“是的。是的，我想我确实是个笨蛋。”"

msgstr "如果威廉·戴尔教授和丹佛斯都存活："

msgid ""
"Weeks later, you step into Professor Dyer's office, where he and Danforth study an array of old, musty tomes. Some kind of esoteric diagram, filled to the brim with bizarre symbols, adorns the professor's chalkboard. \"It could be this one,\" Dyer says quietly, pointing to a different diagram in one of the tomes. You recognize the book from Dr. Kensler's possessions, and several of the others from the restricted collection of the Orne Library.\n"
"Danforth closes his eyes. \"No, no, no…\" He moves to the chalkboard and begins to erase. \"It is different. Different, different…\" Only then do the two of them spot you in the entrance. You ask them what they're studying this time.\n"
"\"'In a future existence, we shall look upon what we think our present existence, as a dream,'\" Danforth recites from Poe once more, as if in explanation."
msgstr ""
"几周后，你走进戴尔教授的办公室，在那里他和丹佛斯正研究著一堆发霉的古籍。教授的黑板上画著某种深奥的图表，上面满是奇怪的符号。“可能是这个。”戴尔平静地说著，指著其中一本书上一张不同的图表。你认出了这本书来自于肯斯勒博士的收藏，另外还有几本奥恩图书馆的限制收藏。\n"
"丹佛斯闭上了他的眼睛。“不、不、不……”他走上前开始擦黑板，“它是不同的。是不同的、不同的……”此时他们才发现你在门口。你询问他们这次在研究什么。\n"
"“‘在未来，我们将把我们所认为的现在，看作一个梦’。”丹佛斯又背诵了一遍爱伦·坡的作品，像是在解释。"

msgid "If Takada Hiroko and James \"Cookie\" Fredericks both survived:"
msgstr "如果高田弘子和詹姆斯·“曲奇”·弗雷德里克斯都存活："

msgid ""
"To your surprise, you spot both Takada and Cookie in the workshop below deck. Cookie has taken apart his revolver and is cleaning each piece individually, while Takada goes through the aeroplane parts the crew managed to break down during your hasty escape. You watch in secret for a short while as the two banter.\n"
"\"Hand me that cloth, will yeh?\"\n"
"\"I am not your employee, Cookie.\"\n"
"\"C'mon, Roko, it's right there. Jus' grab it and fling it over here.\"\n"
"\"Yes sir, do you wish for me to fetch you a spot of tea as well?\"\n"
"\"Very funny—why the hell'd you throw it all the way over there?\"\n"
"\"You told me to fling it.\"\n"
"\"To me, ya blasted—to me!\"\n"
"You smile to yourself as the back-and-forth continues. The unlikely duo seem more comfortable with one another than anybody else on the crew. Finally, a lull in the conversation gives you the opportunity to reveal yourself. They acknowledge your entrance with curt nods before going back to their work. You ask the pair what they intend to do when they get back to Arkham.\n"
"\"Roko wants to—you tell 'em,\" Cookie says.\n"
"Takada sighs and sits up, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand. \"I… I want to try to look for my father. I have asked Mr. Fredericks to join me.\" The two of them share a knowing glance. \"It is a long shot, I know. He likely crashed into the ocean many years ago. Even so, I want—I need to know. I have his logs. We should be able to find evidence. Something.\"\n"
"\"An' if not,\" Cookie adds, \"still better than sittin' around, waiting to be sent on another fool's errand like this one.\"\n"
"You nod and excuse yourself. As long as they have each other, you think the two of them will be all right."

"令你惊讶的是，你发现高田和曲奇都在甲板下面的工作间里。曲奇拆开了他的左轮手枪，正在逐个清洗零件，而高田则在检查你们匆忙逃离期间机组人员弄坏的飞机部件。你偷偷地看了一会儿这两个人互相打趣。\n"
"“把那块布递来，行不？”\n"
"“我不是你的手下，曲奇。”\n"
"“得了，小弘，就在你那。抓著它往这一飞就行了。”\n"
"“是，长官，要不要再给你泡杯茶？”\n"
"“真好笑——你为啥扔那边去了？”\n"
"“你叫我让它飞的啊。”\n"
"“往我这啊，你这该对著我啊！”\n"
"在他们像这样斗嘴时，你暗自笑著。这对看著完全不合拍的搭档似乎比团队其他成员相处得更融洽。最后，谈话的间歇，你终于有机会现身了。你一进门，他们就简单地点点头，然后继续工作。你问他俩回到阿卡姆后打算做什么。\n"
"“小弘想要——还是你来说吧。”曲奇说。\n"
"高田叹了口气，坐了起来，用戴著手套的手背抹去额头上的汗水。“我……我想要试著寻找我的父亲。我邀请了弗雷德里克斯先生陪我一起去。”他俩交换了一个会意的眼神。“我知道希望渺茫。他可能在多年前就已经坠海了。即便如此，我还是想——我还是需要知道。我有他的日志。我们应该能找到证据。找到什么。”\n"
"“就算没有。”曲奇补充说，“也比坐著干等，等待被派去做另一件像这样的傻事要好。”\n"
"你点头并告辞。只要他们有彼此支援，你觉得他俩都会没事的。"

"Eliyah sits next to the railing near the bow of the ship, his stare distant and troubled. Anyu lays on the deck with him, her head resting on his lap. She is the first to spot your approach, but neither one of them greets you. You say nothing and sit nearby, staring off into the horizon in silence.\n"
"\"It happened again, Anyu,\" he mutters at last, his voice gravelly. \"Everyone is gone. Everyone but us. Why? Why is it always us?\"\n"
"You tell Eliyah it's because the two of them are survivors, like you. Too stubborn to die. He shakes his head.\n"
"\"No. It is a curse. A burden.\" He pets Anyu softly. The dog lifts her head and gazes at you pleadingly. \"I should be dead. Twice over, now.\"\n"
"But that isn't true, you insist. And besides, he has kept Anyu safe this whole time—is that not reason enough to live?\n"
"\"No, it's the other way around,\" he says, a smile threatening to tug on his lips. \"She's the one who saved me that day. She's the one who saves me every day.\""

"伊里亚坐在船头附近的栏杆旁，他的目光看向远方，充满不安。安雨躺在他旁边，头枕在他的腿上。她最先发现你靠近，但他们都没有打招呼。你什么也没说，只是坐在旁边，默默地凝视著远方。\n"
"“又一次发生了，安雨。”他终于开口了，声音沙哑。“所有人都死了。除了我们。为什么？为什么总是我们？”\n"
"你告诉伊里亚因为他俩都是生存者，跟你一样。命硬，百折不挠。他摇了摇头。\n"
"“不。这是诅咒。是负担。”他轻轻地抚弄著安雨。大狗抬起头，恳求地看著你。“我早该死了。现在是第二次了。”\n"
"但你坚持说事实并非如此。而且，他一直以来都好好保护著安雨——难道这还不能成为活下去的理由吗？\n"
"“不，恰恰相反。”他说著，嘴角露出一丝微笑。“那天是她救了我。一直都是她在拯救我。”"
