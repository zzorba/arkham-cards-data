"Safe at last, you and the remaining members of the expedition take stock of your situation. You have lost several members of the team, but your members remain strong. Part of you knows that staying any longer would prove foolish or deadly. But a great many questions crowd your thoughts, demanding answers despite your worries. What were those uncanny, Phantasmal creatures? What happened here after Dyer’s expedition left the icy wastes behind?\n"
"You and the others discuss the situation at length and consider various plans. Some believe in the total abandonment of the expedition. But to return empty-handed now would prove disastrous for the university, frustrate the scientific community, and possibly cost the remaining crew their careers. After all, very few believed Dyer’s outlandish claims --who would believe this?\n"
"In the end, you decide to press onward. Another flight is out of the question, of course. That thing in the sky must still be out there. It was a miracle you survived one aeroplane crash, let alone two. No, there’s only one way to reach the site described in Dyer’s report now: you must travel on foot.\n"
"The decision made, you retire to get what meager rest you can before the grueling trek ahead."

"你们最终安全了，开始评估当前的处境。你们失去了几名队员，但你们的人数依然够多。你心里明白，再待下去是非常愚蠢且致命的。但心中除了担忧，还有大量疑问未能解答。那些不可思议的、幽灵般的生物到底是什么？在戴尔他们那次探险结束后，这冰封荒原发生了什么？\n"
"你和其他人详细讨论情况并考虑各种计划。有些人认为应该彻底放弃探险。但是现在空手而归对大学来说将是灾难性的，会让科学界失望，还可能会让剩下的成员丢了饭碗。毕竟，几乎没人相信戴尔古怪的说法——谁会信？\n"
"最后，你们还是决定继续前进。当然，再飞一次就不用想了。天上的那个东西肯定还在。你能在一次空难中幸存已经是个奇迹了，不要奢望第二次。没别的办法了，要到达戴尔报告中描述的地点，现在只有一种方式：步行。\n"
"作出决定后，你浑身瘫软下来，在风雪载途前抓紧时间休息。"

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team fled to the mountains</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."
msgstr "你只有一点时间去查看几名队员(无论他们是活著还是被划掉)。每次选择以下一个部分阅读，一共三次(如果<i>队伍逃进山脉中</i>，改为四次)。如果所选择的部分的游戏效果不能执行，则这次选择不计数，你可以改为再选择一个新的部分。"

msgid "The professor jumps as you approach, startled by your sudden presence. “Oh! My apologies. I thought—I thought perhaps you were…” he trails off, but he doesn’t need to finish his sentence. You know exactly how he feels. “I am a man of science, as you know. And as a man of science, I find myself struggling to…to come to terms with what we have seen thus far.” You nod and ask Dyer to explain his current working theory. “Well,” he begins, “these spectral creatures, they seem to possess some kind of ethereal physiology, very unlike the Elder Things that Lake and his team discovered and dissected the last time I was here. Those creatures might have been of alien origin, but they were…like us, in more ways than one. Flesh and organs, you see. But these…” he ponders in silence for some time. “And yet, I cannot help but wonder what the connection between the two might be?”"
msgstr "当你走近时，教授被你的突然出现吓了一跳。“噢！抱歉。我以为——我还以为你已经……”他话音渐衰，但是他已无需再说下去了。你完全明白他的感受。“你知道，我是一名从事科学研究的人。而作为一名从事科学的人，我发现我自己很难……很难接受我们迄今为止看到的东西。”你点头并请求戴尔解释他目前得出的理论。“好吧。”他开始说，“这些幽灵生物，它们似乎拥有某种飘渺的生理机能，与我上次在这里时莱克团队发现并解剖的古老者完全不同。那些生物可能源自外星，但它们又……很像我们，就许多方面来说。肉体和器官，你也看到了。但是这些……”他沉默地思考了一会儿。“而且，我不禁想知道这两者之间有什么联系呢？”"

msgid "Danforth mutters to himself over and over as you enter his tent: “‘…There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope…and I could perceive…in the countenances of my companions…that they had made up their minds to perish…’” The cadence of his voice suggests he is reciting something by memory rather than speaking his thoughts aloud. It’s only after you loudly clear your throat that he seems to notice your presence. His eyes are wide and unblinking. “Now you understand,” he says under his breath. “You have seen what I have seen.” You nod. There can be no doubt any longer. Whatever Danforth saw when he and the professor escaped their ill-fated journey is the same entity that smote your aircraft to the ground. “It knows we are here,” he says gloomily. “It sees us.”"
msgstr "你进入丹佛斯的帐篷时，他正在自言自语：现在已经没有希望了……而且在我那些同伴的脸上……我可以感觉到……他们已经下定决心要灭亡……”他声音的节奏表明，他是在背诵什么东西，而不是在说出自己的想法。你大声清了清嗓子，他才注意到你的存在。他的眼睛睁得大大的，一眨也不眨。“现在你明白了。”他低声说，“你看到了我所看到的。”你点头。这毋庸置疑。丹佛斯在他和教授逃离厄运之旅时看到的，就是把你们的飞机撞到地面的那个东西。“它知道我们在这里。”他沮丧地说，“它看见我们了。”"

msgid "Listening to Danforth gives you further insight into the madness of this place. Any one investigator may begin <b>Scenario II: To the Forbidden Peaks</b> with two additional cards drawn in their opening hand."
msgstr "听丹佛斯的一番话使你更深入洞悉了此地的疯狂。任意一位调查员可以在开始<b>冒险II：失落之峰</b>的时候额外有两张起始手牌。"

msgid "If Dr. Amy Kensler is alive:"
msgstr "如果艾米·肯斯勒博士活著："

msgid "The leader of the expedition gives you little heed as you enter her tent. Her eyes are instead glued to the microscope in front of her. She appears to be studying a glob of inky, multicolored ichor in a small petri dish. She must have recovered some of that gunk earlier. You ask if she thinks it’s safe to be studying it so closely. “Of course not,” she responds in dry monotone. “But sometimes, scientific progress requires an element of…jeopardy.” It’s true, in a way—you’re only here at all because the team decided to put themselves at risk in order to confirm the truth behind Dyer’s report. You ask Dr. Kensler what she has discovered. “Frustratingly little. Physiologically speaking, this substance is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I’m…not even completely sure it is a liquid. It seems to possess qualities of all three states of matter.” She finally sets the microscope aside, covers the petri dish, and meets your gaze. “It would be fascinating, were it not trying to kill us.”"
msgstr "你走进帐篷时，探险队的领袖并没有注意到你。相反，她的眼睛紧紧盯著面前的显微镜。她似乎在研究一个小小培养皿中的一团五彩斑斓的墨状脓液。她之前肯定自己采集了一些这种黏性物质。你问在如此近距离研究是否安全。“当然不安全了。”她干巴巴地回道。“但有时候，进步需要一种……名为危险的元素。”某种程度上来说，这确实没错——你在这里的原因都只是因为整个团队为了确认戴尔的报告背后的真相，而决定置身于危险之中。你询问肯斯勒博士的发现。“令人沮丧，几乎没有发现。从生理学上讲，这种物质和我见过的任何物质都不一样。我……甚至不太确定它是不是液体。它似乎拥有所有三种物质状态的特性。”最后，她把显微镜放在一边，盖上培养皿，与你的目光相对。“如果不是它想杀我们，这会非常吸引人。”"

msgid "Dr. Kensler's research allows you to view the situation with greater clarity. In your Campaign Log, record <i>Dr. Kensler is sharing her research with you.</i>"
msgstr "肯斯勒博士的研究使你更清楚地观察情况。在剧本日志中，记录<i>肯斯勒博士与你分享她的研究</i>。"

msgid "Dr. Kensler is sharing her research with you."
msgstr "肯斯勒博士与你分享她的研究。"

msgid "Dr. Sinha gives you a hard glare as you approach. “If you tell me that you are ‘too cold to sleep,’ so help me…” she begins, but sighs as you shake your head. “Sorry. I know, I know. Show me your wounds, then. Let me do my job.” She pulls out her medical kit and motions for you to sit on the bedroll nearby. “No signs of frostbite, hypothermia, or gangrene, that is good…” In silence, she studies the bruises and surface injuries you sustained from the crash. Finally, she clicks her tongue and shakes her head. “Uncanny,” she murmurs under her breath. You give her an inquiring stare. “Two aeroplanes,” she explains, “over a dozen of us spread between the two, and yet we sustained more injuries from the journey across the ice shelf than we did in the crash. Except for…” she trails off into harsh silence. As she dresses your wounds, you think about the meaning behind her words, the truth that she doesn’t want to say out loud. Was the entity that forced your plane to the ground really trying to kill you? Or was it simply guiding you? And if so, to what?"
msgstr "在你靠近时，辛哈医生狠狠瞪了你一眼。“如果你告诉我你是因为‘太冷了睡不著’……”她开口，但看到你摇头时叹了口气，“抱歉。我明白的。那么给我看看你的伤口吧。让我做好我的工作。”她拿出她的医疗箱，示意你坐在旁边的铺盖卷上。“没有冻伤、体温过低或坏疽的迹象，这很好……”她默默地研究著你在坠机中受的瘀伤和表面伤。最后，她咂咂舌头，摇了摇头。“太诡异了。” 她低声说。你用询问的眼神看著她。“两架飞机。”她解释道，“我们十几个人分散在两架飞机中，但我们在穿越冰架的旅途中受的伤比坠机时还要多。除了……”她的声音慢慢变小，陷入严峻的沉默。她给你包扎伤口的时候，你思考著她的话背后的含义，她不想说出来的真相。迫使你们的飞机掉到地面的那个存在真的想杀了你们吗？或者它只是在引导你们？如果是这样的话，要把你们引导去哪儿呢?"

msgid "Cookie stares into the campfire as you approach, clearly in a world of his own. His distant eyes reflect the dim, flickering firelight. Who knows what he really sees within? The moment you begin to speak, he startles out of his reverie. “Ah. S’only you,” he mutters, his voice gravelly. “Siddown. Fire’s not just for me.” You do, taking off your gloves and warming up your hands for a moment before asking Cookie what he thinks of the plan. “What do I think?” He almost laughs. “I think yer deluded, the lot of yeh. But what do I know.” You suspect aloud that he knows a lot more than the others think. “That so?” he asks in grim monotone. “’Bout war, maybe,” he growls. “But maybe that’s what this is after all. Right then. You wanna know what I know? Fine.” You listen intently as Cookie tells you his harrowing tales of the Great War, tales that would surely give you nightmares were you not already in one."
msgstr "你走近时，曲奇正盯著篝火，显然沉浸在自己的世界里。他那迷茫的眼睛反射出朦胧闪烁的火光。谁会知道他真正看到了什么？你刚开口，他就从沉思中惊醒了过来。“啊，是你啊。”他咕哝著，声音沙哑。“坐，一起烤火。”你照做了，脱下手套，暖了暖双手，然后开口询问曲奇对这个计划的看法。“我怎么想的？”他忍不住要笑了。“我觉得你们这帮人都鬼迷心窍了。但我又懂什么。”你说你怀疑他其实知道的比别人以为的要多。“这样吗？”他低沉地回问。“打仗方面的话，或许吧。”他低声咆哮，“但也许这就是事情的真相。那么，你想知道我知道些啥？行。”你全神贯注地听著曲奇讲述他关于第一次世界大战的悲惨故事，这些故事肯定会让你做噩梦，如果你还不算已经在噩梦中的话。"

msgid "Claypool is examining a map of the Ross Ice Shelf as you approach, tracing his fingers over topographical lines. “We were supposed to have better weather conditions,” he explains as you hunch over next to him. “I don’t know how or why, but something is messing with the weather patterns here. We’re getting hit with storms too sudden even for Antarctica, and the temperature variance is closer to what we would find in winter.” You ask Claypool if there’s anything that can be done to prevent further hardship. “The inclination might be to hunker down,” he replies, “and surely there are some among us who are too exhausted to go on. There are others who feel the opposite: that we should leave immediately and find safety elsewhere. I believe the best course of action is somewhere in between.” He taps the map in front of him again, beckoning you closer. “These storms are hitting fast and hard. We have to find our opening and move out the moment this one lets up,” he explains. You nod in approval."
msgstr "你走近时，克莱普尔正在研究罗斯岛冰架的地图，手指在地形线上描画著。你凑到他身边弯下腰看，他解释道：“我们本来应该有更好的天气条件的。”“我不知道是怎么回事，也不知道是为什么，但有什么东西扰乱了这里的天气模式。即便这里是南极，但袭击我们的风暴也实在太突然了，而且温度的变化也更接近我们在冬天观测的情况。”你询问克莱普尔能不能做点什么来避免更多的苦难。“按目前情况我们应该原地休整一下。”他回答道，“而且我确信我们中一些人已经筋疲力尽，没法前进了。其他人的想法恰恰相反：我们应该立即离开，到别处寻找安全的地方。我认为最好的做法是介于两者之间。”他再次轻轻敲了下放在面前的地图，示意你靠近。“这些风暴袭击得又快又猛。我们得找机会，在条件允许的时候冲出去。”他解释道。你点头表示赞同。"

msgid "In addition, if Roald Ellsworth is also alive:"
msgstr "此外，如果罗尔德·埃尔斯沃思还活著："

msgid ""
"Curious, you pry a bit, asking Claypool what the deal is between him and Ellsworth. “Huh? Oh, Roald? We—that—” he stammers, avoiding your gaze. “He is just so damn stubborn. And hard to read.” You raise an eyebrow. “Okay, it is more than that. He is a loner. By his very nature. Getting close to somebody like that…” he sighs, trying to muster up the words. “…is difficult. For both parties.”\n"
"But worth it, you observe aloud.\n"
"“Yes, I suppose it can be,” he replies with a smile. “Sometimes.”"
msgstr ""
"你很好奇，就试著向克莱普尔打听他和埃尔斯沃思之间是怎么回事。“哈？噢，罗尔德？我们——嗯——”他结结巴巴地说著，躲避著你的目光。“他就是太固执了。而且也很难读懂他。”你挑了挑眉毛。“好吧，不止如此。他总是独来独往。他天性如此。要接近这样一个人……”他叹了口气，努力组织语言，“……是很困难的。对双方而言都是如此。”\n"
"但这值得，你说出了你的想法。\n"
"“是的，我想确实如此。”他微笑著回答。“有时是的。”"

msgid "Ellsworth throws you a pocket telescope as you meander through the camp, searching for a task. “You look free. Follow me,” he demands. You roll your eyes and follow begrudgingly as he leads you out into the snowy wilds. Over the howling winds, you ask loudly where he is taking you. “Higher,” Ellsworth responds simply. For nearly an hour, you follow him up a treacherous trail through rocky crags to an icy precipice overlooking the ice shelf. Black, jagged mountains loom in the distance, barely visible through the harsh snowfall. “There,” he says, pointing between two of the peaks. “What does that look like, to you?” You raise the telescope up to your eyes, careful not to press the cold glass against your skin lest it freeze there. Magnified by the device’s lens, you can just make out a narrow pass between the peaks. Perhaps this would be the optimal route to take tomorrow? You convey your thoughts to Ellsworth, and he nods along. “I agree. I’ll mark it on our map when we get back to camp.”"
msgstr "当你在营地中漫步，寻找能做的事时，埃尔斯沃思扔给你一个袖珍望远镜。“你看著没事干。跟我来。”他要求道，你翻了个白眼，不情不愿地跟在他后面，而他带著你走进了白雪皑皑的荒野。在呼啸的狂风中，你大声询问他要把你带到哪里去。“高处。”埃尔斯沃思简短地回答。在将近一个小时的时间里，你跟著他沿著一条危险的小路穿过岩石峭壁来到一个可以俯瞰冰架的冰崖。锯齿状的黑色山脉隐约出现在远处，在严酷的大雪中几乎看不见。“那儿。”他说著，指著两座山峰之间，“你觉得那像什么？”你举起望远镜，小心地不把冰冷的玻璃贴在你的皮肤上，以免冻结住。被设备放大后，你恰好能看到山峰之间狭窄的通道。也许这是明天的最佳路线？你把你的想法告诉埃尔斯沃思，他也点头附和。“我同意。等我们回到营地，我会在地图上做记号。”"

We will have to be smart about our supplies if we are to continue this folly.” She spits that last word out like a curse, leaving you to ponder her feelings about the expedition. “Well, come on, don’t just stand there. Help me with this,” she scolds. You nod and get to work."
msgstr "高田把你们所有剩余的补给和预备品整齐地放在她面前。“在你发问之前：是的，我现在负责大家的物资管理。”她解释道，“我们的两架飞机坠毁了，与其他成员也分开了。我们必须在补给上放聪明点——如果我们还打算继续这愚蠢的旅程。”她诅咒般地吐出最后一个词，让你思考她对这次探险的感受。“好了，来吧，别光站在那了。过来帮忙。”她训斥道。你点点头，开始干活。"

msgid "You find Eliyah on the outskirts of the camp, tending to the dogs and making sure they are ready for tomorrow’s journey. His trusty companion Anyu is by his side as always. The dog’s tail slaps back and forth rapidly as you approach. “Oh, hey there,” Eliyah says over his shoulder when he realizes Anyu’s spotted you. “Calm down, will you, Anyu?” he scolds playfully, reaching down to ruffle her ears. You ponder aloud if she realizes the danger you’re all in. “Oh, she knows,” Eliyah responds. “She is rather good at making all the troubles of the world fade away. It wouldn’t be the first time.” You wonder with a bit of curiosity what other adventures Eliyah and Anyu might have been on in the past. But before you can ask, a cold flask hits you square in the chest and tumbles into your hands. “Drink,” Eliyah offers. “It’ll warm you up.” He sits down and drinks from a flask of his own, motioning for you to join him. You do, gulping down a large swallow. It burns on its way down. Anyu lies between the two of you, nudging your hand pleadingly. No more words are spoken, but Eliyah is right. For just a moment, everything is okay."
