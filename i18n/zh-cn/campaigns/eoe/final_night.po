"You would hesitate to call the darkened pit you find yourself in \"safe\" by any means, but you feel as though this is as good a place as any to rest. It was hard enough to tell the time with the sun always lingering in the Antarctic sky—now, deep underground with no sunlight to speak of, it is impossible. When one of your companions checks their pocketwatch and informs the team that fourteen hours have passed since you went underground, the response is one of utter disbelief. You do not remember traveling that long, but your body is weary enough to prove it.\n"
"In gloomy silence, you and the others set up camp once more. Your numbers have dwindled to only yourself and the few experts who remain from those originally introduced to you by Dr. Kensler. The rest of the students and researchers are either back at the barrier camp where you first disembarked from the Theodosia, or… no longer with you.\n"
"The cavern is easily large enough for what few of you remain, and the icy floor brittle enough to stake down your tents. Even so, it does not truly feel safe. You wonder if you will ever feel safe again."

"你犹豫自己身处的黑暗之坑是否能称为“安全”，但不管怎样你觉得这是一个休息的好地方。太阳在南极上空徘徊永不落下的时候，分辨时间已经够难了——而现在，深处地底，根本没有阳光，要靠阳光分辨时间是更加不可能的了。当你的一个同伴看了看怀表，告诉其他人自从进入地下已经过去了14个小时，其他人的反应是完全不敢相信。你不记得走了那么长的路，但你的身体疲倦得足以证明这一点。\n"
"在阴郁寂静中，你和其他人又搭起了营地。队伍人数已经减少到除了你只有肯斯勒博士一开始介绍给你的少数专家了。其他学生和研究员要么回到了第一次从<b>菲奥多西亚号</b>登陆的屏障营地，要么……已经不在了。\n"
"洞穴足够大，足以容纳你们剩下的这点人，而冰冷的地面也足够硬，足以支撑你们的帐篷。即便如此，它也并不会真正让人感到安全。你想知道你是否还有机会能再次感受到安全。"

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team was guided to the hidden tunnel</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."
msgstr "你只有一点时间去查看几名队员(无论他们是活著还是被划掉)。每次选择以下一个部分阅读，一共三次(如果<i>队伍被引导到隐秘隧道</i>，改为四次)。如果所选择的部分的游戏效果不能执行，则这次选择不计数，你可以改为再选择一个新的部分。"

msgid "The professor, who was originally reluctant to join the expedition at all, seems to have completely changed his tune… although this new side of him worries you even more. \"I understand now why Danforth wanted to return,\" he explains. \"It is calling to us. Can you not feel it? Can you not hear it? It wants us to keep going.\" You ask him what 'it' he refers to, and he gestures vaguely around the both of you. \"It. I don't know. These phantasms don't act like independent creatures, do you not think? Perhaps they are controlled by a greater force. Or…\" he considers his next words carefully. \"Perhaps they are all one and the same. Extensions of one nameless madness. I wonder—what would Danforth and I have discovered had we not fled? Perhaps we could have avoided all this suffering…\""
msgstr "原先非常抗拒参加这次探险的教授似乎完全改变了他的态度……尽管他这新的一面更让你担心。“我现在明白丹佛斯为什么想回来了。”他解释道，“它在召唤我们。你感觉不到它吗？你听不到它的声音吗？它希望我们继续前进。”你询问他“它”指的是什么，而他在你俩周围比了个含糊的手势。“它。我不知道。这些幻影不像独立的生物，你不觉得吗？也许他们被更强大的力量控制著。或者……”他仔细考虑著接下来要说的话，“也许它们都是同一个个体。是某种不可名状的疯狂的延伸。我很好奇——如果丹佛斯和我没有逃走，我们会发现什么呢？也许我们本可以免受这一切的……”"

msgid "You don't speak to Danforth that night. He is the one who speaks, but to what entity, you cannot tell. At first you believe him to be mumbling to himself as he often does, but soon you realize it is a dialogue you only partially hear. \"We are close,\" he declares quietly. \"I followed, just as you showed me. Just a little further, and I will see you again. We can be together again. We can be… whole.\" Finally, you decide you have heard enough. You clasp a hand on Danforth's shoulder, startling him. You swear you see just the slightest tinge of something misty leaking from his eyes as he turns around, but then he wipes them with his sleeve, and it is gone. \"Oh, it is just you,\" he comments. \"W-well then. We should get some rest, should we not? We have a long day ahead of us.\""
msgstr "那晚你没有跟丹佛斯说话。他是唯一说话的人，但是在跟谁说，你却不得而知。一开始，你认为他一如既往在自言自语，但很快你就意识到，你只是听到了这段对话的一部分。“我们很近了。”他平静地宣告著，“我完全跟随著你的指引。只要再前进一点点，我就能再见到你了。我们就可以再次在一起了。我们就……完整了。”最后，你觉得自己听的够多了。你将一只手搭在丹佛斯的肩膀上，他吓了一跳。你发誓，当他转过身来的时候，你恰好看到有一种模糊的雾状物从他的眼睛里漏出来，但随后他用袖子擦了擦，就不见了。“噢，是你啊。”他说道，“那、那好吧。我们应该休息一下了，对吧？我们还有很多路要走。”"

msgid "Listening to Danforth gives you further insight into the madness of this place. Any one investigator may begin <b>Scenario IV: The Heart of Madness</b> with two additional cards drawn in their opening hand."
msgstr "听丹佛斯的一番话使你更深入洞悉了此地的疯狂。任意一位调查员可以在开始<b>冒险IV：疯狂之心</b>的时候额外有两张起始手牌。"

msgstr "如果艾米·肯斯勒博士活著，但在剧本日志中并未记录著<i>肯斯勒博士马上就要明白了</i>："

msgid "Dr. Kensler is in an absolute panic when you enter her tent. Her gaze rises to meet yours for just a moment before she goes back to rummaging through her materials. \"It is here somewhere, I know it…\" she mumbles. You've never seen Dr. Kensler in such disarray before. \"Ah! Here.\" The book she identifies is not one of her treatises on biology or a textbook filled with anatomical diagrams. It is an old, moldy tome unrelated to any of the sciences, written in French. \"I know I saw it in here…\" she mumbles, scouring the tome's pages for a specific passage. You sit nearby in silence, almost too frightened to ask anything. Dr. Kensler has changed completely from her usual cold, stoic demeanor. \"Here!\" She marks her page and snaps back to you. \"Can I trust you?\" You nod your head. Whatever Dr. Kensler has found, you get the feeling she is only showing you because you have shared in her discoveries up until this point. She opens the tome to a depiction of some unfamiliar, cosmic hierarchy-the kind of absurd dogmatic theory that any self-respecting scientist would scoff at. \"Henry Armitage was the only other person at the university who did not approve of this undertaking. He is the one who showed me this, after Dyer submitted his report.\" She points to the section of the diagram illustrating the Earth, and you note the pattern of intersecting lines at its edge. \"The south pole,\" she says. \"At the edge of the Earth, where the lines meet. The culmination of eldritch forces, he said. Superstitious nonsense, I presumed. But my research proves otherwise. These creatures—these phantom mirages, eidolons of broken minds, they did not arrive here. They were always here. From the very beginning. Do you understand?\" She grips her miasma sample tight. \"And we… we weren't the first to stumble across them.\""

"当你进入肯斯勒博士的帐篷时，她非常惊慌。她的目光与你的目光相对了一会儿，然后她又继续翻找她的材料。“它就在这儿某个地方，我知道的……”她喃喃地说。你从没见过肯斯勒博士如此混乱。“啊！这里。”她找出的这本书不是她的生物学论文，也不是充满解剖图例的教科书。这是一本古老发霉的著作，与科学无关，是用法语写的。“我知道我在这里见过它……”她喃喃地说，仔细翻阅著这本书，寻找特定的一段。你静静地坐在旁边，怕得什么都不敢问。肯斯勒博士完全改变了她平时冷漠、平淡的态度。“就是这儿！”她在页面上做了标记，然后啪地一声合上书转向你。“我能信任你吗？”\n"
"你点头。无论肯斯勒博士发现了什么，你都觉得她会给你看只是因为到目前为止她一直在分享她的发现给你。她打开书本，翻到一段内容，描述的是某种陌生的宇宙层级体系——任何有自尊心的科学家都会嘲笑这是荒谬的教条理论。“亨利·阿米蒂奇是大学里仅有的另一个不赞成这个项目的人。在戴尔提交了他的报告之后，是他给我看了这个。”她指著图解中地球的部分，你注意到在地球边缘相交的线构成的图案。“南极。”她说，“在地球边缘，线条相交之处。他说，这是邪恶意象的巅峰。我以前认为这不过是迷信的无稽之谈。但我的研究证明并非如此。这些生物，这些虚幻的幻景，破碎心灵的幻灵，它们并没有来到这里。它们一直在这儿。自最初之时。明白了吗？”她紧紧抓住瘴气样本。“而且我们……我们不是第一个发现它们的。”"

msgid "Dr. Kensler's research allows you to view the situation with greater clarity. In your Campaign Log, record <i>Dr. Kensler understands the true nature of the miasma.</i>"
msgstr "肯斯勒博士的研究使你更清楚地观察情况。在剧本日志中，记录下<i>肯斯勒博士理解了瘴气的本质</i>。"

msgid "For the first time since the expedition set out, Dr. Sinha seeks you out personally, inquiring after your wounds. You show her your injuries, and she nods along, holding back her usual castigation. She tends your wounds in silence until she finally speaks. \"I have lost so many patients, I can no longer keep track,\" she reveals. \"Most of the time, there was nothing to be done. That is just the nature of things, I suppose. We are fragile creatures, after all. Bend us just a little bit, and we tend to break.\" She winds a bandage around your arm with practiced precision, but you spot the subtle shaking in her hands. \"I went into this profession because I could not stand seeing people hurt. It was a pretty foolish decision, looking back. After all, in this profession, all I do is see people hurt.\" You ask her if there is any satisfaction in seeing them healthy, once her work is done. \"Of course,\" she replies, after a long sigh. \"But this time…\" She averts her gaze from your eyes, her voice practically a whisper. \"I do not think I will get that satisfaction. Do you?\""
msgstr "自从探险队出发以来，辛哈医生第一次亲自来找你，询问你的伤势。你给她看你的伤，她点点头，忍住了平时的责备。她默默地照料你的伤口，直到她开口。“我失去了太多的病人，多到我再也记不下了。”她说，“大多数时候，我都无能为力。我想这就是事情的本质。毕竟，我们是脆弱的生物。轻轻一弯就折成两段。”她熟练地用绷带缠绕你的手臂，但你发现她的手在微微颤抖。“我入行是因为我无法忍受仅仅只能眼睁睁看著人们受到伤害。但现在回想起来，那是个相当愚蠢的决定。毕竟，在这个行业里，我所做的就是看著别人受伤。”你问她，在她完成工作后，看到人们健康是否会有任何满足感。“那当然。”她长叹一声后回答，“但这一次……”她把目光从你的眼睛上移开，她的声音轻得像耳语。“我不认为我会得到那种满足。你呢？”"

msgid "Cookie draws his Colt as vou approach. You can tell from his bloodshot eyes and shaking hand that he has not rested in some time. The moment he realizes it's only you, he apologizes and lowers the weapon. \"Thought you were one of—well y'know,\" he explains half-heartedly. You remark that you're lucky he has any trigger discipline left. \"Trigger discipline,\" he scoffs. A long pause hangs in the air. \"C'mon. Help me with the fire.\" In silence, you and the grizzled veteran set what remains of your firewood in the center of the camp and attempt to light it. In the cold, damp conditions, it takes almost half an hour of effort before the fire is lit. It eagerly consumes the kindling, casting dancing shadows along the icy walls of the cavern. Finally, Cookie breaks the silence. \"This,\" he utters decisively. \"I remember this.\" You don't bother to ask—you only have to meet his faraway gaze to know he is referring to the feeling of impending death permeating the camp. \"Piece of advice\" he offers, \"when the time comes, you can't hesitate. Don't matter how many of us are left. Don't matter what manner of doom yer staring down. You flinch, you die.\" You nod in understanding. You get the feeling Cookie's never flinched once in his life."
msgstr "你走近时，曲奇拔出了他的柯尔特手枪。你可以从他充血的眼睛和颤抖的手看出，他有一段时间没有休息过了。当他意识到是你时，他道歉并放下了武器。“我还以为是——嗯，你懂的。”他敷衍地解释著。你说他还能管的住扣扳机的手，自己真是走运。“呵，管的住手。”他语气讥讽地回应。然后是一段时间的沉默。“好了。来帮我生下火。”在沉默中，你和头发花白的老兵把剩下的柴火放在营地中心，试图点燃它。在寒冷潮湿的环境下，你们花了将近半小时的努力才生起了火。它急切地消耗著燃料，在洞穴冰冷的墙壁上投下跳动的影子。最终，曲奇打破了沉默。“这个。”他决然地说道。“我记得这个。”你不必费心去问——只要看看他那凝望远处的目光，你就知道他指的是弥漫在营地里，即将到来的死亡的感觉。“给你个忠告。他说，“到时候，你绝不能犹豫。”不管我们还剩下多少人。不管你面对的是怎样的灾厄。一旦退缩，你就会死。”你点头表示理解。你感觉曲奇这辈子从没退缩过一次。"

msgid "Claypool studies the icy walls as you approach, his brow furrowed with concern. \"It should be warmer here,\" he notes, \"but even without windchill, it is almost 10 degrees colder.\" Just then, something moves inside the ice—a shadow, perhaps, or something reflecting off its surface. You and Claypool instinctively back away as the fleeting darkness swirls and vanishes. No light behind you could have cast that shadow. \"There is… something wrong with this ice,\" Claypool whispers. \"This cold, it is unnatural. Dyer's report described these inner structures as warm and habitable, but this is…\" You share a knowing glance. \"We need to be prepared. For anything.\""
msgstr "当你走近时，克莱普尔研究著冰冷的墙壁，他的眉头紧锁著。“这里明明应该更暖和些的。”他说，“但即使没有寒风，这里也要冷近10度。”就在这时，有什么东西在冰里移动——也许是影子，或者是冰面反射出来的什么东西。黑影旋转并转瞬即逝，你和克莱普尔本能地后退。你身后的光投不出这样的影子。“这冰……有问题。”克莱普尔低声说。“这种寒冷，是反常的。戴尔的报告将这些内部建筑描述为温暖宜居，但这……”你们会意地对视一眼。“我们需要做好准备。做好能面对一切的准备。"

msgid "You already know what Ellsworth is thinking when he approaches you, a lantern in one of his hands and an icepick in the other. \"You up for a little trip?\" He hands the lantern to you, and together you break off from the camp. You make quiet, cautious conversation as you explore the icy depths, covering far more ground between the two of you than you could with the rest of your team and what is left of your supplies. \"You must think me some manner of mad or foolish,\" he guesses after an hour of fast-paced travel. \"Always going off alone, getting into danger like this. Into places we should not end up.\" You shrug and point out the fact that you, too, are here with him. \"Right. So I doubt your opinion of me is unbiased,\" he jokes. A blast of chill, putrid air wafts through the cave like the exhale of a monstrous beast, with you down its throat. \"Well, for what it is worth, I sure am glad to have you here,\" the explorer admits, a quiver of hesitation in his voice. \"Look—\" he points ahead at a fork in the tunnel. The foul gust dies down around you, but it clearly came from the left-hand path. \"Something that way is circulating air. That has to mean something, right?\" You nod in agreement, but you sure as hell don't like the smell of it…"

"你已经知道埃尔斯沃思走近你的时候在想什么了，他一手拿著提灯，一手拿著冰锥。“跟我一起走一段？”他把提灯递给你，然后你们一起离开营地。你们在探索冰冷深渊的路上谨慎地低声交谈。你们两个人走到了和队伍里的其他人都到不了的遥远地方。“你一定认为我疯了，要不就是傻了。”经过一小时快节奏的跋涉后，他说道，总是独自前行，陷入这样的危险。进入我们不该去的地方。”你耸耸肩，指出了事实：你也和他在一起。“没错。所以我怀疑你对我的看法是否公正。”他开玩笑说。\n"
"一股阴冷、恶臭的空气从洞穴里吹出来，就像一只巨兽呼出的气，要把你吞入它的喉咙。“嗯，不管怎样，我很高兴有你在这里。”这位探险家承认道，他的声音有些犹豫。“看——”他指著前方隧道的岔路口。那股恶臭的风在你周围渐渐消失了，但它显然是来自左边的路。“那边有什么在做空气回圈。这肯定意味著什么，对吧？”你点头表示赞同，但你肯定不喜欢这该死的味道……"

She has been preparing in secret—you can tell from the provisions she keeps from the rest of the party, the aeroplane parts she tinkers with in her spare time. \"You are right.\" She sighs in response to your allegation. \"I was thinking of going back. Breaking off in secret, heading back to the ice shelf, and getting as far away from this damned place as possible. But…\" she glances at the rest of the team, their mood hopeful despite the ominous feeling in the air. \"I would never make it back on my own. Do not worry. I am not going anywhere. Go ahead, take whatever is in that pack for yourself.\" You choose to trust her, though you cannot help but worry. Her usual monotone is full of jaded cynicism, but this is different. She sounds as though she has given up. \"Why are you still here?\" she asks after a long while. \"You have what you came for.\" You shake your head and tell her that you are here for her. She chances the hint of a smile. \"Well that is awful foolish of you. But… thanks.\""
msgstr "你来找高田不是为了寻求帮助，而是为了谴责。她一直在秘密地准备——你从她对团队其他成员保密的备用品，和她在闲暇时修补的飞机零件中就可以看出。“没错。”她叹了口气作为对你的回应，“我在考虑回去。偷偷离队，返回冰架，尽可能地远离这个该死的地方。但是……”她瞥了一眼其他队员，尽管空气中弥漫著不祥的气味，但他们的内心还是充满了希望。“靠我自己是永远回不去的。不要担心。我哪儿都不去。去吧，包里的东西你想要啥就自己拿。”你选择信任她，尽管你还是有些担心。她平常单调的声音充满了厌倦及冷嘲热讽，但现在不同了。她听起来好像已经放弃了。“你怎么还在这儿？”过了好一会儿，她问道，“你已经得到你想要的了。”你遥遥头，告诉她你是为她而来的。她稍稍露出一丝微笑。“哈，那你真是个傻瓜。但是……谢谢了。"

Stop! You're making too much noise!\" Eliyah shouts. When he sees you approach, he motions for you to help pull her away. \"Can you grab her collar? We need to get her back to the tents.\" After some struggling, you finally manage to wrench the dog away and lead her back to camp. She whines the entire way, her snout twinging. \"She's got the scent of something,\" Eliyah says once she is calm. \"Never seen her act this way before.
