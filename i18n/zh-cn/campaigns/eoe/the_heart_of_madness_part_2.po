"The facility is even older—and stranger—beyond the threshold of the ancient gateway. Who knows how many eons this place has slept undisturbed while the Earth changed and developed on the other side? Perhaps it would have remained so forever, had the site not been disturbed. But it's too late to change the past. All you can do now is work to prevent a terrible future.\n"
"Dim luminescence fills the eerie halls, powered by some form of advanced energy, like electricity. Behind you, a kaleidoscopic wall of miasma stitches itself together to block your escape. You are trapped here, perhaps forever. A web of expansive halls extends outward from the gateway, carved from smooth stone and covered in ancient murals and alien heiroglyphs. The air here feels thinner. The light bends and oscillates, distorting your vision like an optical illusion. Is this reality… or a mirage?\n"
"Your party studies the murals along the walls for many hours. They depict an ancient, unfamiliar history. An alternative history of the Earth. A very different history than any you could have possibly imagined."

"远古大门另一端的设施甚至更为古老和奇异。谁能知道当地球在另一端在不断变化发展的时候，此处有多少亿年没有被打扰过了？如果这个地点没有受到打扰，也许它会永远保持这样的状态。但现在已经太迟了，你们无法改变过去。你现在所能做的就是努力防止可怕的未来。\n"
"昏暗的光线充满了诡异的大厅，由某种先进的能量驱动，类似电能。在你身后，一堵千变万化的瘴气缝合的墙挡住了你的出路。你被困在了这里，可能是永远。宽阔的大厅从大门向外延伸，由光滑的石头雕刻而成，上面覆盖著古代壁画和异星文字。这里的空气感觉更稀薄。光弯曲振荡著，像视错觉般扭曲你的所见。这是现实……还是幻景？\n"
"你的团队花了好几个小时研究墙上的壁画。它们描绘了一段古老而陌生的历史。地球的另一段历史。一段你完全想像不到的历史。"

"Dr. Kensler explains everything as she studies the ancient murals. \"The Elder Things were travelers. Colonizers. They came to the Earth over a billion years ago,\" she says, citing Professor Dyer's own notes. \"But they were not the first ones here. This place, all of this—it was ancient even then.\" She runs her hands along the mural as she explains what she has learned. \"But it is not an entity trapped within.\"\n"
"You ask what she means, alarmed by this new understanding. She turns to face you, her eyes aflame with inspiration. \"I had been studying their physiology, attempting to discern how they could exist the way they do, without shape, without matter, without state. But I was going about it all wrong. One cannot study the biology of something inorganic. See, it is not a creature, not truly. It is more akin to…\" she hesitates, attempting to find the right words. \"It is an alternate dimension. Another reality, superimposed on ours. A sentient microcosm of all that is. Not composed of organic life, but a mockery of it.\"\n"
"This newfound understanding of the phantasms you have encountered and the mirages you have seen put everything into context. They were not monsters you were slaying, they were figments of a false reality. One that may yet come to pass. You ask Dr. Kensler if there is any hope to stop such a force from escaping.\n"
"\"It is not a living thing. It cannot be killed. Only contained. The Elder Thing's facility held five pylons that used its essence to power their civilization, but after this long, I cannot imagine they still function. But perhaps…\" she trails off, formulating a plan. Finally, her eyes widen with realization. \"I know what must be done. I know how to stop it. You must find these pylons and destroy them—doing so will bring the entire compound down. In the meantime…\" she hefts her backpack off of her shoulder, dropping it to the ground. \"I… I must be off now. There is no time to spare.\"\n"
"You object to her sudden departure, but her mind is made up. She backs away, giving one last lingering glance at her companions, before sprinting away. You hope she knows what she's doing… for all of your sakes."

"肯斯勒博士一边研究古代壁画，一边解释了一切。“这些古老者是旅者。殖民者。它们在十多亿年前就来到了地球。”她引用戴尔教授的笔记说，“但它们不是最早到达这儿的。这个地方，所有这一切——在那时都是远古的存在。”她一边用手摸著壁画，一边解释她了解到的东西。“但这个存在并非被困于此。”\n"
"你问她这是什么意思，你被这种新的理解吓到了。她转过身来面对著你，眼睛闪耀著智慧的光芒。“我一直在研究它们的生理，试图辨别它们是如何以它们现在的方式存在的，没有形状、没有物质、没有状态。但我的想法全错了。无机物哪来的生物学呢。看，它都不是个生物，不是真实的。它更像是……”她犹豫了一下，试图找到合适的词语，“它是另一个维度。另一种现实，叠加在我们的现实上。所有这一切都是一个有意识的微观宇宙。它不是由有机生命组成的，只是在模仿有机体而已。\n"
"对你所遇到的幽灵和你所看到的幻景的全新解释，使一切都说得通了。它们不是被你杀死的怪物，它们只是虚假现实中的虚假之物。而这虚假却将可能成为现实。你询问肯斯勒博士，是否还有希望阻止这股力量逃跑。\n"
"“它不是活物。它不能被杀死。只能被控制。古老者的设施里有五个高塔，在利用它的精华为它们的文明提供动力，但过了这么久，恐怕它们已无法工作了。但也许……”她说到这里，开始制定一个计划。终于，她睁大眼睛表示想通了。“我知道必须要做什么了。我知道该怎么阻止它。你必须找到这些塔并摧毁它们——这样做会摧毁这整个区域。与此同时……”她把背包从肩上卸下，扔到了地上。“我……我现在必须得走了。没有时间可以浪费了。”\n"
"你反对她的突然离开，但她已经下定了决心。她后退了几步，踌躇地看了同伴最后一眼，然后飞快地跑开了。看在你们所有人的份上……你希望她知道自己在做什么。"

"You can glean only a fraction of the truth hidden within these ancient murals, but what you discover is almost too impossible to believe. When the Elder Things came to the Earth over a billion years ago, they colonized not just Antarctica, but the entirety of the planet. And when they did, this place—and the entity that dwells within—was already here.\n"
"They built their complex around it, to study the primordial being within, to greater understand it, and in doing so, attracted forces beyond even their ken. The gateway and its seals were constructed to contain it, but ages of disrepair have left it weak and ineffective. You suspect it was the presence of intelligent life on Antarctica—the humans who began to explore its long-dead peaks and icy plains—that stirred the entity within.\n"
"The murals tell of the facility's structure, of five pylons created not only to contain the creature's essence, but to power the whole of Elder Thing civilization. You can only imagine that destroying these pylons would reduce the entire compound—perhaps even the entirety of the mountain it is built beneath—to rubble. You don't know if you can truly destroy or contain this nameless horror, but you have no choice but to try. If it continues to escape, the very concept of reality will be rewritten to its whim. There will be nothing left but the mirage. Nothing left but twisted, horrid imagination. A nightmare from which there is no awakening."

"在这些古代壁画中，你只能收集到隐于其中的一小部分真相，但你的发现已经几乎令人难以置信了。当古老者在十多亿年前来到地球时，它们不仅殖民了南极，还殖民了整个地球。而当它们做著这些的时候，这里——以及住在里面的存在——其实早就在了。它们在它周围建造了建筑群，以研究内部的远古存在，从而更好地了解它。而在这过程中，吸引了甚至超出它们所知的力量。大门和封印是用来控制它的，但年久失修使它变得衰弱失效。你怀疑是因为南极洲上智慧生命的出现——开始探索其长期沉寂的山峰和冰原的人类——唤醒了潜藏于此的存在。\n"
"壁画说明了这个设施的结构，五座塔的建造不仅是为了控制那生物的本质，还为整个古老者文明提供动力。你只能想到，摧毁这些塔将会使整个区域——甚至可能使它所在的整座山——变成废墟。你不知道你是否能真正摧毁或遏制这无名的恐怖，但你别无选择，只能尝试。如果它继续逃离，现实的概念本身将被它随心所欲地改写。现实中除了幻景，其他什么都不会有了。除了扭曲可怕的想像，什么都不会有了。只有永远无法醒来的噩梦。"

"When you awaken, the facility is dark and quiet once more. You pull your companions to their feet and retreat back to the surface, wondering if you are too late to stop the entity beyond the gate from escaping.It is quiet. Peaceful. There are no more signs of icy phantasms, eerie mirages, or alien entities.\n"
"Back in the city nestled within the mountains, you take notes, photographs, and rubbings. The trip back to the ice shelf is swift and easy. Not even the cold weather fights you as you make your way back to the barrier camp. It is as if the entire continent of Antarctica has given itself over to you. You consider taking this time to continue studying the environment, but in the end, you decide to head back with your extensive findings. The sky is clear and beautiful as your ship departs from the ice shelf, heading north.\n"
"Still, you are troubled. The entity that was once sealed beyond the Elder Thing's gateway was gone. There was almost no trace of it when you fled. Which can only mean it escaped, and could be anywhere. Or everywhere. Your thoughts turn dreadful. You remind yourself of the strange, vivid mirages the creature seemed to control.

"不过，你还是有点不安。那个曾经被封印在古老者所建大门彼端的实体已经不在了。你逃跑的时候几乎没有看到任何它的痕迹。这只能说明它已经逃脱了，而它可能在任何地方。或者说一切地方。你越想越害怕。你回想起这个生物控制著的奇异生动的幻景。那些逼真的幻觉。你看著你的手掌，想知道它们就是原本的模样，还是近似的复制品。你周围的空气在闪烁著微光。\n"

"Suddenly, there is blast of warm air, and a sound like a tremendous exhalation. The air shimmers with the distortion of a mirage, and you watch in shock as the rushing miasma suddenly recoils. It collapses upon itself and retreats back into the mountainside just as the avalanche begins. Bright blue cracks spread rapidly along the walls. Without the pylons, the integrity of not just the facility within the mountain, but the entire city, is compromised. The icy floor cracks open. The cyclopean architecture of the alien city begins to sink into the snow.\n"
"Then you hear it: the roaring engine of an aeroplane overhead. The last of Takada's three planes soars over the city, and familiar shouts echo throughout the ancient, ruinous streets. \"There they are! By that tunnel! Quickly!\" Two sledges slide into view, pulled by the remainder of the dogs Eliyah left at the barrier camp, and manned by several members of the crew of the Theodosia. You cannot hold back your surprise or joy at the sight. They motion frantically for you to join them, their gazes fixed on the collapsing mountain.\n"
"At the last possible second, you hear another voice emanating from within the tunnel. \"Wait!\" Dr. Kensler emerges from the darkness, waving and hollering. \"Wait for me!\" She hops onto the sledge, and together, you race off into the foothills as the city collapses into the ice behind you.\n"
"One of the crewmates explains that they fixed up the last of the aeroplanes and decided to use it to look for you, even knowing the risks. \"When we spotted you entering that huge cavern without most of your gear, we thought you might need a rescue. Didn't expect that to be quite this literal,\" he says. You tell him his timing couldn't be more perfect.\n"
"The moment you make it back to the ice shelf, Dr. Kensler instructs the crew to prepare for departure. You barely even break down the barrier camp. It doesn't matter anymore. All that matters is getting out of this place with your lives intact—and with all the evidence you have found, of course.\n"
"But still, you have questions. Once safely aboard the Theodosia, you confront Dr. Kensler and ask her what she did back in the facility. The entity was chasing you, and then, suddenly… \"I told you, it is not a living creature,\" she explains. \"As such, it cannot be killed. At least, not by our standards. But it has some semblance of sentience, yes? It knows our desires. Our hopes. Our fears.\" You note aloud that Dr. Kensler is using the present tense. She clenches her jaw. The slightest hint of distortion wavers in the air around her. \"I… I made a deal,\" she whispers. \"It was the only way.\""

"突然，有一股暖风吹来，还有一个像巨大呼气声的声音。空气中闪烁著扭曲的幻景，而你震惊地看到汹涌的瘴气突然退却了。就在雪崩开始的时候，它自我崩解并退回到山腰。明亮的蓝色裂缝沿著墙壁迅速蔓延。没有了高塔，不仅是山中设施，连同整个城市的结构都受到了牵连。冰结的地板裂开了。这座异星生物的城市的巨大建筑开始沉入雪中。\n"
"然后你听到了：头顶上飞机引擎的轰鸣。高田三架飞机中仅存的那架，正在城市上空盘旋，熟悉的喊声回荡在古老的破败街道上。“他们在那儿！在隧道旁边！快！”两辆雪橇滑进了视野，由伊里亚留在屏障营地里的其余随行犬拉著，载著几名<b>菲奥多西亚号</b>的船员。看到这一幕，你又惊又喜，不能自已。他们疯狂地示意 你上来，而他们的眼睛紧盯著正在坍塌的山脉。\n"

"一名成员解释说，他们修好了最后一架飞机，决定用它来找你们，即使知道风险很大。“当我们发现你们几乎没有带装备就进入了那个巨大洞穴时，我们认为你们可能需要救援。没想到我们的预料成真了。”他说。你告诉他，他们来的时机再好不过。\n"
"你们回到冰架的那一刻，肯斯勒博士就指示船员准备出发。你们甚至连屏障营地都没有来得及拆解。不过那都无关紧要。最重要的是你们能活著离开——当然还得带著你们找到的所有证据。\n"
"但是，你依然有未解的疑问。安全登上<b>菲奥多西亚号</b>后，你去找肯斯勒博士，询问她在那设施里做了什么。那个实体原本在追你，然后，突然间……“我告诉过你，那不是一个生物。”她解释道，“因此，它是杀不死的。至少用我们常规的手段是不行的。但它还是表现出了某种程度的知觉，对吧？它依然理解我们的欲望。我们的希望。我们的恐惧。”你提醒肯斯勒博士不该用“依然”。她紧咬牙齿。她周围的空气中出现了非常轻微的扭曲。“我……我做了个交易。”她小声说，“这是唯一的方法。"

"然后你听到了：头顶上飞机引擎的轰鸣。高田三架飞机中仅存的那架，正在城市上空盘旋，熟悉的喊声回荡在古老的破败街道上。“他们在那儿！在隧道旁边！快！”两辆雪橇滑进了视野，由伊里亚留在屏障营地里的其余随行犬拉著，载著几名<b>菲奥多西亚号</b>的船员。看到这一幕，你情不自禁地松了口气。他们疯狂地示意你上来，而他们的眼睛紧盯著正在渐渐渗出的恐怖瘴气。“那到底是什么鬼东西？”其中一人喊道。但没有时间解释了。你一登上雪橇，就命令他开始逃跑。\n"
"你对逃离城市的记忆疯狂而模糊。你依稀记得，你在积雪覆盖的古老街道上穿梭，躲避著石灰色的光滑建筑物周围蠕动的雾气，你在山间穿行时，勉强地避开了一团五彩斑斓的黏液。\n"
"那个生物消失于你们的视线外后，一名成员解释说，他们修好了最后一架飞机，决定用它来找你们，即使知道风险很大。“当我们发现你们几乎没有带装备就进入了那个巨大洞穴时，我们认为你们可能需要救援。没想到我们的预料成真了。”他说。\n"
"看到飞行员把最后一架飞机成功降落在山脉另一边，你松了一口气。你和救援人员到达后，带著剩下的随行犬一起立即匆忙登上飞机。在远处，你可以看到那个存在若隐若现，爬上参差不齐的山峰，直插云霄。\n"
"你丢下了雪橇和所有的补给。引擎轰鸣著启动，你们一起离开这疯狂的山脉。你不敢转过身去瞥一眼那几个月来一直困扰著丹佛斯的东西，但直到今天你仍然能听到它：回响著的尖叫声和无法言语的哭声，太过尖声刺耳而不自然的风，还有召唤你回去的低语。\n"
"从那灾难般的日子算起，已经过去很多年了。你还未把你的旅程的任何内容告诉科学界。然而，仍然没有那存在逃脱的任何迹象。它的活动范围是否局限于那片神秘的冰封大陆？还是说它只是在等待时机？\n"
"还是它已经在这里了，就在你呼吸的空气里？进入了你的思想？向你展示著虚假的现实？一个幻景？"
