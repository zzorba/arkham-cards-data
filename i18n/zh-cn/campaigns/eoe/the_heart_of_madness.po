msgid "Scenario IV: The Heart of Madness"
msgstr "冒险IV：疯狂之心"

msgid "The next day, you plumb deeper into the caverns and pits beneath the icy crust of Antarctica. You pass under great archways of obsidian and primordial slate, through ornately-carven corridors and enormous, many-pillared halls, down into unknowable and unfathomable depths."
msgstr "第二天，你深入到南极冰层下的洞穴和坑中。你穿过黑曜石和原始石板砌成的巨大拱门，穿过装饰华丽的走廊和有许多柱子的巨大大厅，进入未知的、深不可测的深渊。"

msgid "The team's leader pulls the group together for one last round of encouragement as you leave the relative safety of the surface behind. \"All right, everyone. I know these conditions are… not ideal,\" Dr. Kensler begins. \"But we are close. So very, very close. To getting answers. To making all of this effort, all of this madness worth something. Just a little further, and we will learn the truth.\" She sighs. \"This has been rough. On all of us. But please, bear with me a little while longer. I promise you, it will be worth it.\" Despite the otherwise grim mood, there is a murmuring of agreement among the survivors. You're not about to back down now."
msgstr "当你们离开相对安全的地表时，队长把队员们聚集在一起，给你们最后一轮鼓励。“好了，各位。我知道现在的情况并不理想。”肯斯勒博士开始说道，“但我们很接近了。非常、非常近。很快就能找到答案。让所有的努力，所有的疯狂都有意义。再往前走一点，我们就能知道真相了。”她叹了口气。“这很艰难。对我们所有人来说都是。但是，请再忍耐一会儿。我向你们保证，这是值得的。”尽管形势严峻，但幸存者之间还是达成了共识。现在不是你们打退堂鼓的时候。"

msgid "Step by step, you and the survivors trek further down the incline. The mood of your party is grim and hopeless. You feel as though there is no coming back from this place. You will likely meet your end here. The weight of this burdensome thought makes each of your steps heavy."
msgstr "你和其他幸存者一步一步地向下跋涉。你们团队的气氛严峻而绝望。你觉得好像再也回不去了。你的生命可能会在这里终结。这份沉重的心情让你举步维艰。"

msgid "<i>If the investigators scouted the forked passage:</i>"
msgstr "如果<i>调查员侦察了分岔通道</i>："

msgid "Eventually, you come to a familiar fork in the cavern, the same passage you and Ellsworth scouted the previous night. You explain to the others that you felt air circulating through the leftmost passage the previous night, and that it is therefore unlikely to be a dead end. The others give a nod of agreement, and together you venture into what you believe is the correct passage."
msgstr "最终，你来到了洞穴中熟悉的岔路口，就是你和埃尔斯沃思前一晚侦察过的那条路。你向其他人解释说，前一天晚上你感觉到最左边的通道里有空气回圈，因此不太可能是死路。其他人点头同意，然后你们一起深入你所认为的正确道路。"

msgid "After setup, before the next game begins, the lead investigator may look at the revealed side of any two Ancient Facility locations in play."
msgstr "冒险设置后，在接下来的游戏开始前，调查员队长可以查看场上任意两个古代设施地点的已揭示面。"

msgid "Eventually, you come to a fork in the cavern. To your left, the tunnel forks into a smaller, icy path with a steeper and more dangerous incline. To your right, the ramp simply continues onward without much change. With no other information to go off, you choose the larger of the two paths. It continues to fork along the way, taking you down a circuitous, lengthy route. You end up deeper within the caverns, though you're no longer sure how to get back…"
msgstr "最后，你来到了洞穴中的一个岔口。在你的左边，隧道分叉成一个更小的、结冰的道路和一个更陡峭更危险的斜坡。在你的右边，斜坡简单地向前延伸，没有太大的变化。在没有其他资讯的情况下，你选择两条路中较大的那条。它继续分叉，带你进入一个曲折而漫长的路线。你最终进入了洞穴的深处，尽管你已不知该如何返回……"

msgid "Hours pass. Eventually, the passage seems to open into a larger corridor of worked stone, with one final archway marking the end of the titanic ramp you have been descending. Five unfamiliar glyphs adorn the archway, their meaning incomprehensible. The path on the other side seems more like a vast underground subway tunnel than a natural cavern formation - all smooth, angular stone punctuated by alien markings and covered faintly in putrid, multicolored ichor."
msgstr "几个小时过去了。最后，这条通道似乎通向一个更大的石砌走廊，最后一个拱门标示著你正在下行的巨大坡道的尽头。拱门上装饰著五种陌生符号，它们的含义令人费解。另一边的路看起来更像一个巨大的地铁隧道，而不是一个天然的洞穴结构——所有光滑、棱角分明的石头上都点缀著异星标记，上面微微覆盖著腐败的、五彩缤纷的脓液。"

msgid "\"The creatures-they made this place,\" Danforth reasons as you pass beneath the final archway. \"It is just as I suspected the last time I was here. This is no natural part of Antarctica. It is all connected. This is the true heart of their civilization.\" You ask Danforth what he means—what did you explore yesterday, if not their city? \"It was but the tip of the iceberg, if you will pardon the expression,\" he states. \"Like the highest story of a skyscraper. But the ice and snow buried the rest. We could not tell.\" You ask how far down he believes the city descends. \"From what we saw of their history?\" He meets your gaze, sweat beading down his forehead. With all seriousness, he replies, \"to the very bottom of the ocean.\""
msgstr "“这些生物——它们创造了这个地方。”当你从最后的拱门下经过时，丹佛斯推断道，“正如我上次来这儿时所怀疑的那样。这不是南极的自然部分。都联系起来了。这才是他们文明的真正核心。”你问丹佛斯他的意思是什么——如果昨天那些不是它们的城市，那你们探索了什么？“请原谅我这么说，但这只是冰山一角。”他说，“就像摩天大楼的最高层。但是冰雪掩埋了剩下的部分。我们无法确认。”你问他认为这座城市会向下延伸多远。“就我们所看到的有关它们的历史来说？”他与你四目相望，汗珠顺著前额流下。他一本正经地回答说：“通到海底吧。”"

msgid "As you cross under the final archway, you begin to question the truth of this place. You thought it to be a natural cavern at first, but now it is clear the Elder Things—or some other primeval, alien force—had a hand in its design . Or are you going about this all wrong? Perhaps they are not the ones cast from afar, intruders upon your home. Perhaps Antarctica—indeed, the Earth—was never meant for you, or any of your kind. The truth of humanity's insignificance rattles you to your core."
msgstr "当你穿过最后的拱门时，你开始质疑这个地方的真实性。起初你以为这是一个天然的洞穴，但现在清楚了，古老者——或其他某种原始的异星力量——参与了它的设计。还是说你们理解的这一切都是错的？也许它们不是远方来客，不是你们家园的入侵者。也许南极——甚至是地球——从来就不是为你们，或者你们的同类准备的。人类渺小的真相使你震惊万分。"

msgid "Each investigator suffers 1 mental trauma."
msgstr "每位调查员受到1点精神创伤。"

msgid "If Miasmic Crystal is listed under \"Supplies Recovered\""
msgstr "如果“已回收的补给品”下有记录瘴气水晶："

msgid "Your backpack begins to glow once you enter this region of worked, carven stone. In a panic, you toss the pack off your shoulder and back away from it. Once a minute has passed without any change, you approach and carefully open it to reveal the strange otherworldly crystal you discovered shortly after the plane crash. It seems to be responding to this place, a bright glow and a droning hum emanating from within. It doesn't seem to be dangerous, so you tie the crystal around your waist and use its light to guide you onward."
msgstr "当你走进这个遍布精雕细琢过的石头的区域时，你的背包开始发光。在恐慌中，你把背包从肩上扔掉，并远离它。一分钟过去了，没有任何变化，你走近并小心地打开它，看到了你在飞机坠毁后不久发现的，奇怪又超凡脱俗的水晶。它似乎是在回应这个地方，明亮的光芒和低沉单调的嗡嗡声从内部散发出来。它看起来并不危险，所以你把水晶系在你的腰上，用它的光引导你前进。"

msgid "The darkness beyond is like the abyss at the bottom of the ocean. Your torches and lanterns reach only a few feet ahead before their light is swallowed by black. Coupled with the intense pressure and biting cold, you feel as though the weight of the entire world looms over you. It is a journey of unparalleled dread."
msgstr "远处的黑暗就像海底深渊。你的火把和提灯只能笼罩面前几英尺的地方，再远处它们的光就被黑暗吞没了。再加上巨大的压力和刺骨的寒冷，你觉得整个世界的重量都在逼近你。这是一次前所未有的恐惧之旅。"

msgid ""
"Finally, at the end of this vast chamber, you come to a nexus within the dormant structure: a scaled gateway of immense size, emblazoned with the same five glyphs, along with a series of interlocking mechanisms. Channels and grooves mark a path from the door's surface back to each of the five glyphs.\n"
"Beyond the gate, you hear a familiar churning, the bubbling and frothing of miasma, and the seething of hateful mist. \"It is beyond this door,\" one of your party says, and you cannot help but agree. You can feel its presence or rather, you have felt its presence all along, ever since you set foot on Antarctica, only now its call is impossible to ignore. It whispers faintly to you. Along the surface of your mind, visions play out. Your wildest dreams and most joyful moments. Your darkest desires and hardest struggles. It is a mirage. The mirage. Sealed behind this door, likely for eons upon end, watched over, or perhaps even harnessed, by those who came before you. But it is escaping, bit by bit. The creatures you have encountered and fought are evidence enough of that. The Elder Things know it is breaking free, too. They built this place, and now it is abandoned…"

"最后，在这个巨大房间的尽头，你来到了休眠建筑中的一个连接点：一个巨大的密封大门，上面装饰著同样的五个符号，还有一系列联动机制。通道和凹槽标示出从门的表层连通到每一个符号的路径。\n"
"在大门之外，你可以听到熟悉的翻腾声，瘴气冒泡声，以及可怕烟雾的沸腾声。“就在这扇门后面。”团队内的一人说，你不禁表示同意。你能感觉到它的存在——或者更确切地说，从你踏上南极开始，你就一直感觉到它的存在，只是现在你已无法忽视它的召唤。它轻声对你低语著。在你内心汪洋的海面处，幻觉开始浮现。你最狂野的梦境，你最快乐的时刻。你最黑暗的欲望，你最艰难的挣扎。它是幻景。幻景是它。封印于这扇门后，数不清的岁月，被你之前的存在守望著，甚至可能被套上过缰绳。但它正在渐渐地，逃离此处。你遇到并战斗过的生物就足以证明这一点。古老者也知道它正在挣脱。他们建了这个地方，现在却废弃了……"

msgid "<i>Stay here and study the great door to learn more.</i>"
msgstr "<i>留在这里研究大门，以了解更多。</i>"

msgid "You will play both parts of the scenario."
