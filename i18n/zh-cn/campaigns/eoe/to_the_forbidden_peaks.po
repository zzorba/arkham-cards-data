"The wind howls as your party prepares for the long journey ahead. There is very little conversation. Even if you could hear each other's muffled voices through your earmuffs and scarves, what would you say? The silence of your shared terror is loud enough.\n"
"Your destination is many miles ahead of you. The jagged peaks loom far on the horizon, taunting you. You run a mental checklist of your situation…"
msgstr ""
"当你的队伍准备远行时，狂风呼啸。队伍中几乎没有交谈声。即使你能透过耳套和围巾听到其他人低沉的声音，你会有什么想说的吗？你们共同恐惧的沉默已经够响亮了。\n"
"你的目的地在前方数英里开外。锯齿状山峰隐约显现在远方的地平线上，奚落著你。你在心里对自己的处境列了一个清单……"

msgid "Check your Campaign Log and read each passage below that corresponds to your situation."
msgstr "检查剧本日志，阅读下面每一段与你处境对应的段落。"

msgid "If Eliyah Ashevak is alive and Wooden Sledge is listed under \"Supplies Recovered:\""
msgstr "如果伊里亚·阿什瓦克活著，且“已回收的补给品”下记录著木制雪橇："

msgid "\"It is not large or sturdy enough to carry all of us,\" Eliyah explains as he hauls the last crate of supplies onto the old sledge, \"but it should be able to carry our provisions and equipment, at least.\" He makes sure the lines are taut and all of the dogs' harnesses are properly fastened before giving Anyu, at the head of the pack, a scratch behind her ears. \"Not looking forward to having to lug this thing up those mountains, but… we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. All right, girl. You ready?\" Anyu barks once. \"Yeah, I know you are.\""
msgstr "“它不够大，也不够结实，装不下我们所有人。”伊里亚一边把最后一箱补给品拖到旧雪橇上，一边解释说，“但至少应该能装得下我们的预备品和装备。”他确认了绳子已经拉紧，所有随行犬的挽具都正确固定好了，然后理了理领头的安雨的耳朵后面。“别指望著能把这东西拖上山，但是……船到桥头自然直。那么，小姑娘。准备好了吗？”安雨叫了一声。“很好，我就知道。”"

msgid "You groan as you heft an enormous, heavy backpack full of equipment onto your back. You're definitely not looking forward to trekking across the snow with an extra forty pounds, but there's no avoiding it. You have no idea how long you're going to be where you're headed, and you'll need everything in that backpack if you want to survive."
msgstr "你呻吟著把一个装满装备又大又重的背包扛到背上。你肯定不想带著额外的40磅重量徒步穿越雪地，但这已无法避免。你不知道要花多久才能到你要去的地方，而如果你想活下去，背包里的一切都是必需的。"

msgid "\"Weather might look clear right now,\" Claypool explains, \"but it could turn on a dime. We'll be on ice for most of the journey, so be on the lookout for cracks. We need ice about 60 centimeters thick in order to walk across, so stay behind me at all times and I'll use this augur to make sure it's safe.\" He holds up a spiral-tipped drilling device and leads the way."
msgstr "克莱普尔解释说：“现在天气可能看起来很晴朗，但它可能在瞬间转变。我们大部分时间都在冰上，所以要注意裂缝。我们需要60公分厚的冰才能走过去，所以要一直跟在我后面，我会用这个来确保安全。”他手持一个螺旋形的钻孔装置，一马当先。"

msgid "You venture out when the sky looks clear, but it only takes an hour for the weather to take a sudden turn for the worse. The heavy snowfall is bad enough, but it's the ice that truly slows you down. Without Claypool to safely guide you, you have to proceed slowly and cautiously to ensure you even make it to the mountains alive."
msgstr "当天空看起来很晴朗的时候，你冒险外出，但只过了一个小时，天气就突然变坏了。大雪已经够糟糕的了，但真正让你慢下来的是冰。没有克莱普尔的安全指引，你必须缓慢小心地前进以确保你能活著到达山脉。"

"As you set out, you hear Takada singing something under her breath—just quiet enough that you can't tell what it is. One of the others, however, seems to recognize it. \"That song again,\" they say. \"Heard you singing it on the Theodosia on the way over.\"\n"
"Takada sighs. \"It is a song my father taught me. Helps me pass the time,\" she explains.\n"
"You ask if she would like to teach it to you, and she gives you the first smile you've seen from her since the trek began: \"Yes. Yes, I would.\" You spend the remainder of the journey singing and bonding together; whittling the time away."

"当你出发的时候，你听到高田低声唱著什么——声音小到你听不出那是什么。然而，有其他人似乎认出来了。“又是那首歌。”那人说。“来的路上听到你在菲奥多西亚号上唱的。”\n"
"高田叹了一口气。“这是我父亲教我的一首歌。它能帮我打发时间。”她解释道。\n"
"你问她是否愿意教你，她回你一个微笑，这是徒步旅行以来你第一次看到她笑。“行。来吧，我来教你。”在剩下的旅途中，你们一起唱歌、聚在一起，消磨时间。"

msgid "The party suffers through the cold in unbearable silence. Each footstep is as lonely as it is harrowing."
msgstr "队伍在难以忍受的寂静中忍受著寒冷前进。每一步都是孤独的，也是痛苦的。"

msgid "<i>If the investigators scouted the mountain pass:</i>"
msgstr "<i>如果调查员对山口进行了侦察：</i>"

msgid "You seek out the safe pass that you and Ellsworth scouted last night, guiding the rest of the team onward. Sheer cliffs flank you as you approach the foothills, blocking the chill wind. The shortcut gives you swift passage as you begin your trek up to the peaks…"
msgstr "你找出昨晚你和埃尔斯沃思侦察时发现的那条安全通道，引导其他队员过去。当你接近山麓时，陡峭的悬崖挡住了寒风。你开始向山顶攀登，这条捷径让你们进展迅速……"

msgid "During setup, when you reveal the starting location, reduce its clue value by half (rounded up)."
msgstr "冒险设置期间，在你揭示起始地点时，使其线索值减半(向上取整)。"

msgid "The frozen tundra leading up to the foothills of the jagged mountains is hard terrain to traverse. Even prepared as you are with snowshoes and warm clothes to fight the cold, the going is slow and rough. The wind fights you at every turn, its gusts strong enough to knock you over. But you continue onward, undeterred."
msgstr "通向锯齿状山脉的丘陵冻土带是很难穿越的地形。即使你已经准备好了雪地鞋和保暖的衣服来御寒，行路仍然缓慢而艰难。狂风在每一个拐角都与你搏斗，强到足以把你吹倒。但是你依然继续前进，毫不动摇。"

"You hike through the ice and snow for many grueling hours. Luckily, you encounter no more of the creatures from the previous two days, leaving you to ponder if it was all some cruel mirage. But as you draw closer to the base of the jagged snow-tipped mountains, you find another manner of creature altogether.\n"
"It lies frozen and half-buried in the snow, like a macabre waymarker guiding you onward. Its body is shaped like a drum, with thick hide and a pair of torn, leathery wings. A starfish-shaped appendage sticks out of the snow from its top half, adorned with five dead eyes and a set of prismatic cilia. Five sets of tentacles lie frozen in the ice. The sight of the thing chills you more than the Antarctic weather possibly could.\n"
"There can be no doubt: this is one of the \"Elder Things\" that Professor Dyer and Danforth encountered the last time they ventured into the heart of Antarctica. But what killed it? Surely it was not just the cold?"
msgstr ""
"你在冰雪中跋涉了好几个小时。幸运的是，你没有再遇到前两天的生物，这让你思考那是否只是某种残酷的幻景。但当你走近锯齿状雪山的底部时，你发现了另一种完全不同的生物。\n"
"它被冻结著半埋在雪里，像一个令人毛骨悚然的路标指引著你前进。它的身体形状像鼓，有厚厚的皮和一对撕裂的皮翼。一个海星形状的附属器官从它的上半部分伸出雪中，长有五只死眼和一组五颜六色的纤毛。五组触须则都冻在冰里。看到这东西，你感受到的寒意比南极的天气更冷。\n"
"毫无疑问，这是戴尔教授和丹佛斯上次深入南极中心地带时遇到的“古老者”之一。但是什么杀了它呢？肯定不仅仅是因为寒冷吧？"

msgid "Shuffle the seven Mountainside locactions and put five of them into play in a diagonal line. Set the remaining two locations aside, out of play. Put The Summit location into play at the top of the diagonal line. The position of each location has its own level from 0-5, beginning at the bottommost location at level 0 and ascending to The Summit at level 5."

msgid "If the victim is James \"Cookie\" Fredericks:"
msgstr "如果受害者是詹姆斯·“曲奇”·弗雷德里克斯："

msgid "The hardened veteran spits out a curse and manages to slip his right arm out of the thing's grasp. It's enough for him to take a single shot with his colt. The gunshot thunders across the mountain and rips through the thing's grotesque, formless mass."
msgstr "身经百战的老兵咒骂了一句，设法将右臂从那东西的抓攫中松开。这足以让他用他的柯尔特开一枪。枪声响彻山脉，那团奇怪无形的东西上被打穿了一个开口。"

msgid "Then, without a moment of consideration, it shoves its tendrils into its victim's body and yanks them apart like a piece of uncooked meat. A spray of blood stains the snow crimson. It drops what remains of your companion unceremoniously onto the ground and turns its attention to you."
msgstr "然后，它毫不犹豫地把卷须插进受害者的身体，把后者就像一块生肉似的当场撕碎。喷出的血把雪染成了红色。它毫不客气地把你同伴的残骸扔到地上，然后把注意力转向你。"

"The view from the summit is breathtaking, but you are in no mood to enjoy the spectacle. Sprawled before you, on the other side of these accursed peaks, lies the city described in Dyer's report. Its haunting visage is unmistakable. Dozens of conical and pyramidal buildings of dark slate and sandstone are honeycombed throughout the region like a labyrinth of perfect geometric shapes. Though weathered by the ages, the city still stands, hidden by the jagged peaks and the heavy snow.\n"

"山顶处的景色叹为观止，但你无心享受。在你面前，这些被诅咒的山峰彼端，是戴尔报告中描述的城市。它那令人难忘的样子毋庸置疑。几十座由黑色石板和砂岩建造的圆锥形和金字塔形建筑像蜂巢一样遍布整个地区，就像一个完美的几何形状的迷宫。尽管历经岁月的沧桑，这座城市依然屹立不倒，隐藏在锯齿状山峰和大雪之中。\n"
"有那么一会儿，你静静地站在那里，欣赏这奇妙的景象。如果不是因为一路上的诸多艰险，此刻本应是欢庆胜利之时。但在付出了这么多牺牲之后，胜利尝起来甚是空洞无味。\n"
"刺骨寒风吹过山峰。空气太稀薄了，你不能在这里过多逗留。休息片刻后，你开始长途跋涉，进入陌生的城市。在到达山脚下之前，你必须扎营。运气好的话，住在那里的可怕生物不会注意到你……"

"Just as you are beginning to lose hope, you find a dark cave embedded in the mountainside. The wind howls outside the cave entrance, bringing with it a sudden deluge of snow. You're not sure what would be worse—a slow death trapped inside an icy cavern, or an equally slow one failing to reach the summit. But when one of your companions switches on their flashlight, you realize there may be a third option.\n"
"The walls of this narrow tunnel are covered in strange hieroglyphs, the likes of which you've never seen. The ancient writings of an alien language, you presume. Possibly even that of the Elder Things who once called this region home. More importantly, the cavern continues deeper and deeper into the side of the mountain, far beyond the reach of your light.\n"
"You take a vote and decide to press onward, hoping beyond hope that the tunnel might take you to another exit. To your surprise, the journey is smooth, although the ever-present darkness, the frightening echoes of uncanny groans, and the muffled voices of something deep below wear upon your sanity. For hours you continue on, until finally, mercifully, you see light in the distance.\n"
"You emerge once more onto the side of the mountain, this time to a breathtaking vista. Sprawled before you lies the city described in Dyer's report. Its haunting visage is unmistakable. Dozens of conical and pyramidal buildings of dark slate and sandstone are honeycombed throughout the region like a labyrinth of perfect geometric shapes. Though weathered by the ages, the city still stands, hidden by the jagged peaks and the heavy snow.\n"
"For a while, you stand in silence and take in the wondrous sight. Somehow, you have managed to find a way through the mountain. If it weren't for the many trials you faced along the way, it would be a moment of triumph. But after the sacrifices made to get here, the victory rings hollow. After a moment's rest, you begin the long trek down into the alien city. You will have to make camp before you reach the bottom. With any luck, you'll be hidden from the dreadful creatures that dwell there…"

"正当你开始失去希望时，你在半山腰发现一座黑暗的洞穴。洞口外狂风呼啸，一场大雪突然接踵而至。你不知道哪种情况更糟——被困在冰冷洞穴里慢慢死去，还是在到达顶峰前同样缓慢地死去。但当你的一个同伴打开手电筒时，你意识到可能还有第三种选择。\n"
"这条狭窄隧道的墙壁上布满了你从未见过的奇怪的象形文字。你认为这是用异星语言所写的古代作品。甚至可能就是那些曾经在这片地方安家的古老者写的。更重要的是，洞穴通向山峰内侧越来越深的地方，远远超出了你的光线所能照射到的范围。\n"
"你们投票后决定继续前进，希望隧道能把你带到另一个出口。令你惊讶的是，旅程相当顺利，除了始终存在著的黑暗，还有可怕呻吟的回声和下面深处什么东西那低沉的声音在不停磨损著你的理智。几个小时过去了，直到最后，非常幸运，你看到远处有光。\n"
"你再次出现在山的一侧，这一次是令人惊叹的景色。在你面前的是戴尔报告中描述的城市。它那令人难忘的样子毋庸置疑。几十座由黑色石板和砂岩建造的圆锥形和金字塔形建筑像蜂巢一样遍布整个地区，就像一个完美的几何形状的迷宫。尽管历经岁月的沧桑，这座城市依然屹立不倒，隐藏在锯齿状山峰和大雪之中。\n"
