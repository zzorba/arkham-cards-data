"It has been a long eight weeks since you left Boston, and not without its toil. The Theodosia followed much the same route as its predecessors, the Arkham and the Miskatonic—first sailing southward along the east coast and through the Panama Canal, before venturing toward the Antarctic Circle. As the weather grew steadily colder, icebergs became more and more of a problem for the ship to navigate, but with the crew's expertise and the logs of the previous captains who made this same journey, you make good time. Soon enough, you spy the mist-covered peaks of Mts. Erebus and Terror ahead, marking the site of Ross Island, near the ice shelf that will serve as the expedition's landing spot.\n"
"As you approach the coast, Dr. Kensler and the rest of the team meet aboard the deck of the Theodosia to discuss your plans. \"We'll use the same breeches-buoy system as before to unload supplies onto the ice shelf,\" she explains. \"Mr. Fredericks, Mr. Ellsworth, and Mr. Claypool, you'll be taking one of our smaller boats to the shelf to find us a landing zone. Ms. Takada, once we have a camp up and running, those aeroplanes are your first priority. Mr. Ashevak, I expect those sledges to help move supplies from the landing to camp. As soon as we reach the ice shelf, there's going to be a lot of work to get done in a short time. I don't want you to have to wrangle three dozen dogs on top of all that. So get them in order.\"\n"
"Eliyah rolls his eyes and idly pets Anyu, who sits diligently by his side. \"Yes ma'am.\"\n"
"Professor Dyer speaks up. \"I suspect the lack of ice-melting and boring equipment means we aren't taking any mineral samples?\" he asks rhetorically.\n"
"Dr. Kensler shakes her head. \"No need, although if we happen to find a suitable piece, we might as well claim it. That said, our mission is solely to corroborate the findings you made with Danforth, and to bring back more evidence of this ancient species, these 'Elder Things,' as you dubbed them. A living specimen would be ideal, of course… such a strange and alien beast, trapped in ice throughout the ages—it would be like discovering a live woolly mammoth, I imagine.\"\n"
"He balks at that. \"A living specimen? You do know these things killed several of Lake's men, right? And how do you propose we capture one, exactly?\"\n"
"She blinks. \"You're the expert, William. You tell me.\"\n"
"Dyer walks off, shaking his head and muttering angrily. \"I knew this was a bad idea…\"\n"
"\"All right, you all have your assignments. We will reach land within the hour. Be ready,\" Dr. Kensler says, dismissing the meeting. Before she can go below deck, you approach and remark that you aren't sure what you should be doing just yet.\n"
"\"Oh, there will be enough manual labor to go around,\" she replies with the hint of a smirk."

"自从离开波士顿，已经过了漫长的八周，同时也不乏一路上的劳顿。菲奥多西亚号基本遵循了它的前辈，阿卡姆号与米斯卡塔尼克号的路线——首先沿著东海岸向南航行，穿过巴拿马运河，然后向南极圈进发。随著天气持续变冷，冰山对航行的阻挠越来越大，但根据船员的专业知识，以及之前进行过同样旅程的船长的记录，你们顺风顺水。很快，你就在前方发现了迷雾笼罩的埃里伯斯火山和特罗尔山，标示著那里是罗斯岛，距离探险队的登陆点所在的冰架已经不远了。\n"
"当你们接近海岸时，肯斯勒博士和其他队员在菲奥多西亚号的甲板上聚集，讨论著计画。“我们会使用与之前一样的双筒救生圈系统，将物资卸到冰架上。”她解释道，“弗雷德里克斯先生、埃尔斯沃思先生，以及克莱普尔先生，你们要用我们的一艘小船到达冰架那，为我们寻找一个登陆区域。高田女士，一旦我们建起营地并开始运作，飞机就是你的首要任务。阿什瓦克先生，我希望这些雪橇能帮助我们将补给从登陆点运到营地。我们一到达冰架，在短时间内就会有很多工作要做。我可不希望你再和三十几条狗纠缠在一起。请控制好它们。”\n"
"伊里亚翻了个白眼，漫不经心地抚弄著坐在他身边的安雨。“是的，长官。”\n"
"戴尔教授此时发言：“我们缺少融冰设备和钻孔设备，是不是说明我们不打算采集任何矿物样本？”他委婉地问道。\n"
"肯斯勒博士摇头。“不需要，不过如果我们正好碰到合适的碎片，我们也可以顺便采集。也就是说，我们的任务仅仅是要证实你和丹佛斯的发现，带回更多关于这个古老物种的证据，也就是你口中的“古老者”。当然，最好能得到活生生的样本……如此古怪、奇异的生物，被困于冰中直至今日——我想，这就像发现一只活的长毛象一样。 ”\n"
"他听到这话畏缩了一下。“活的样本？你应该知道这种东西杀了多少莱克的人吧？而且你具体打算怎么活捉一只？”\n"
"她眨了眨眼睛。“威廉，你才是专家。你来想办法吧。”\n"
"戴尔摇摇头，愤愤地嘟囔著走开了。“我就知道这是个坏主意……”\n"
"“好了，你们现在都安排好了。我们将在一小时内到达陆地。都准备好。”肯斯勒博士说完，结束了会议。在她走下甲板之前，你靠近她，表示你还不知道你该做什么。\n"
"“噢，有的是苦力活等著你。”她回答道，露出一丝得意的笑容。"
