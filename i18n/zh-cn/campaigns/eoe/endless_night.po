msgstr "幕间故事II：无尽夜晚"

msgid "Once again safe, you and your companions set up camp in silence. You marvel at how much quieter the evening is compared to those that came before, be it due to your dwindling numbers or the grim mood that hangs over the camp. But the quiet is anything but peaceful. As the hours pass, you can't seem to get any rest. You decide instead to check on your companions…"
msgstr "再一次安全了，你和你的同伴沉默地搭建营地。你惊奇地发现，与之前相比，今夜安静多了，这可能是由于你们人数的减少，也可能是由于笼罩在营地上空的阴郁情绪。但这里的安静绝不代表和平。随著时间的流逝，你似乎得不到任何休息。你决定去看看你的同伴……"

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team found another way through the mountains</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."
msgstr "你只有一点时间去查看几名队员(无论他们是活著还是被划掉)。每次选择以下一个部分阅读，一共三次(如果<i>队伍找到另一条路穿过山脉</i>，改为四次)。如果所选择的部分的游戏效果不能执 行，则这次选择不计数，你可以改为再选择一个新的部分。"

msgid "If William Dyer is alive:"
msgstr "如果威廉·戴尔活著："

msgid "The professor paces back and forth, running his fingers through his graying hair. “They are connected. They must be connected,” he rambles to himself as you approach. “The Elder Things and these manifestations, these ‘mirages’,” he continues, as if to answer your unspoken question. “When we were here last, I saw images of the Elder Things in conflict with other species, other… alien beings. But what if the true source of their fear lies here on Earth?” His gaze meets yours. “What if this wasn't their true home? What if… what if they were guarding something?”"
msgstr "教授来回踱步，用手指梳理著他灰白的头发。“它们是有联系的。它们一定是有联系的。”你走近时，他正在自言自语，“古老者和这些显现，这些‘幻景’。”他继续说著，好像在回答你没有问出口的问题。“我们上次到这儿的时候，我看到了古老者与其他种族，其他……异形生物发生冲突的画面。但如果它们恐惧的真正源头就在地球上呢？”他凝视著你的眼睛。“如果这儿不是它们真正的家园呢？如果……如果它们是在看守什么东西呢？”"

msgstr "与戴尔教授交谈使你窥见这疯狂中的理性。任意一位调查员可以选择并移除其牌组中最多5张忒咳哩-哩！弱点<i>(将它们与忒咳哩-哩遭遇组中的剩余卡牌混洗在一起)</i>。"

msgstr "因为没有调查员的牌组中有忒咳哩-哩！弱点，你可以选择阅读一个额外的对话。"

msgid "You take a moment to pore through some of the professor’s old sketches, which he brought with him in the event they might prove useful. As you suspected, none of the creatures he depicted look anything like the things you saw. But just as you are about to give up, you find several sketches of the city he claims to have found beyond the dark, jagged mountains. These depict an enormous archway emblazoned with five glyphs surrounded by a five-pointed star. Below the archway—or perhaps behind it—looms something grotesque. The lines of the sketch disintegrate into a tangle of light strokes and splotches of ink you can scarcely describe. Several more creatures with barrel-shaped bodies and starfish-like heads—the alien “Elder Things” Dyer described in his report—flank the archway, looking on reverently, their wing-like appendages spread forth in reverence. You wish you could ask Dyer himself what this may mean, but sadly, it’s too late for that. You collect his sketches and bring them with you, hoping they might come in handy later."
msgstr "你花了点时间仔细研究了教授以前画的一些素描，他把这些素描都带著，以防万一会用到。正如你所猜想的，他所描绘的生物和你见到的东西没有任何相似之处。但就在你准备放弃的时候，你发现了几张他声称在锯齿状的黑色山脉后面发现的城市的草图。这些图描绘了一个巨大的拱门，上面装饰著五个象形文字，围绕著一个五角星。拱门下面——或者拱门后面——隐现著一些怪诞的东西。素描的线条化成一团乱麻的笔触和难以形容的墨渍。而更多有著桶形身体和海星状头部的生物——戴尔在他的报告中描述的外星人“古老者”——站在拱门侧面，虔诚地看著，它们翅膀一样的附属肢体伸展开来以示尊敬。你很希望你还能够向戴尔询问这意味著什么，但遗憾的是已经太迟了。你收集了他的素描并随身携带，希望以后能派上用场。"

msgid "Nobody else seems to understand Danforth’s ramblings, but you think you're starting to. Or, at the very least, you're the only one trying. After all, whatever he saw during the last journey here, it lies at the heart of all of this. “It was… it…” he pauses, his voice hitching as he tries to explain. “It was like the creatures we’ve seen. Ink, mist, and color. Or, at least, I think that the only way our human eyes might interpret their true shape.” His own eyes are distant, glazed over with horror as he reimagines the mirage. “It is still here. Bound, shackled. But not for long, I fear. Not for long.”"
msgstr "似乎没人理解丹佛斯的胡言乱语，但你觉得你开始明白了。或者至少，你是唯一一个在努力的人。毕竟，无论他在上次旅程中看到了什么，那都是这一切的核心。“它是……它……”他停顿了，试图解释但声音哽咽。“它就像我们见到过的那种生物。墨色、雾状，还五彩缤纷。或者至少，我认为，这是我们人类的眼睛能够了解它们真实形状的唯一办法。”当他回想那幻景时，他的眼神由于恐惧，显得空洞而遥远。“它还在这里。被约束、束缚著。但我恐怕已经不会太久了。不会太久了。”"

msgid "Listening to Danforth gives you further insight into the madness of this place. Any one investigator may begin <b>Scenario III: City of the Elder Things</b> with two additional cards drawn in their opening hand."
msgstr "听丹佛斯的一番话使你更深入洞悉了此地的疯狂。任意一位调查员可以在开始<b>冒险III：古老者之城</b>的时候额外有两张起始手牌。"

msgid "You decide to seek wisdom in Danforth’s belongings, hoping he kept a journal or some evidence from his prior expedition with Dyer. What you find instead is a treasure trove of fiction both macabre and speculative, including a well-worn copy of the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Its pages are punctuated by many makeshift tabs, and its margins inscribed with many notes and jottings—some relevant, others whose true meaning eludes you. You’re not sure why Danforth thought there was any reason to bring such a collection of tales, most especially one so beloved to him. You open it to one of the tabbed pages and read: “He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ‘Tekeli-li!’” In the margins, Danforth has scribbled: “What could force one out of such paroxysm? How can I leave this dreadful feeling behind?”"
msgstr "你决定从丹佛斯的遗物中寻找智慧，希望他有日记或者一些他之前和戴尔一起探险的证据。但你发现的却是一个既可怕又稀奇古怪的小说宝库。其中包括一本老旧的爱德格·爱伦·坡作品集。它的书页上有许多临时的标签，页边写著许多笔记——有些是相关的，有些是你无法理解其真正含义的。你不清楚为什么丹佛斯认为他有理由把这么多小说带著，特别是他这么喜欢的一本。你打开到一个标签页，读道：“我们无法说服他去触摸它或接近它，而当我们试图强迫他时，他开始颤抖，并尖叫著‘忒咳哩-哩！’。”在书的空白处，丹佛斯草草写下：“是什么能使一个人突然这样爆走呢？我该怎样才能把这种可怕的感觉抛在脑后呢？”"

msgstr "如果艾米·肯斯勒博士活著，但在剧本日志中并未记录著<i>肯斯勒博士与你分享她的研究</i>："

msgid "Dr. Kensler is unsurprised when you enter her tent. She looks up from her desk and tilts her glasses down to gaze at you directly. “Here to inquire after my findings?” she asks, to which you nod. “Very well.” You note her unusually warm demeanor as you approach and peer over her shoulder. In front of her, a section of one of an Elder Thing's limbs is dissected with expert precision. Dark green liquid stains its scaly flesh and the surface beneath it alike. She raises her glasses once again and turns to face her anatomical sample. “It's not unlike us,” she says, “just as Dyer suggested in his own account. And yet, somehow, they are able to survive incredible pressure and cold. Perhaps even the vacuum of space. What I don't understand is …” she breathes deep, and continues. “Dyer's report only accounts for the waking of a few of these creatures from their hibernation. Why, then, are so many of them active?”"
msgstr "当你进入肯斯勒博士的帐篷时，她并不惊讶。她从桌子上抬起头来，拿下眼镜直视著你。“来打听我的发现吗？”她问道，你点点头。“好吧。”当你走近她，越过肩膀看向她后方时，你注意到她异常热情。在她面前，一个古老者肢体的一部分被精确解剖了。深绿色的液体污染了它鳞片状的皮肤与下方的表面。她再次抬起眼镜，转向她的解剖样本。“它和我们没什么不同。”她说，“正如戴尔在他自己的描述中提出的。然而，不知为何，它们能够在难以置信的压力和寒冷中生存。甚至宇宙真空环境中也可能存活。我不明白的是……”她深深吸了口气，继续说，戴尔的报告提到这些生物只有一部分从冬眠中苏醒。那么，为何现在却有如此多的活跃数量？”"

"You survey the research notes left behind by the leader of this doomed expedition. Surely, if anyone could make some sense out of what you’ve seen so far, it would be Dr. Kensler. Perhaps she knew more about these creatures than she let on. You scour her tent and filter through her belongings until you come across a thick journal filled with meticulous notes regarding the journey to Antarctica and the first couple days you spent unloading supplies and setting up camp. From there, the notes become less detailed and more jumbled. Her recounting of the days leading up to the plane crash is less a well-kept diary and more a delirious tangent. She wrote of walls dripping with black miasma, an endless void beneath the ice, something evil and alien that dwelled at the core beyond the gateway—and then, nothing.\n"
"Dr. Kensler had not been one to recount dreams or author works of fiction. Something had rattled her. Something had made her see the things of which she wrote. But how? And when? You sit and continue her documentation with your own record of events, hoping grimly that if you don’t make it off this continent alive, someone will read this and know what transpired here…"

"肯斯勒博士不是那种会讲述梦境或虚构小说的人。有什么东西让她惊慌失措。有什么东西让她看到了她写下的东西。但是是怎么做到的？还有在什么时候？你坐了下来，在她的记录后继续记录你自己的遭遇，希望如果你不能活著离开这片大陆的话，有人会读到这些，从而知道这里到底发生了什么……"

You had come to her expecting a roll of her eyes and a scolding over your condition. “Oh, come on. I'm not allowed to worry? After everything we've seen and been through, I think I'm overdue a bit of fretting.” At her insistance, you allow her to examine you for wounds and early signs of hypothermia. “We're lucky to still be alive you know,” she says quietly as she unpacks her medical kit. “Or maybe…” she clicks her teeth, and shakes her head. “…maybe they're the lucky ones.”"

Still, perhaps you can salvage some use out of her old medical kits and cold-weather gear. As you stuff her medical supplies into one of her backpacks, a shiver crawls up your back. You tell yourself it is out of necessity, but helping yourself to the belongings of the dead still weighs heavily on your conscience. You heft the backpack straps onto your shoulders and turn to leave Dr. Sinha’s tent, hoping to put this grim business out of mind. The quiet clatter of something falling out of the backpack’s front pocket catches your attention. You search around your feet for the object and find a small leather wallet containing only a hairpin, a picture of Dr. Sinha with what you can only assume to be her family, and a ticket stub for a show at the Riverview Theatre. Without truly thinking why, you pocket it. If it was important enough for her to keep, it must hold some sentiment."

The remains of the campfire smolder silently between the two of you, dim light casting a dancing shadow behind his hunched figure. “Hope yer not here for advice,” he mutters at long last. You shake your head and inform him that you're just here for the companionship. “Sure, sure. Can't sleep, more like,” he accuses. You say nothing in response. You cannot refute the truth. He takes a long, hard breath, then goes on. “When we were in the trenches, we almost never slept. It was hard enough in those conditions, in the dirt and mud, covered in flies. And anytime we tried, the Germans would wake us up with mortar fire. The exhaustion was unbearable.” His stare burns into the fire. “Even an hour or two was a godsend. But I got through that hell, somehow, despite everything tryin' to kill me.” You ask him how you're supposed to do the same. Cookie's lips turn downward, but the question doesn't deter him. “All right, then. Listen up.”"

You sit by the campfire and examine the items in the satchel one by one. Inside are several of Cookie’s personal effects—a pocketwatch with a cracked face, a matchbook emblazoned with the logo of the Excelsior Hotel, and of course his trusty .32 Colt revolver. It is exceptionally well-maintained, its barrel polished clean and its wooden grip immaculate. Knowing Cookie, it had less to do with his love of the thing and more to do with old habits dying hard.

They chose precisely the right place to build their city. And the way these structures and streets are built, they're mostly protected from excess snowfall.” He glances at you meaningfully before continuing. “These creatures chose the harshest place on Earth to make their home, and despite all odds, they thrived.” You wonder if perhaps this means the inclement weather you've faced thus far will abate during the next leg of your journey. “Unlikey,” he responds. “A lot of the natural safeguards they built into their city seem to have weathered away. And there's likely a lot more ice than there would have been back in their time. But I'll make sure we avoid the nastiest of it.”"

"“艾弗里，你……”埃尔斯沃思露出一丝微笑，“你在担心我吗？”\n"
"克莱普尔扔下背包，翻了个白眼。“怎么，不行啊？”两人重新和好，你暗自发笑，然后偷偷溜走了。"

msgid "If you didn’t know any better, you’d assume Ellsworth had been preparing for the apocalypse. Despite his reputation as a light‑footed explorer and expert backpacker, a cursory glance at the belongings he left behind provides a wealth of provisions, supplies, and cold-weather gear. As the team mournfully divides his things so as to put them to good use, you spot an extra pair of water-resistant boots he must have brought along as backup. You don’t know if any of you could truly follow in his footsteps, but at least with these you might be able to walk in his shoes."
msgstr "如果你不了解情况，你会以为埃尔斯沃思是在为世界末日做准备。尽管他是一个脚步轻盈的探险者和专业的背包客，但只要粗略地看一眼他留下的物品，就能发现大量的预备品、补给和应对寒冷天气的装备。当团队成员悲痛不舍地把他的东西分门别类摆好，以便以后用得著的时候，你发现了额外一双防水靴子，一定是他带著备用的。你们不知道你们中是否有人能真正追随他的脚步，但至少有了这东西，你们可以用他的鞋来前行。"

msgid "The team's interim quartermaster is in the middle of counting something when you accost her. She curses as she loses count. “Do you have any idea how long it took me to-” she stops and rolls her eyes. Her next question is drilled in exasperated monotone. “What do you want?” You inform Tadaka that you would like to requisition some supplies for tomorrow's journey into the alien city. “Oh you would, would you?” She sighs. “Yeah, that is fine. But do not take anything in that pack.” She motions to a backpack brimming with spare aeroplane parts and provisions. “It is… a long story,” she answers your unspoken question, and that's the end of that discussion."
msgstr "你跟队伍的临时军需官搭话时，她正在清点东西。她忘了数到哪儿了，咒骂著：“你知不知道我花了多久才——”她停了下来，翻了个白眼。她恼怒地一字一顿问道：“你想干嘛？”你告知高田，你想为明天去异星生物城市的行程申请一些补给。“喔，你打算去？”她叹了口气。“好吧，那行。但是不要动那个包里的东西。”她指著一个装满飞机零件和预备品的背包。“这……说来话长。”她回答了你没说出口的问题，谈话到此结束。"

msgid "For somebody who supposedly took pride in her organizational skills, Takada’s mechanical supplies are an absolute mess. If you didn’t know any better, you would think there was no rhyme or reason whatsoever to how she stored her things—but with Takada, you suspect that she had a system of some kind. You spend several minutes poring through her belongings in search of anything that might be of value to the remaining members of the expedition. Without Takada, you won’t be able to put the final aeroplane in flying shape. In fact, you imagine you’ll be forced to leave most of her things behind when you make for the mountains tomorrow. Still, you think you can make use of some of the supplies she had tucked away."
msgstr "对于一个自傲于组织能力的人来说，高田的机械物资放的简直一团糟。如果你不了解，会认为高田储存东西的方式毫无道理可言——但对她来说，你怀疑她有某种系统化的安排。你花了几分钟在她的遗物中寻找可能对探险队其他成员有价值的东西。没有高田，你无法将最后一架飞机修整成可以起飞的状态。事实上，你想像著当你明天要上山时，你将被迫把她的大部分东西都留下。不过你觉得你还是可以利用她藏起来的一些补给。"

msgid "You do not find Eliyah. Instead, Anyu finds you. The enormous dog collapses onto your lap when you least expect it, nudging your face affectionately with her snout. You laugh and cannot help but grin as you attempt in vain to push her off of you. Slobber is one thing-frozen slobber another entirely. “Anyu, get down!” you hear Eliyah shout, and at once the loyal dog leaps off of you and sits nearby. “Sorry about that,” Eliyah says, sitting next to the dog and scratching her behind the ears. You shake your head and tell him that it's nice to have a reason to smile now and again-even with things as dire as they seem. He nods along with you. “That is true. Anyu has helped me through a lot of situations like… well, I suppose I have never quite been in a situation like this. But she has always been there for me. And she seems to have taken a particular liking to you, too.” As if she understands Eliyah's words, the dog gazes at you warmly. You smile again and tell her that you feel the same way. Anyu wags her tail. Bonding with Eliyah and Anyu makes things just a little better."

You turn in shock, prepared to see another one of those horrid creatures emerging from the ice—but it’s only Anyu, Eliyah’s loyal companion. The big gray dog looks up at you with pleading eyes. You shake your head and rise, heavy, to your feet. That’s enough mourning for one night. As you venture back to camp, soft footfalls trail through the snow just behind you. You stop and glance at Anyu. Once again, she looks up to meet your gaze. Is she looking for comfort, or guidance? You kneel and run your gloved fingers through her thick fur, speaking soothingly to reassure the both of you. Yes, Eliyah is gone. No, I don’t know if we are safe, either. Do you want to stick with me? Anyu wags her tail. <i>All right, then.</i>"

"You rise to your feet, shocked, and examine your surroundings. Your makeshift camp was protected from the harsh elements, but still deep in the Antarctic wilderness. And yet, you find yourself indoors, in a hall that you cannot place, though it seems familiar to you. You brush aside some of the snow that still lingers on the ground around your sleeping bag, noting a tiled floor that wasn't there before. A dream?\n"
"As you doubt the truth of this mysterious place, the walls and the tiled floor shimmer and fade. You are left back in the freezing cold of your camp, surrounded by your companions-except the door leading out of that hall still remains. Thick gray mist swirls around you, guiding you onward.\n"
