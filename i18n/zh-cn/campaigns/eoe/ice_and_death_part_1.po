"After two weeks and many hours of hard work, the expedition is ready to make its first foray into the cold, dead continent of Antarctica. Ms. Takada, along with two other mechanics, have fully assembled three aeroplanes along the flat ice shelf—a perfect place for takeoffs and landings. Your team congregates by the aeroplanes, along with several days' worth of camping equipment. The plan is to fly two of the planes over the vast jagged peaks, taking aerial photographs of the stone city mentioned in Dyer's account… that is, if such a thing really exists.\n"
"\"If we can find a safe landing zone, we will set up a temporary outpost,\" Dr. Kensler explains. \"Dyer, Danforth, Fredericks, and Claypool will stick around while the rest of us head back to base camp. We can use the sledges to ferry supplies to and from the camps. Otherwise, we'll simply scout out the area and head back to base camp.\" The team nods in agreement and begins boarding the planes."

"两周后，经过许久的艰苦工作，探险队已经准备好首次进入寒冷、死寂的南极大陆。高田女士和另外两名技师已经在平坦的冰架上组装好了三架飞机，那里是起飞和降落的完美地点。你的团队聚集在飞机旁，旁边还放著可供几天用的露营装备。计划是让两架飞机飞越巨大的锯齿山峰，从空中拍下戴尔叙述中提到的石城的照片……前提是，如果那东西真的存在的话。\n"
"“如果我们能找到一块安全的著陆区，我们会搭建一个临时的前哨基地。”肯斯勒博士解释说，“戴尔、丹佛斯、弗雷德里克斯，还有克莱普尔会留在那儿，其他人回大本营。我们可以用雪橇在营地间来回运送补给。不然，我们就简单地侦察一下这个地区，然后返回大本营。”队员们点头同意，然后开始登机。"

"\"Buckle up,\" you tell the others as you spin the propeller and hop into the pilot's seat. You motion to the pilot of the other plane, and both of you start your engines. One at a time, you take off from the ice shelf and soar into the opaque fog. You have never flown a plane of this size, but but it's no match for your piloting skills. Within moments you have a handle on the beast's clunky controls. The weather is another matter entirely. The rough Antarctic winds and harsh fog make for poor flying conditions. The deeper you head through the beautiful and deceptive polar mirages, the more you struggle to keep a handle on the aeroplane.\n"
"Dr. Kensler peers out a window as you pass a magnificent view of distant mountains like vibrant, enchanted castles floating above the clouds. \"They're beautiful,\" she remarks quietly.\n"
"\"These are nothing,\" Dyer begins, \"Wait until you see-\" And then the storm hits. The winter winds are so sudden and fierce that they almost force you out of your seat. Both planes shunt to and fro in the horrid winds, and you hear several of the passengers shouting behind you.\n"
"\"What in the hell?\" Fredericks grunts.\n"
"\"We have to head back!\" Claypool shouts. \"These winds will force us down if we keep going!\"\n"
"\"We're so close!\" Dr. Kensler growls bitterly.\n"
"\"We don't have a choice!\" he yells back, but it's too late. The plane lurches toward the ground, and you struggle in vain to regain control. All of the passengers notice the dark shape in the sky at the same time you do. It is a massive shadow, like a curtain drawn across the mountains, or perhaps the tattered wings of an antediluvian behemoth. It scowls at you with dreadful, hollow eyes. Then it reaches out, and—"

"你们飞过远处山脉时，肯斯勒博士看向窗外的壮丽景色，高峰就像浮在云上的魔法城堡一样，闪闪发光。“真漂亮。”她低声感叹。\n"
"“这不算什么。”戴尔开口，“一会你会看到——”\n"
"忽然，风暴袭来。冬季的风是如此突然和猛烈，几乎把你从座位上掀起。两架飞机都在可怕的狂风中来回颠簸，你听到几个乘客在身后大喊大叫。\n"
"“搞什么？”弗雷德里克斯嘟囔起来。\n"
"“我们得回头！”克莱普尔喊著，“如果我们再往前，会被风吹落的！”\n"
"“就差一点了！”肯斯勒博士痛苦地咆哮道。\n"
"“我们别无选择！”他大声回答，但已经太晚了。飞机突然向地面倾斜，你徒劳地挣扎著想重新控制住方向。所有乘客都和你同时注意到天空中的黑影。那是一团巨大的阴影，就像山脉上垂下了一道幕帘，或者可能是某种远古巨兽的破碎双翼。它用可怕的、凹陷的眼睛怒视著你。然后它伸向前，接著——"

msgid "No amount of preparation could have made your journey through the ice and cold any easier. Your months of training before the expedition kicked in the moment you became stranded, and you were even able to scavenge some supplies while you searched for a safe place to rest for the night… but your thoughts keep returning to the sight of the thing that made your plane crash, the horrifying abominations that pursued you through the snowy wastes, and the sound—that awful sound, that cry! You almost wish you could have been robbed of your senses altogether so as to spare you from the cry that now haunts your every waking moment. As exhaustion settles in and you drift off to sleep, still that sound echoes in your thoughts, over and over again: Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"
msgstr "再多的准备也无法使你在冰天雪地的旅途中变得轻松。探险前经受的数月训练在你陷入困境时有了成效。在寻找安全的地方过夜时，你甚至还找到了一些补给……但你的思绪总是回到那个让你坠机的东西，那个在雪地里追著你的可怕东西，还有那个声音——那个可怕的声音，那个喊声！有时你甚至希望你的感官能被完全剥夺，这样你就不会像现在这样，每时每刻都听到萦绕著你的喊声。当疲惫袭来，你渐入梦乡时，那声音仍在你的脑海中回响，一遍又一遍：忒咳哩-哩！忒咳哩-哩！"

msgid "As you make camp, you are haunted by memories of the creatures you encountered in the icy wilds. Such entities should not exist. Not even Dyer's report mentions anything of the kind. Grim silence settles over the expedition team as you set up shelter. No one speaks of what they saw in the frozen wilderness. No one speaks of the awful sounds those monsters made. You can only hope that this camp is secluded enough to avoid the attention of those things- whatever they may be…"
msgstr "当你扎营时，你被冰冷荒野中遇到的生物的记忆所困扰。这种东西不应该存在。就连丹佛斯的报告中，也没有任何地方提到过这种东西。当你搭建庇护所时，可怕的沉默笼罩著探险队。没人说起他们在冰冻荒野上看到了什么。没人说起那些怪物发出的可怕声音。你只能希望这个营地足够隐蔽，可以避免引起那些东西的注意——不管它们是什么……"
