"The scenery continues for mile after mile until at last you find an anomaly.  Some distance up the beach from a saltwater pool and near the edge of a dense forest sit the remains of a quaint cottage.  It looks like a disaster photograph, with the thatch roof exploding upward and the wooden walls splintering out, but with each piece suspended in air.  You approach the house cautiously, and as you circle the building, you see the White Rabbit - the same one that traversed Arkham not long ago!  The rabbit wails anxiously to two other figures that regard him sadly -  a man and a lizard.  \"My house, my poor house!  Oh the monster that must have done this!\"\n"
"The dirt-caked man shakes his head forlornly and strokes his chin as he surveys the damage.  \"And a monster that didn't even finish what it started, your honor!  It didn't think to let the pieces fall before it vanished away!\"\n"
"\"Never you mind the pieces, Pat!\" the White Rabbit snaps, \"Call someone to put it back together!  Oh, how late I shall be…\"\n"
"You take a half step forward, only for the grinning head of the Cheshire Cat to wink into existence before you.  \"The poor rabbit, not a roof over his head to speak of.\"  The cat's paw appears and gestures toward the shattered house.  \"As Gurathnaka claws at your world with its front, its back nails gouge into Wonderland.  The shadows crept at the corners until now, only seen by those who also lurk in the dark, solitary as oysters.\"  Its eyes glance in the direction of the beach and vanish, leaving only its smile to linger a few moments after.  You have only a few seconds to consider the cat's words.\n"
"\"You there!\"  You look down from the suspended grin to see the White Rabbit looking up at you haughtily.  \"Standing with idle hands when there's a monster about!  Come come, help Bill to find this beast and drag it back! It has much to answer for!\"  His finger points to the lizard who tips his cap back at you hesitantly.\n"
"Before you can reply in any fashion, the White Rabbit turns back to the cottage and resumes his despairing.  You rub the back of your neck, at a loss for words as you weigh your options.  Forced into work as you are, there's a chance you might learn something by venturing out into the surf."

"风景一成不变，持续了好几英里，直到你终于发现有异。在距离一个咸水池的沙滩往上稍远的地方，靠近一座茂密森林的边缘，有一个典雅精致小屋的残骸。它看起来像一张灾难照片，茅草屋顶向上炸开，木墙四分五裂，但每块残骸都浮在空中。你小心翼翼地靠近那间屋子，当你绕著小屋查看时，你看到了白兔，就是不久前穿过阿卡姆的那只！另外两个身影——一个男人和一只蜥蜴——悲伤地看著白兔，而白兔对著他们焦虑地大哭。“我的房子，我可怜的房子！哦，做出这种事的一定是个怪物！”\n"
"满身泥土的男人可怜兮兮地摇摇头，一边摸著下巴，一边检视著损害。 “而且还是个有始无终的怪物，大人！在牠消失之前甚至没有让碎片掉下来！”\n"
"“别管那些碎片，帕特！”白兔厉声道，“叫人把它重新组装起来！哦，我不知道要迟到多久了……”\n"
"你只向前走了半步，柴郡猫咧著嘴笑的脑袋就眨著眼出现在你面前。“可怜的白兔，他可没法遮风避雨了。”猫的爪子出现了，朝著破碎的房子指了指。“当古拉斯纳卡正面朝著你的世界伸出爪子时，牠后腿的尖爪则刺进了仙境。暗影原本潜伏在角落里，直到现在。只有那些同样潜伏在黑暗中的才能看得见，像牡蛎般孑然。”牠的眼睛朝海滩的方向瞥了一眼，然后就消失了，只剩下牠的微笑多停留了片刻。你只有几秒钟的时间来思考猫的话。\n"
"“那边的，你！”你将目光从挂在空中的咧笑往下移，看到白兔盛气凌人地抬头看著你。“有怪物出没，岂能置身事外！来来来，帮比尔找到这头野兽，把牠拖回来！牠有很多该负责的事！”他的手指指向蜥蜴，蜥蜴迟疑地向你脱帽致意。\n"
"在你能作任何回答之前，白兔就转身回到小屋，继续陷入绝望。你揉揉后脑杓，不发一语，衡量著你的选择。像现在这样被迫做事，也许进入海浪冒险之后，你有机会能发现什么。"

"Darkness eats away at the beach behind you as you escape the calamity.  The White Rabbit watches anxiously towards the commotion, and begins to panic as the darkness sweeps inland. \"The monster has returned!\" he shrieks, taking terrified backward steps, \"Not my house, anything but that!\"  He scrambles through the cottage door and shuts it tight before you can dissuade him.  You try to reason with the rabbit, hoping to bring him to his senses, but he remains locked inside in quiet terror.  As the shadows advance, you have no choice but to turn and flee.  You look back over your shoulder to see the White Rabbit's house vanish into the advancing darkness with the crunch and shudder of timbers.\n"
"Gradually, the flowing shadows creep to a halt, and like a riptide sweep back out to sea at the same speed that they consumed inward.  Wherever the darkness recedes, the landscape it leaves behind is warped and cracked.  You retrace your steps hesitantly, returning to the ground where the White Rabbit's house once stood.  Only scratched stone from the foundation remains, with no trace of the rabbit to speak of.  You can only speculate why the shadows lashed out as they did.  Perhaps your presence drove them ravenous for the taste of the real world, or perhaps they are merely running wild as their master occupies itself with Arkham."

"当你逃离灾难时，黑暗吞噬了你身后的海滩。白兔焦虑地看著这场骚动，当黑暗开始席卷内陆时，他陷入了恐慌。“怪物回来了！”他尖叫著，惊恐地连连后退，“不，放过我的房子！”在你能劝阻他之前，他就爬进房子的门，把门关得紧紧的。你试图劝说这只兔子，希望能让他恢复理智，但他仍然在一片寂静的恐惧中把自己锁在里面。随著暗影的逼进，你别无选择，只能转身逃跑。你回头望去，只见随著木头的嘎吱声和颤动，白兔的房子消失在不断扩张的黑暗之中。\n"
"流动的影子慢慢地逐渐停了下来，然后以它们侵蚀内陆时同样的速度，像激流般卷回大海。黑暗退去的地方，无论哪里，留下的都是扭曲、破裂的地貌。你犹豫地回到了曾经是白兔家的地方。那里只剩下地基的石头，满是划痕，没有半点兔子的踪迹。你只能推测为什么暗影会作出这样的猛烈攻击。也许是你的出现，让它们渴求现实世界的滋味，或者，也许它们只是趁著主人在阿卡姆忙碌著时到处撒野。"

"The dark creature's destruction sends out a force like the opposite of a shockwave.  A wall of stillness sweeps outward from the remains, and for a minute you can hear the blood rushing in your ears as the shadows evaporate before you.  The swell of the sea returns slowly, and the taste of the salt air rouses your senses.  The beach behind you seems brighter and warmer than before, and you take exhausted steps back inland.\n"
"Further back, amid the sedge grass and small dunes, you find the Walrus and the Carpenter lying in wretched states.  The sand around them is stained with darkness, and the last driplets of shadow leak from the corners of their mouths as they lie groaning.  \"A rotten bunch… it's shellfish poisoning, I'll wager…\" the Carpenter mumbles as he clutches his stomach.  The Walrus can only grunt painfully in agreement as it rolls to one side.  After everything this pair did to the oysters, and you besides, you must decide what to do with them."

"黑暗生物的毁灭发出一道力场，像相反的冲击波一般。一道寂静的墙从黑暗生物的残骸向外扩散，当黑影在你面前消散时，有那么一分钟，你可以听到血液在你的耳朵里流动的声音。慢慢地，大海的波涛回来了，空气里的咸味唤醒你的感官。你身后的海滩似乎比之前更明亮温暖，你疲惫地向内陆走去。\n"
"再往后面，在莎草丛和小沙丘之间，你发现海象和木匠倒在地上，状态很悲惨。他们躺著呻吟，四周的沙子沾染著暗影，而最后一滴的暗影正从他们的嘴角渗出。“一堆腐烂的……我敢打赌，是贝类中毒……”木匠捂著肚子咕哝著。海象只能一边翻身，一边痛苦地咕哝著表示同意。在这两个家伙对牡蛎和对你所做的一切之后，你必须决定如何处置他们。"

msgid "In spite of everything, the two gluttons are as much a part of Wonderland as the oysters are.  Everyone has to eat something, after all.  You take a small amount of time to help them recover from their possession.  The Walrus and the Carpenter give you no thanks, but they do comment on their experience of being overtaken by the shadows with rather embellished details."
msgstr "不管怎样，这两个贪吃的家伙和牡蛎一样都是仙境的一份子。每个人毕竟都必须吃东西。你花了一点时间来帮助他们，让他们从被附身的状态中恢复过来。海象和木匠没有对你表示感谢，但他们巨细靡遗地告诉了你他们被黑影控制时的经历。"

msgid "Weakened as they may be, the greedy duo is responsible for plenty of destruction and death already, and might rampage again, given the chance.  You quickly and quietly dispatch the Walrus and the Carpenter, who offer no opposition whatsoever to their demise."
msgstr "尽管他们可能已经很虚弱了，但这两个贪婪的家伙仍必须对大量的破坏和死亡负责，如果再有下次，他们可能还是会肆意破坏。你迅速且安静地送了海象和木匠上路，他们连表达反对的机会都没有。"

"The sand transitions back to dirt as you return to the White Rabbit's house.  You find that the suspended fragments of his house have collapsed down, and the rabbit is now fussing over the mess.  \"Dear, dear, another mess!  Where is that workman?  He may as well have been another monster, for all the good he did!\"  The White Rabbit snorts in frustration and turns toward you.  \"And you!  Have you brought the monster with you?\"  You do your best to explain the ordeal, and the rabbit nods along with growing look of disturbance on his face.\n"
"As you end your tale, the White Rabbit jerks with a sudden twitch and grabs for his pocket watch.  \"No, no, I'm even more late now!  I must hurry!  Must find my gloves, or the Duchess will be furious!\"  He dashes towards the door, having completely dismissed you in his hurry.  You quickly try to question the rabbit further about Wonderland and the dangers ahead, but your words fall on deaf ears.  The rabbit is absorbed in his new task utterly and will not spare a moment for anything else.  You depart with a sigh, resigned to spend your precious time elsewhere.  However, between the oyster's advice and your triumph over the shadows here, you feel as though you are on the right path."

"当你回到白兔的房子时，沙子在转变回土壤。你发现他家漂浮的碎片已经垮掉了，兔子正对这一片狼藉非常激动。“天啊，天啊，又是一团糟！那个工人跑去哪里了？他可能也是另一头怪物，看看他做了那么多好事！”白兔沮丧地嗤了一声，转向你。“还有你！你把怪物带来了吗？”你尽力向他解释了这场灾难，兔子不断点头，脸上不安的表情越来越沉重。\n"
"当你讲述完毕时，白兔突然抽搐了一下，然后抓住了他的怀表。“不，不，我现在更迟到了！我得快点！必须找到我的手套，不然公爵夫人会大发雷霆的！”他冲向门口，匆匆忙忙地想把你打发走。你试图快速地进一步询问兔子关于仙境和未来的危险，但他对你的问题充耳不闻。兔子对于他的新任务全神贯注，不会为其他任何事情分心。你无可奈何地叹了口气离开这里，节省你宝贵的时间。不论如何，有了牡蛎的建议和你战胜黑影的经验，你感觉自己似乎走在了正确的道路上。"
