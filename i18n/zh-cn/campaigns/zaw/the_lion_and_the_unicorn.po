"It's difficult to judge how far you've trekked through Wonderland.  Milestones and landmarks are few and far between, which makes the finding of an actual road all the more welcome.  A simple dirt lane cuts a surprisingly direct path through the countryside.  You follow it with anticipation building inside you as the dusty earth transitions to loose gravel and finally orderly cobblestones.  You scarcely have time to hope for any sort of relief before you arrive at the outskirts of a derelict village.\n"
"It's clear that Gurathnaka's minions have ripped this town apart.  Each stone wall bears the same deep gouges that you have seen from other sites of their attacks.  You watch each darkened corner of the village as you walk further into its heart.  As you near the center of the small town, the sounds of commotion grow steadily louder.  You peer around a corner cautiously and gawk at the sight coming from the village square.\n"
"A lion and a unicorn, standing on two legs each and back to back, are fending off an advancing crowd of shadowy beasts.  You watch in amazement for several moments as the two expertly combat the dark creatures.  However, as the din of combat begins to fade to ambiance, you begin to catch smatterings of conversation from the pair of animals.\n"
"\"You're slacking!  Positively slacking against these fiends!\" the Unicorn calls out from amid the melee, \"you're going to make us miss the refreshments!\"\n"
"\"Your complaining slows you!\" the Lion retorts with a growl, \"I fight twice as hard as you ever could!\"  The two continue their brawl, glancing with irritation at each other whenever they can spare a glance.  You consider that the two may have once been rivals before being forced into fighting the shadows together.  With each passing second, each works to deliberately put the other at a disadvantage.  Their wider swings clip each other, their poor footing trips the other, and their exchanges grow more and more volatile.  At the rate that they're destroying their own fighting chances, you have only a small window to act."

"很难判断你在仙境中已跋涉了多远。里程标记或地上景观很稀少而且相距甚远，这使得你对于能找到一条真正的道路更加感到欣慰。一条简单的泥土小道出乎意料地直接穿过了乡间。你沿著路走，当泥土地渐渐变为松散的砾石，最后变成整齐的鹅卵石时，你内心也渐渐充满期待。你几乎没有时间做好心理准备，就来到了一个废弃村庄的外缘。\n"
"显然古拉斯纳卡的爪牙已经把这个小镇摧残殆尽。每面石墙上都有深深的凿痕，和你在其他受到攻击的地方看到的一样。你盯著村庄里的每个被暗影侵蚀的角落，继续走向村庄中心。你越靠近中心，传来的骚动的声音就越来越大声。你在转角处小心翼翼地偷瞄，然后目瞪口呆地看著村庄广场的景象。\n"
"一头狮子和一只独角兽，各自用两条腿站著，背靠著背，抵挡著一群进犯的暗影野兽。有一会儿，你惊叹地看著他们熟练地与黑暗生物战斗。然而，随著战斗的声音逐渐淡出背景，你开始听到这两个动物零星的对话。\n"
"“你在偷懒！对付这些恶魔越来越懈怠！”独角兽在混战中喊道，“你会让我们错过点心的！”\n"
"“你的抱怨才让你变慢了！”狮子咆哮著反驳道，“我的战斗力至少是你的两倍！”他们继续争吵，只要有空档，就互相怒气冲冲地瞪对方一眼。你觉得他们两人可能原本是竞争对手，然后才被迫一起对抗暗影。随著一秒一秒过去，他们开始故意使对方处于不利的位置。他们挥舞的动作越来越大，互相碰撞；站位越来越糟，互相绊倒；他们的争吵越来越多也越来越激烈。以他们毁掉自己的战斗胜机的速度，你只有很短暂的时间可以采取行动。"

"You decide that the risk of facing down another horde of shadows is worth gaining a few new allies.  You rush out from the building and begin pummeling the closest of Gurathnaka's minions.  The Lion and the Unicorn regard you strangely, but allow you to join them in standing back to back against the shadows.  You bark orders at them to shape up and focus on their foes, and while the rivals don't respond verbally, they obey to keep the fight going.\n"
"You've never seen this many of the shadows attacking the same spot at once.  Their relentless assault doesn't give you an opportunity to consider anything but staying alive, however.  Monster after monster hurl themselves at you, clawing and biting savagely, but repelled time and time again.  For minutes, the melee drags on until at last the flow of enemies evaporates.  You stand raggedly, as do the Lion and the Unicorn, utterly exhausted and not a bit bruised from the attacks.\n"
"\"Plum cake!\" the Lion calls out, and the Unicorn echoes his strange demand, \"this sort of fight deserves a king's refreshment!\"  You don't have anything to offer the duo, though you do pose them several questions.\n"
"\"You may have fought well, but don't think you're anywhere near our mark!\" the Unicorn brags down to you, \"the crown must go to one of us two - me to be precise.\"  The Lion scoffs and attempts to rebuff the claim, but you ignore his grumbling.  You explain that whatever crown they're fighting for is nowhere to be found.\n"
"\"The blackguards!\" the Lion snorts, \"stolen our - my - crown while they ruined our sport!\"  The Unicorn stamps its hooves in half agreement, calling for the crown.  \"We'll retake the crown and then fight for it once again!  See that we don't!\"  You decide not to raise any further objections as long as they've settled on working together against the shadows.  The less you have to reason with these mad animals, the better a time you'll have."

"你决定值得冒上面对另一群暗影的风险，以获得一些新的盟友。你冲出建筑物，开始接连击打最靠近的古拉斯纳卡爪牙。狮子和独角兽用奇怪的眼光看著你，但让你加入他们一起背靠背地对抗暗影。你向他们发出命令，让他们振作并专注于他们的敌人，虽然这对劲敌没有口头回应，但他们有照著做，让战斗得以继续进行。\n"
"你从来没有见过这么多暗影同时攻击一个地方。然而它们猛烈的攻击让你无暇考虑其他事情，只能尽力活下去。怪物一个接一个的向你扑过来，凶猛地抓咬，但也一次次接连地被击退。混战持续好几分钟，直到最后一批敌人消散。你破破烂烂地站著，狮子和独角兽也一样，彻底筋疲力尽，但完全没有受伤。\n"
"“葡萄干蛋糕！”狮子喊道，独角兽应和了他奇怪的要求，“这样的战斗值得得到国王的点心！”你没有什么东西可以给这两位，但你向他们提出了几个问题。\n"
"“你也许擅长战斗，但可别以为你能接近我们的目标！”独角兽向你吹嘘，“王冠必须属于我们两个之中——准确地说，是我。”狮子嗤之以鼻，并试图否定这个说法，但你忽略了他的抱怨。你解释道，无论他们争斗的是什么王冠，都已无处可寻。\n"
"“那些黑暗守卫！”狮子哼了一声，“他们破坏我们的竞赛的同时偷走了我们的——我的王冠！”独角兽跺著牠的蹄子，半表示同意，喊著要王冠。“我们要夺回王冠，然后再次为之而战！看我们的吧！”你决定不再进一步提出任何反对的意见，只要他们决定要一起对抗暗影。与这些疯颠的动物讲道理的次数越少，你的日子就越好过。"

"You hesitate to leap into danger of this caliber with only a slight chance of gaining anything.  You decide to keep hidden and turn your eyes from the fray.  The fighters' sounds of pain and anger are soon drowned by the flood of shadows, and silence returns to the desolate town.  You wait until the shadows fade back into the alleyways before you begin to make your way back out of the village.\n"
"You've scarcely traveled three steps before you hear a warped roar and whinny behind you.  The Lion and the Unicorn, oozing blood and tinged by the shadows, look to you with crazed expressions.  \"Look there!\" the Unicorn cries with a hint of a laugh, \"the thief stands before us in so bold a fashion!\"\n"
"\"Folly!  Folly and madness to stand so boldly!\" the Lion echoes.  You can't imagine what they'd call you a thief for, but with appearances like that, they're clearly beyond reason.  The pair of corrupted beasts lunge forward at you, and you take flight.  Down the twisting alleys of the town they chase you, each time vanishing into dead ends and reappearing from stone walls.  You begin to panic as you try to evade the violent duelists, watching each building with a growing fear.  At last a gap in the streets appears and you sprint out of the small village, still looking over your shoulder and at each piece of terrain as though the Lion and the Unicorn may leap out at you at any moment."

"你犹豫著要不要陷入如此的危险之中，但只有些微的机会能获得回报。你决定躲藏起来，将你的目光从争斗上移开。战士们痛苦和愤怒的声音很快就被暗影的洪流淹没了，寂静又回到了荒凉的小镇。你等到暗影消失在小巷里，然后才开始离开村庄。\n"
"你刚走了两三步，就听到身后传来一阵扭曲的咆哮和嘶鸣声。狮子和独角兽身上渗著鲜血，沾染著暗影，用疯狂的表情看著你。“看看这里！”独角兽带著一丝笑声叫道，“小偷用很大胆的方式站在我们面前！”\n"
"“愚蠢！如此大胆真是既愚蠢又疯狂！”狮子应和道。你无法想像牠们为什么会称你为小偷，但以牠们这样的状况，显然是没办法讲理了。这两头腐化的野兽向你扑来，而你拔腿就跑。牠们沿著村庄曲折的小巷追逐你，一次又一次消失在死胡同中，又从石墙上重新出现。你试图躲避这两个暴力的决斗者，开始感到恐慌，每个建筑物看起来都愈发令人恐惧。最后，街道上出现了一个缺口，你冲出小村庄，仍然提心吊胆地看著每个起伏的地势，好像狮子和独角兽随时都会向你扑过来。"

msgid "Well clear of the abandoned village, you try to take your bearings.  As before, it's difficult to find any landmarks amid the wide open fields of Wonderland.  The ripples of the wind through the tall grass give the appearance of waves of water, until strangely, you spot a hint of blue amid the pale green.  A river begins to wind its way toward you, as if being carved into the land as it traverses the fields.  This cannot be another of Wonderland's random occurrences.  Your thoughts return to Alice as you change course to follow the riverbank trail, wondering if her influence could create such a stream just like that."
