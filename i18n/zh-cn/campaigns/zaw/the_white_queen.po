msgid "Before you can leave the comfort of the room, you spot an odd undulation from a small central table.  Two items sit atop it: a chess board and a weathered notebook.  The board is strangely divided, one half orderly and pristine, the other cracked and warped.  The longer you look at the distorted side of the chess board, the more it seems to shift as if rearranging itself before your eyes.  Unnerved, you switch your focus to the notebook, only to find its contents written completely backwards.  You hold the booklet up to the looking-glass to reflect the image, and find a series of disturbing but intriguing passages concerning Alice's dreamland.  The margins of the book are filled with pencilled-in explanations of each that reference Alice, Gurathnaka, and shockingly, your own entrance into Wonderland.  You look around warily, wondering just who might be watching you even now.  The only certainty is that the answers lie somewhere beyond the door to the quiet room.  You brace yourself and head for the exit."
msgstr "在你离开舒适的房间之前，你发现中央小桌子上有一个奇怪的起伏。上面放著两件物品：一个棋盘和一个褪色的笔记本。棋盘奇怪地分成两边，一半整齐如新，另一半弯曲裂开。你越是盯著棋盘扭曲的一边，它越看起来好似在移动，就像在你眼前重新排列一般。你不安地将注意力转移到笔记本上，却发现它的内容完全反著写。你将笔记本拿到镜子前反射图像，然后找到一系列关于爱丽丝仙境的段落，令人不安但又耐人寻味。这本书的页边空白处用铅笔写满了对每段的解释，提到了爱丽丝、古拉斯纳卡，以及——令人震惊的——你自己进入了仙境。你警惕地环顾四周，怀疑现在说不定有谁在监视你。唯一能确定的是，答案就在这个安静房间门外的某个地方。你振作起来，向出口走去。"

msgid "Any one investigator may choose to add Looking-Glass Book to their deck.  This card does not count toward that investigator's deck size."
msgstr "任意一位调查员可以选择将镜中书加入其牌组。这张卡牌不计入该调查员的卡牌张数。"

msgid "The placid countryside does little to ease your mind as you continue your endless trek.  The dangers of Alice's dream world are constant, but inconsistent.  Any creature, object, or bit of scenery could prove to be a maddened menace.  You wonder if the threats are the simple corruptions they seem to be, or if they were always a part of Alice's mind, always ready to erupt during a vulnerable moment.  Should you find your way out of this strange place, would Alice be any the better for it, to say nothing of Arkham?  Your mind focuses on this dazed line of thinking as the landscape transitions from wide orderly fields to a dense tangle of flowers."
msgstr "你继续无尽的跋涉，即使宁静的乡村也无法让你放松心神。爱丽丝梦中世界的危险持续不断，但又变化无常。任何生物、物体或一段风景都可能被发现是疯狂的威胁。你想知道这些威胁是不是如同它们表面上看起来的单纯腐化，或者它们是否始终是爱丽丝心智的一部分，随时准备在脆弱的时刻爆发。如果你找到这个陌生地方的出路，爱丽丝会不会好起来，甚至是阿卡姆？当你专注在这些茫然的思绪上时，景色从宽阔有序的田野转变为茂密的花丛。"

"The path before you wends its way through a lush garden of flowering plants.  The many blossoms turn towards you as you pass, one by one, revealing cracked and distorted faces.  The flowers titter between each other with discordant chorus, watching and commenting as you walk.  They utter fatalistic words about you and your quest, and of the ever-growing hunger of Gurathnaka.  You hurry forward, doing your best to ignore the disturbing plants.\n"
"The overgrown garden finally opens around the base of a lone tree, under which an equally solitary figure paces.  The silhouette of a chess queen is unmistakable in the pale woman who mumbles to herself in a steady drone.  You approach, but she turns towards you with a distant smile before you even think to call for her attention.  \"Ah, you arrive at last!  I remembered that we would meet here.\"  You wrinkle your brow at the statement, only causing the queen to chuckle lightly.  \"And I recalled that expression of yours as well.  But it is no simple task, remembering the future.  Especially memories of such a dark and dismal future as yours.\"  She stares at you - almost as though staring through you - and you find her eyes pale and cloudy with a dark emptiness gnawing inward from the rims.  The White Queen's smile grows forlorn as she continues her stare.  \"Would you like to hear your future history?\""

"你面前的小路穿过郁郁葱葱开满花朵的花园。当你经过时，许多花朵转向你，一朵接著一朵，露出裂开、扭曲的脸。你走过去时，花朵发出不和谐的声音，此起彼落地嗤笑著，对你品头论足。对于你和你的任务，还有古拉斯纳卡日益增长的饥饿，他们说著宿命无法改变的话语。你加速前进，尽力忽略那些令人不安的植物。\n"
"过度生长的花园终于在一棵孤树的周围有块空地，一个同样孤独的人影在树下踱步。一位苍白的女人用稳定的嗡嗡声喃喃自语，轮廓很明显是一个西洋棋王后。你接近她，但在你想到要引起她的注意之前，她就带著悠悠的微笑转向你。“啊，你终于到了！我记得我们会在这里见面的。”听到这句话，你皱了皱眉头，但王后轻笑了一声。“我也记得你的那个表情。但记住未来可不是一件简单的事。尤其是像你这样黑暗凄凉的未来的记忆。”她凝视著你——几乎就像是看透了你——而你发现她的眼睛苍白而混浊，黑暗的空虚侵蚀著她的眼眶。白棋王后继续盯著你，笑容逐渐变得凄凉。“你想听听你的未来史吗？”"

msgid "The White Queen nods and opens her eyes wide, the cloudiness spewing forth like a plume of smoke.  The white haze envelops you in an instant, and for a silent moment you are lost in the fog.  The suspense fades slowly as the clouds collect into shapes, some familiar, others new and frightening.  The queen's voice echoes from all around you as you observe each of the figures, which morph and reform to reflect your thoughts.  \"Memories are strange things, you know.  Each person recalls them differently.\"  The nearest cloud takes on your own appearance, and the others drift towards it, forming a strange tableau.  The White Queen's voice continues, seeming more and more distant with each word.  \"There are those who say that the future is set in stone, but in truth, it is more like cement.  It takes some time to set.\""
msgstr "白棋王后点点头，睁大双眼，云雾像一缕轻烟一样喷涌而出。白色的雾霭瞬间将你笼罩，在无声之中你一时迷失在雾里。你悬著的心随著云雾汇聚形成各种形状而慢慢放下，那些形状有的熟悉、有的陌生而可怕。当你观察那些形影时，王后的声音在你周围响起，这些形影变形重组，反映出你的思绪。“你知道，记忆是奇怪的东西。每个人回忆的方式都不一样。”最近的一朵云呈现出你自己的样子，而其他的云则向它飘去，形成了一个奇怪的画面。白棋王后的声音持续，但每一个字都显得越来越远离。“有人说未来像是石头一样不会改变，但实际上，它更像是水泥，需要一些时间才能凝固。”"

msgid "The White Queen nods solemnly and begins to tremble.  \"Dear me… those who cannot remember the future are condemned to repeat it…\"  The rejection seems to drain the life out of her, and she collapses to the grass, looking up with a hollow expression.  The blackness at the edges of the queen's eyes begins to flow inward, erupting up as her pupils are consumed.  The shadowy flow splashes up to surround you, whirling with hurricane speed.  You stand in anxious stillness as glimpses of Arkham, Wonderland, and other yet darker visions all flash through the torrent.  Which are real?  Which have already come to pass?"
msgstr "白棋王后脸色凝重地点点头，然后开始颤抖。“我的天啊……那些不记得未来的人注定要重蹈覆辙……”你的拒绝似乎消耗了她的生命力，她瘫倒在草地上，一脸空洞的抬起头来。女王眼睛边缘的黑色开始向内流动，当她的瞳孔被吞噬时爆发了出来。暗影喷溅而起，环绕著你，像飓风般以极快的速度旋转著。你焦虑地静止不动，看著阿卡姆、仙境和其他更黑暗的景象在洪流中闪过。哪些是真实的？而哪些已经发生了？"

msgid "Between blinks, the enveloping haze vanishes, and the White Queen along with it.  You still stand beneath the solitary tree, but the surrounding flowers have all wilted.  You hold your breath for a moment in unconscious reflex as you wait for any faint sound from the eerie blossoms, but without result.  Slowly, their fallen petals shift on the wind, forming larger shapes on the dry grass around you.  Lines and contours run together, and all at once the image clarifies into Alice's sleeping face.  It shifts as if breathing in, holding for a moment before blowing upward in a funneled gale.  The petals soar, swirling around and suspending in midair to form a line - a path!  You're unsure of what state Alice might be in, but it appears that she still has the ability to help guide you through her dream.  You follow the floating blossoms out of the bizarre garden without delay."
msgstr "眨眼之间，笼罩的雾霾就消失了，白棋王后也随之消失。你还站在孤树下，周围的花儿都枯萎了。你反射性无意识地屏住了呼吸片刻，等待诡异的花朵发出任何微弱的声音，但什么都没有。慢慢地，它们落下的花瓣随风移动，在你周围的干草上排成一个很大的形状。线条和轮廓融为一体，图像一下子变得清晰，呈现出爱丽丝的睡脸。花瓣移动就像爱丽丝在吸气，屏住了片刻，然后向上吹出一阵大风的漩涡。花瓣飞翔、盘旋；悬浮在半空中，形成一条线——一条路径！你不确定爱丽丝现在的状态如何，但看来她仍然有能力帮助引导你穿越她的梦境。你毫不迟疑地跟随著漂浮的花朵走出奇异的花园。"
