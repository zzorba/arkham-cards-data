"The places in Wonderland where the fields and trees meet tend to spark the greatest suspicion in you.  The illusion of safety in the wide plains makes the darkened forests look all the more sinister.  Shadows flit around every fallen log and bed of moss, making each step forward a nervous one.  Where will Gurathnaka's hungry minions strike from this time?  As if to answer your question, a pair of dark claws extend from a rotted stump, but before you can beat them back, a shaking sound echoes from within the woods, and the shadows retreat.  Curiosity strikes you at the swift result, and you head a little deeper into the woods to find the source of the noise.\n"
"Even after what you've seen in Wonderland, the sight that greets you seems far-fetched.  Two rotund figures of indeterminate age stand in a clearing, fighting back and forth over a small object.  It takes a moment of observation before it occurs to you that the two look exactly like Tweedledum and Tweedledee from the old nursery rhyme.  They're currently tussling with each other over a toy rattle, which you quickly identify as the source of the strange noise from before.  You look to the edges of the clearing and confirm that each wild shake of the rattle causes the creeping shadows to shrink away.  Strange as it seems, it may help your mission to get that rattle.\n"
"You step closer to the two and try to interject, but the twins look to you indignantly.  \"It's rude to interrupt!\" Tweedledee snaps at you with a sneer.  \"Contrariwise, it's polite to say nothing at all!\" Tweedledum chimes in.  They ignore your attempts at reasoning and bargaining as they return to their tug-of-war.  \"It's my rattle and I shan't let you take it!\" Tweedledum grunts at his brother.  \"You've had your fun!  It's my turn now!\" Tweedledee spits back.  The two pull on the rattle until a wooden crack echoes out, and each collapses back with half of it.  \"You broke it!\" Tweedledum cries out, though his brother shakes his head and sneers \"Didn't!\"  The pair storm off before you can intervene or mediate, shouting threats of war at each other.\n"
"You sigh in irritation.  At first you consider just snatching the pieces of the rattle away from them, but your plan is quickly stifled by the sudden appearance of two massive armies of figures.  One battalion is made of living playing cards, and the other of living chess pieces, each siding with one of the Tweedles, who are busy strapping household objects to themselves for protection.  The Cheshire Cat appears between you with the same telltale grin, but a roll of his eyes.  \"Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle.  Surely you know the rest,\" it purrs as the combatants take places across a small wooded valley from each other.  Once again, you've been caught up in the nonsense of Wonderland's strange citizens.  Still, if at all possible, you've got to get your hands on that rattle."

"仙境中田野和树木的交界处往往是让你最为警惕的地方。广阔平原上安全的错觉让漆黑的森林显得更加险恶。暗影在每个倒下的树干和苔藓丛上掠过，踏出的每一步都令人紧张万分。古拉斯纳卡的饥饿爪牙们这次将从何处袭击？彷佛是在回答你的问题，一双漆黑的爪子从一根腐烂的树桩上伸出来，但还没等你将它们击退，树林中就传来一阵颤抖的声音，暗影随之退去。你很快就按捺不住好奇心，向树林深处走去，寻找噪音的来源。\n"
"即使在你已在仙境中见闻了许多，你面前的景像也令你难以置信。两个看不出年龄的圆滚滚的身影站在一片空地上，为了一个小东西有来有往地打架。你花了一点时间观察，才发现这两个人看起来与古老童谣中的崔德顿和崔德迪完全一样。他们正在为了一个玩具拨浪鼓争吵，你很快就发现这就是之前奇怪噪音的来源。你望向空地的边缘，发现每当拨浪鼓狂乱的摇动时，蔓延的暗影都会缩小。虽然看似奇怪，但取得拨浪鼓可能对你的任务会有帮助。\n"
"你靠近两人并试图插话，但双胞胎愤怒地看著你。“打断别人是不礼貌的！”崔德迪冲著你冷笑。“反之，什么都不说才是礼貌的！”崔德顿附和道。他们无视你的尝试劝说和讨价还价，回到他们的拉锯战里。“这是我的拨浪鼓，我不会让你拿走的！”崔德顿对他的兄弟咕哝道。“你已经玩过了！现在轮到我了！”崔德迪回嘴道。两人拉扯著拨浪鼓，直到响起一道木头裂开的声音，然后双方各拿著半个拨浪鼓倒在地上。“你把它弄坏了！”崔德顿大叫，而他的兄弟摇著头讥笑道：“才怪！”在你能介入或调解之前，这对双胞胎就暴走了，互相喊著威胁要大战。\n"
"你恼怒地叹了口气。本来你考虑直接从他们手中抢走拨浪鼓的碎片，但你的计划很快就被突然出现的两支庞大的军队所阻止。一支军队由会动的扑克牌组成，另一支由会动的西洋棋子组成，各自支持其中一个崔德兄弟，而崔德兄弟正忙著将各种家用物品绑在自己身上作为防护。柴郡猫出现在你们中间，带著同样的咧笑，但翻著白眼。“崔德顿和崔德迪决定要进行一场战役。剩下的你都知道。”当战斗人员隔著一个树木繁茂的小山谷彼此对峙时，牠发出呼噜声。你再一次被卷入了仙境奇怪居民的荒谬事件之中。不过，你还是得尽可能地拿到那个拨浪鼓。"

msgid "The battle has escalated to a war.  You are barely able to drag yourself out of the valley as the armies all stampede down the slopes to clash between.  You pause a short distance away to recover, and scarcely a minute passes before the din of the battle ceases abruptly.  You hesitantly and painfully make your way back to the edge of the basin, only to find that the cards and chess pieces have departed.  Lying crumpled in the center of the valley are the corpses of Tweedledum and Tweedledee, hands at each others' throats.  You swallow grimly and try to recover the rattle pieces from their bodies, but you find them battered beyond recognition.  An unfortunate setback, but one you will have to live with."
msgstr "战斗升级为大战。军队从山坡上奔涌下来在中间互相冲撞，你几乎无法逃出山谷。你在不远处停下来恢复，不到一分钟，战斗的喧嚣就突然停止了。你迟疑又痛苦地回到谷地边缘，却发现扑克牌和棋子们都已经离开。崔德顿和崔德迪的尸体惨兮兮地躺在山谷中央，双手互相掐著对方的喉咙。你面无表情地咽了一口口水，试著从他们身上取得拨浪鼓的碎片，但你发现碎片已被摧残得面目全非。这是个不幸的挫折，但你必须接受这个现实。"

msgid "The cards and chess pieces immediately stop their fighting, some mid-swing as one of the Tweedles drops dead on the battlefield.  You approach with a disappointed sigh, intending to retrieve his piece of the rattle, only to be interrupted by the approach of his brother.  \"He's… he's dead!  That'll teach him to…\" his lip quivers and he swallows a whimper.  \"This battle wasn't my fault!  Twasn't at all!\"  The living twin takes out his piece of the rattle and clutches it in one fist as he fights tears.  \"It wasn't fair!  I only wanted the rattle, and he was being greedy!\"  His eyes snap to you as you loom over his brother's body, and his brow sinks in fury.  \"You want to take the rattle from me too!  You shan't!\"  The cards and chess pieces crowd around the Tweedles, raising their weapons towards you as you weigh your decisions carefully."
msgstr "当其中一个崔德兄弟倒在战场上死去时，纸牌和棋子们立即停止了战斗，有的还挥舞到一半。你失望地叹著气走过去，打算取回他的拨浪鼓，他的兄弟却靠近打断你。“他……他死了！这个教训给他……”他的嘴唇颤抖著，吞下了一声呜咽。“这场战斗不是我的错！肯定不是！”活下来的双胞胎拿出他那一半的拨浪鼓，手上握拳紧紧抓住它，一边强忍著泪水。“不公平！我只是想要拨浪鼓，是他太贪心了！”当你在他兄弟的尸体上找东西时，他突然眼睛盯著你，眉毛愤怒地沉了下来。“你也想从我这里夺走拨浪鼓！不行！”你小心地思考你的决定，而纸牌和棋子聚集在崔德兄弟周围，朝著你举起武器。"

msgid "The threat of the cards and chess pieces isn't enough to dissuade you from the rattle.  You won't walk away from this battle empty-handed, after all this.  Weapons out, you charge at the remaining Tweedle, who hollers at his soldiers to attack.  He's nowhere near a match for you, but the soldiers beat and stab you severely amid your assault.  As your attack hits home and the second Tweedle falls dead at your feet, the soldiers freeze in their tracks, their battle finally over with the deaths of both commanders."
msgstr "纸牌和棋子的威胁不足以吓阻你取得拨浪鼓。在这一切之后，你可不会空手而归。你掏出武器，冲向剩下的崔德兄弟，而他大喊著命令他的士兵攻击。他远不是你的对手，但士兵们趁你攻击时重重地击打和刺伤了你。随著你的攻击打中要害，第二个崔德兄弟倒在你脚下时，士兵们僵住了脚步，他们的战斗最终以两名指挥官的死亡告终。"

msgid "After all the mayhem of the Tweedles' battle, you decide it's better to cut your losses.  You back away from the corpse with your hands raised and allow his brother to rush in.  He greedily seizes the other half of the broken rattle and raises it triumphantly for the briefest moment before collapsing down to his seat.  The surviving Tweedle sits slumped by the body of his brother, bawling pitifully and shaking the broken toy as you make your solemn departure.  Such an awful state of affairs you'd hoped never to be a party to."
msgstr "在崔德兄弟之战造成的所有混乱之后，你决定最好该停损了。你举起双手从尸体旁退开，让他的兄弟冲过去。他贪婪地抓住了破碎拨浪鼓的另一半，得意洋洋地举了一会儿，然后坐倒在地上。活著的崔德兄弟瘫坐在他兄弟的尸体旁，可怜地一边嚎啕大哭，一边摇晃著坏掉的玩具，而你严肃地离开。如此糟糕的事态，你真希望没被卷入其中。"

"You assemble the pieces of the rattle as quickly as you can while the monstrous crow wheels upward.  Would the rattle work as it did before it was broken?  You cross the fingers of your free hand and shake the rattle wildly as the shadowy bird swoops down at you.  It dives within inches of your face, and you nearly cringe, but the shadows flow around you, and the crow feathers drift harmlessly down to the ground as the beast disperses.\n"
"A pair of terrified whimpers directs your attention to Tweedledum and Tweedledee hugging each other fearfully as they stare in your direction.  \"Tain't natural, not nohow!\" they mewl, \"and all for a rattle…\"  They look to the rattle and cringe in fear, the very sight of it now reminding them of the crow.  They retreat a short distance away from you and talk amongst themselves for a moment.  Finally, the duo shakes hands and walks away with arms over each others' shoulders.  It seems unlikely, but perhaps you've scared some sense into them after all."

"巨大的乌鸦向上盘旋，你尽快地将拨浪鼓的碎片组装起来。拨浪鼓的效果会像它坏掉之前那样吗？当那只暗影之鸟向你俯冲时，你疯狂地摇晃著拨浪鼓，另一只空出来的手则祈求著好运。牠的俯冲距离你的脸只有几寸，你几乎要畏缩起来。但暗影在你周围流过，随著乌鸦的消散，乌鸦的羽毛无害地飘落到地上。\n"
"你的注意力被两个惊恐的呜咽声吸引了，崔德顿和崔德迪盯著你的方向，害怕地互相抱著。 “这太不自然了，肯定绝不！”他们啜泣著，“只是为了一个拨浪鼓……”他们看著拨浪鼓，在恐惧中畏缩著，现在一看到拨浪鼓就让他们想起了乌鸦。他们逃到离你没有很远的地方，彼此交谈了一会儿。最后，二人握了握手，双臂搭在彼此的肩膀上离开了。尽管不太可能，但也许你真的把他们吓到恢复理智了。"

msgid "The rattle seems so ordinary, and yet you can feel some strange power within it.  It's a simple feeling, that a childish object could banish your fears and nightmares, but in Alice's dreams, perhaps there's some tangible truth to it.  Any possible weapon against the shadows is worth keeping a hold of, at any rate."
msgstr "拨浪鼓看似平凡，但你却能感觉到其中有某种奇异的力量。这是一种单纯的感觉，孩童的用具可以消除恐惧和恶梦；但在爱丽丝的梦境中，也许对有形的东西也能成立。无论如何，任何可以对付暗影的武器都值得拿到手。"
