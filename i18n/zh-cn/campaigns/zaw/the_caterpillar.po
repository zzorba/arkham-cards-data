"There are no established roads through the dense woodlands.  Each trampled trail you find works aimlessly back upon itself to the point where you make better progress forging your own path.  You walk for hour after hour, staving off the strange creatures and trying your best to make sense of the baffling landscape.  Your progress is further hampered as a thick fog creeps over the woods.  You can barely see the distance from one tree to the next, slowing your pace to a staggered walk.  Gradually, you discover an aroma mixed in with the fog, faint but strangely exotic.  The fog slowly transitions to smoke, giving you no further vision, but a clear trail.  You follow the strengthening smell to a secluded copse, covered on every available surface by a hundred varieties of mushroom.\n"
"Atop one of the mushrooms sits a large caterpillar lounging with a hookah beside him.  His eyes rise to meet yours, but he reacts with complete indifference.  \"Who are YOU?\" the Caterpillar demands with smoke streaming from his pursed lips.  You open your mouth to explain, but the insect holds up one of his many arms.  \"Explain once you are the correct size.\"  He breaks off a piece of his toadstool seat and holds it up lazily.  \"This will correct you.\"  You accept with no small amount of consideration, assuring yourself that this is the one case where you would reasonably take mushrooms from a talking caterpillar.  Within moments of taking the bite, you shrink down to a minuscule size.  Satisfied with looking down at you, the Caterpillar takes another long drag of smoke before he continues.  \"The other side will make you grow larger,\" he instructs, breaking off another piece from the opposite side of his mushroom and offering it to you.  \"Now speak.  Who are YOU?\"\n"
"It's a difficult task explaining the events that brought you here, made all the more uncomfortable by the Caterpillar's apparent lack of interest and attention.  \"Stop,\" he orders at last, drawing upward slightly, \"Where you have been and what you have done are quite different from who you are.\"  You try to tell a bit of your background and motivations instead, but the Caterpillar remains dismissive of your story.  \"You are not the same as you used to be,\" he accuses with a snort, \"Everyone changes, but you have changed far too quickly.  Discover yourself once more.\"  His many hands extend, offering his hookah pipe down toward you."

"没有既成的道路可以穿过茂密的森林。每条你发现的足踏林径都漫无目的地接回原路，直到你决定自行开辟道路，才稍微有进展。你连续走了几个小时，避开怪异的生物，尽力理解这令人困惑的景色。浓雾笼罩在树林中，更加阻碍了你的前进。你几乎无法从一棵树看到另一棵树，这让你放慢了脚步，蹒跚而行。渐渐地，你发现了一种淡淡的香气混合在雾中，带著奇异的异国情调。雾慢慢地变成了烟，虽然你还是看不到更远的地方，但却能跟著烟雾清晰的轨迹。你随著愈发浓烈的气味来到一个僻静的树丛，树丛可以长蘑菇的地方都覆盖著近百种各种各样的蘑菇。\n"
"一个蘑菇顶上坐著一只大毛毛虫，旁边放著一个水烟筒。牠抬起眼，与你四目相对，但牠的反应却是丝毫不感兴趣。“你是谁？”毛毛虫问道，从牠噘起的嘴里冒出烟来。你张开嘴正要说话，但这只虫却从牠众多手臂之中举起了其中一只。“等你的大小尺寸合适的时候再解释。”牠从蘑菇菌伞椅上剥下一小块，懒洋洋地递给你。 “这能帮你。”你内心强烈地挣扎了一番，说服自己这就是从会说话的毛毛虫取得蘑菇的一种合理情境。在咬下去的瞬间，你缩小到一个极微小的尺寸。毛毛虫满意地低头看著你，又吸了一口长烟，才继续说道，“另一边会让你变大。”牠一边说，一边从蘑菇的另一边剥下一块，递给你。“现在可以说了。你是谁？”\n"
"把让你来到这里的事件解释清楚是一项艰难的任务，毛毛虫显然兴趣缺缺，使你更不自在。“停，”牠终于要求道，微微抬起身，“你去过哪里、做过什么，和你的本质完全不同。”你试著说了一些你的背景和动机，但毛毛虫仍然对你的故事不屑一顾。“你和从前的你不一样了。”牠哼了一声指责道，“每个人都会变，但你变的太快了。重新审视自己吧。”牠的许多只手伸出来，将牠的水烟筒朝你递过来。"

"You take several short puffs of the hookah before your vision blooms with color.  You look to the Caterpillar and find him steadily watching you, perhaps the only anchored figure in the swirling smoke around you.  As the moments pass, you find that the color isn't a figment of your vision at all, but rather a projected light that forms a small mote in the surrounding smoke.  The points of light quickly multiply, shining through the haze in a mosaic pattern.  You look down at yourself to see the colors beaming back onto your body.  Where each light shines, a different facet of yourself manifests.  Courage and conviction intermingled with fear and apprehension.  Talent and ineptitude in equal amounts.  Shadows creep in at the edge of each facet, only to be banished by the overflow from other connecting lights.  The display cascades in front of your eyes with increasing violence, overwhelming your senses and spiking into your mind.  You lose track of the time as moments slip by in dazzling flashes.\n"
"Suddenly, your eyes snap open.  You are lying on the ground, nothing above you but the clouds of smoke, and no sound but the rushing of blood in your ears.  Your muscles slowly relax as your breathing normalizes and the forest ambiance fades back in.  The smoke parts around the stoic face of the Caterpillar, still watching you intently.  He scrutinizes you carefully, then at last gives a satisfied nod and long exhale of smoke.  \"You have found yourself, then,\" he states drolly, returning to his reclining position.  \"When you change now, it will be for the better.\"  You don't know what the Caterpillar expected, but you weren't prepared for this sort of introspective crisis.  Were you still yourself?  Was this all to spark some future change in you?  Or was it preventing a change by making you conscious of it now?  You rise with the intention of pressing the Caterpillar on what he just did to you, but to your surprise he has vanished completely back into the smoke.  You wait tensely, but in vain as even the exotic scent that led you to the Caterpillar fades away.  All you can do now is continue on your search through Wonderland, a little warier if nothing else."

"你抽了几口水烟，然后视线里绽放出色彩。你看著毛毛虫，发现牠一直在注视著你，也许是你周围天旋地转的烟雾中唯一固定的身影。随著时间的流逝，你发现色彩不是来自你虚幻的视觉，而是投射出的光线，在你周围的烟雾中形成微小光点。光点迅速增加，在雾中闪耀著马赛克般的图样。你低头看著自己，发现色彩重新回到你的身体。每一道光芒照耀的地方，都显现出你自己的不同的一面。勇气和信念夹杂著恐惧和忧虑。才能和迂拙是相对等量的。阴影在每个面向的边缘潜伏著，但被其他连接光线溢出的光芒驱散。画面在你眼前不断串联，愈发激烈，压倒你的感官并窜入你的脑海。在令人眼花缭乱的闪光之中，光阴流逝，而你已迷失时间。\n"
"你突然猛地睁开了眼睛。你躺在地上，你的上方只有云一般的烟雾；没有半点声音，只听得见耳朵里血液的鼓动。随著呼吸恢复正常，你的肌肉慢慢放松，森林的氛围逐渐淡入。烟雾在毛毛虫坚忍的脸周围散开，牠仍然专注地注视著你。牠仔细打量你，最后满意地点点头，长长地吐了口烟。“那么，你已经找到了自己，”牠滑稽地说道，回到牠斜倚的姿势。“现在你做出改变时，会往好的方向。”你不知道毛毛虫预期的是什么，但你并没有准备好要面对这场内省的危机。你还是你自己吗？这一切都是为了能激发你未来做出一些改变吗？还是透过让你意识到变化，来防止改变？你站起来，打算逼问毛毛虫对你做了什么，但令你惊讶的是，牠已经完全消失在烟雾中。你紧张地等了一会儿，但徒劳无功，就连引领你来到毛毛虫这里的的奇特气味也消失了。你现在唯一能做的就是继续在仙境中探索，真要说的话，也许更加谨慎一点。"

"The Caterpillar's indifference sours as he angrily yanks the pipe back at your refusal.  \"If you refuse illumination, then regret will be your only teacher!\" he snaps, sticking the pipe back into his own mouth.  You scowl in annoyance and prepare to give the Caterpillar a good talking to, but you stop mid-breath.  As the insect bitterly puffs on the hookah, shadows from the surrounding glade begin to collect inside him.  With each inhalation, he grows larger and more alien.  His scowling face grows feral, and he gnaws on the pipe the more it changes.  You take several steps back from the Caterpillar as he draws upward in a predatory stance.\n"
"Remembering the mushroom, you quickly devour the second piece he gave you, growing back to your normal size just ahead of the Caterpillar's own transformation.  The monster does not stop swelling, however, and you flee the smoky glade as trees splinter and fall behind you.  You focus on the mad dash ahead, still unable to see ahead more than a few yards, but spurred onward by the sound of cracking timber and scuttling of a dozen insect legs.  Something lashes out at you, barely missing your side and forcing you to veer off and slide down a mossy slope.  You barely keep your balance and crawl into a hollow log for respite.  Moments stretch to minutes, but the sounds of the mutated Caterpillar have vanished completely into the surrounding haze.  You wait in shaken silence for a few minutes more before finally crawling back out warily."

"对于你的拒绝，毛毛虫愤怒地把烟斗拿回来，牠的漠不关心变成了厌烦。“如果你拒绝受启发，那么你就只能从遗憾之中学习教训！”牠厉声道，把烟斗塞回自己的嘴里。你恼怒地皱起眉头，准备要好好和毛毛虫谈谈，但你一口气还没提上来就打断了。当这只虫在水烟筒上痛苦地吸吐时，周围空地的暗影开始往牠体内聚集。每吸一口，牠就变得更大，更陌异。牠皱著眉头的表情变得凶恶，咬著愈发变化的烟斗。当毛毛虫以攻击性的姿势抬起身体时，你连连倒退了好几步。\n"
"你想起那些蘑菇，迅速地吃掉牠给你的第二块，抢在毛毛虫的变形之前恢复到正常大小。但怪虫并没有停止膨胀，你逃离了烟雾缭绕的林间空地，树木裂成碎片，在你身后倒下。你专心疯狂地往前方冲刺，虽仍无法看清前方超过几码的距离，但木材破裂的声音和十几条虫腿的撞击声逼迫著你继续前进。有什么东西冲向你，几乎从你身边擦过，逼得你转向，滑下长满苔藓的斜坡。你勉强保持平衡，爬进一个空心的树干来喘口气。几分钟过去了，突变毛毛虫的声音已经完全消失在周围的雾霾中。你在颤抖的沉默中又等了几分钟，然后小心翼翼地爬了出来。"

The eerie silence is gently lifted as a small current of air begins to blow through the forest.  The fog separates around a long funnel of rushing air, providing you with both vision and a path through the forest.  You follow the wind, hearing faint notes in the rushing air that remind you of the everyday sounds of Arkham.  Could this be Alice's doing, manipulating her dreams to lead you home?  You cling to your memories as you follow the current of air hopefully forward."
msgstr "你再次离开了雾蒙蒙的森林，试图找出自己身处何处，以继续旅程。你几乎找不到地标，似乎又要碰运气了。一股微小的气流开始吹过树林，诡异的寂静轻轻地解除了。风吹成一个长长的漏斗，围绕四周的雾被分开，让你看见一条穿越森林的路径。你跟随著风，在疾速的空气中听到微弱的语调，让你想起阿卡姆日常生活的声音。难道这是爱丽丝做的，操控她的梦境，指引你回家？你以自己的回忆作为支柱，随著气流满怀希望地前进。"
