msgid "Out the Looking-Glass"
msgstr "穿出镜子"

msgid "The scattered petals weave an inconstant route over the meadows and dales.  Your doubts are silenced as the flowers scatter in sight of an English country home, this one much more familiar.  The house is identical to the strange empty one that manifested in Arkham, though it is mirrored from what you remember.  You enter the house with a rush of excitement all the same, though uncertain what you will find inside.  Unlike the barren cottage you explored not so long ago, this house is filled with an uncomfortable clutter, and most of it levitating in random spots.  Finding a passage through the rooms proves more difficult than you expected, but at last you make your way to the strange parlor you briefly viewed through the mirror in Arkham.  A mirror also adorns this mantle, but the reflection is clouded by darkness, so much that you can barely make out your own image on it.  You place a hand on the mirror and press gently, and it bows like a rotted timber.  With few other options, you scale the fireplace and lean forward into the malleable mirror."
msgstr "散落的花瓣在草地和山谷上编织出一条变幻的路线。你内心的疑虑随著鲜花消散在英式乡村住宅的景色中，这间屋子令你感到更为熟悉。屋子与阿卡姆中出现的奇怪的空房子一模一样，就好像它是从你记忆中映射出来的。虽然不知道在里面会找到什么，你还是带著一股兴奋的心情走进屋子。与你不久前探索的那个荒废小屋不同，这间房子堆满了多到令人不舒服的杂物，而且大部分都随机地四处漂浮著。找到穿过房间的通道比你想像的要困难，但最终你还是来到了一个奇怪客厅，就是你在阿卡姆的镜子里曾经短暂看到过的地方。有一面同样装饰著布幔的镜子，但镜子的反射蒙著一层黑暗，你几乎无法辨认出自己映在镜子里的模样。你将一只手放在镜子上，稍微按下去，它像腐烂的木头一样弯曲。在几乎没有其他选择的情况下，你爬上壁炉，向前探入能变形的镜子。"

msgid "Out the Rabbit Hole"
msgstr "跳出兔子洞"

msgid "Following the map to the best of your abilities, you skirt the water's edge before cutting inland sharply.  Some short distance through the underbrush, your path reaches its terminus at a door embedded in a dirt hillock.  With no reason to hesitate, you open the door and squeeze inside.  The other side doesn't match up with your expectations at all, appearing as a labyrinth of thousands of doors down several branching corridors.  Wearily, you trudge forward, picking a path and proceeding methodically.  Your method soon gives way to madness, however, as the tight corridors open up and the walls seem to fall away from you, as if ejecting from reality altogether.  Gravity turns at random, and you struggle for footing as the long hallways funnel up and down.  As the dread of being forever lost begins to grow, a blinding light beams down at you from a narrow tunnel.  Your footing slips once again, and you begin falling - upward, it seems - toward it.  With scant seconds to brace, you ready yourself for the worst."
msgstr "你尽你所能跟著地图走，绕过水边，然后急速切入内陆。穿过灌木丛一小段距离后，你的路径到达了终点，有一扇嵌在泥土小丘里的门。你没有犹豫的理由，打开门挤了进去。门的另一边和你的预期完全不同，看起来像迷宫，在几条分岔的走廊上有著数千扇的门。尽管很疲惫，你仍拖著脚步往前走，有系统地选择一条路前进。然而，疯狂很快就让你的方法失效了，狭窄的走廊变宽，墙壁似乎从你身旁掉落，彷佛完全脱离了现实。重力忽上忽下，长长的走廊像漏斗般上下移动，你挣扎著想站稳脚步。当你开始害怕要永远迷失在这里时，从一个狭窄的隧道中射出一道耀眼的光线笼罩著你。你再次滑倒，开始坠落——但似乎是往上——朝著那个隧道。只有几秒钟的时间能应变，你为最坏的情况做好了准备。"

msgid "Arkham Unravelling"
msgstr "解开阿卡姆"

msgid "You emerge to a view of utter pandemonium.  From the damaged landmarks you can identify, you stand on the border between Arkham's Northside and Merchant District, though the former seems nothing more than a shadowy void.  From the fading twilight, you can only conclude that you've been gone from Arkham a matter of minutes, in spite of the days and nights you spent in Wonderland.  Your bewildered observation is interrupted by an unearthly noise, one that you know in your soul could only be made by one thing.  You turn toward the south side of the city to gaze at the shadowy form of Gurathnaka."
msgstr "你现身的地方是一片地狱般的景色。从还能辨认的损坏地标中，你认出你站在阿卡姆北区和商人区之间的交界处，但北区似乎只剩一个暗影般的虚空。尽管你在仙境中已度过了好几个日夜，但根据逐渐变弱的暮光，你推断你只离开了阿卡姆几分钟。一种不属于这个世界的噪音打断了你困惑的观察，你打从灵魂深处知道这种声音唯一的来源。你转身面向城市的南边，凝视著古拉斯纳卡黑暗的形影。"

msgid "Alice Awakens"
msgstr "爱丽丝清醒"

msgid "\"Right this way, dear Alice.  They arrived not a moment ago.\"  From behind you, the familiar tone of the Cheshire Cat sounds, and you catch a glimpse of its fading smile as Alice herself staggers into view.  Her entire body shifts with relief at the sight of you in return.  \"You made it,\" she breathes with disbelief evident in her voice, \"I had hoped in earnest that you would, but in all my dreams-\" Alice winces in sudden pain and clutches her temples as Gurathnaka lets loose another unnatural roar across the shattered cityscape.  You help Alice steady herself and try to gauge her state of mind."
msgstr "“往这儿走，亲爱的爱丽丝。他们刚刚到达不久。”柴郡猫熟悉的声音在你身后响起，当爱丽丝摇摇晃晃地出现在你眼前时，你瞥见了牠逐渐消失的微笑。看到你时，爱丽丝的整个身体放松了下来。“你成功了！”她的声音中透露出一丝难以置信，“我原本真心希望你能做到，但在我所有的梦境里——”古拉斯纳卡再次发出邪秽的吼叫声，响彻整个破碎的城市，而爱丽丝突然痛苦地畏缩著，捂著太阳穴。你扶著爱丽丝，并试著评估她的心里状态。"

msgid "Absent Minded"
msgstr "心念缺失"

msgid "Alice looks almost as if she is in shock.  Her eyes jitter slightly as she tries to focus her vision, and she moves as though in a trance.  \"I feel empty, in some strange way,\" Alice murmurs, \"but empty is preferable to dead.\"  You advise Alice not to strain herself, but she shakes her head forlornly as she looks to Gurathnaka across the river.  \"If not now, then when?\""
msgstr "爱丽丝看起来几乎像是受到了惊吓。当她试图集中视线时，她的眼睛微微抖动，动作彷佛在催眠状态中。“我感觉很空虚，以某种奇怪的方式。”爱丽丝喃喃道，“但空虚总比死掉好。”你建议爱丽丝不要勉强自己，但她无奈地摇摇头，望向河对岸的古拉斯纳卡。“现在不做，要等到什么时候？”"

msgid "Half a Mind"
msgstr "心神恍惚"

msgid "Alice takes several moments to compose herself before she looks to you, still a bit dazed.  \"I feel like a jigsaw puzzle, only halfway finished,\" she says with a hollow voice.  You suggest that Alice take some time to recover, but she refuses as her gaze drifts to Gurathnaka nearby.  \"Rest will only be of help once we've banished these terrible creatures.  I cannot sit idly by.\""
msgstr "爱丽丝花了好一会儿才镇定下来，然后看向你，仍然有些茫然。“我感觉就像一个只完成了一半的拼图。”她用空洞的声音说道。你建议爱丽丝多花一些时间恢复，但她的目光转向附近的古拉斯纳卡，拒绝了你。“只有在我们驱逐了这些可怕的生物后，才能真正好好休息。我不能袖手旁观。”"

msgid "Presence of Mind"
msgstr "镇定自若"

msgid "Alice grits her teeth and her eyes snap open, conviction shining in them.  \"I feel the strain of those monsters on my mind, but I can bear it.\"  You try to help Alice to a more comfortable position to rest, but she places a hand on your shoulder reassuringly.  \"I shall be alright.  It is your city and our world that are most at risk right now.  After all that you have done on my behalf, I must help you however I can.\""
msgstr "爱丽丝咬紧牙关，猛地睁开眼睛，眼中闪烁著坚定的信念。“我感受到了那些怪物的拉扯，但我撑得住。”你试著帮爱丽丝换一个更舒适的姿势休息，但她将一只手放在你的肩膀上，让你放心。“我没事的。现在最危险的是你的城市、我们的世界。你为我做了这么多，我必须尽我所能帮助你。”"

You look to Alice nearby, dazed and despairing as you are, and the grim thought occurs to you: Gurathnaka is using her dreams for this invasion.

Your head thrums and your entire body aches as you gather your bearings.  It soon becomes clear that you are lying in one of the many beds of St. Mary's Hospital, with bandages and casts wrapped tightly in place.  You lie in a daze until a nurse approaches you with a relaxed manner.  \"You're lucky to be alive!\" she encourages, inspecting some of your more superficial wounds, \"You must have been hit by a car or something even larger!\"  Questions flow out of your mouth, and the nurse responds without the least bit of concern.

Not even the stars shine down to light the world's end.  Gurathnaka feeds and grows, consuming buildings, then blocks, acres, counties, and ever larger meals.  Its hunger is bottomless, and its minions take after their master in fighting over the scraps of the most decadent feast of all.  Alice is kept alive throughout, and she holds out hope that somewhere, someone in the world can reverse this cataclysm, but in vain.  The great masters of magic and mystery have no time to prepare against Gurathnaka's hunger, and what little resistance they offer does as much good as a candle in a coffin.  Shadows eclipse the Earth, and only once every other molecule has been consumed do the fiends turn and devour Alice and her dreams.  And then, from the void of space, Gurathnaka and its minions return to the Dreamlands, licking their chops for the extinct taste of Earth and its people."

From a nearby lamppost, Alice looks to you with uncertainty, and your eyes meet for a brief second before your vision is blinded with dazzling light.\n"

Can you remember the last thing that happened to you?\"  You probe with general questions, trying to figure out just what has happened to Arkham, but the nurse isn't concerned in the least.  The shadows, the brief overlap with Wonderland, and the distorting chaos all fail to get any reaction out of her, other than a suspicious smile.  \"Now it's none of my business, but you really ought to be more careful if you're, erm… drinking anything stronger than water.  Next time, you could end up with more than a few bruises!  Don't worry, your secret is safe here.\"  You attempt to reason with the nurse, but she simply pats you on the hand and insists you eat.

"你被裂隙崩塌的力量推倒在地，一股狂风在你身边像鞭子般刮过，你蹲下来躲避。神奇的变化让现实重新排序，彻底恢复了北区和商业区暂时崩毁的混乱局面。你将手指戳进鹅卵石的缝隙中撑著，在一团混乱中保住宝贵的性命。爱丽丝从附近的灯柱犹疑地看著你，你们的视线交会了一瞬间，然后你的视线就被耀眼的光芒蒙蔽了。\n"
"当你再次睁开眼睛时，你面前是圣玛丽医院一间病房里单调的墙纸和昏暗的灯光。你摇摇晃晃地坐起来，对于战斗最后时刻的记忆模糊且片段。当护士为你送来少许食物时，你还没完全整理好思绪。“你醒来了！你还记得发生在你身上的最后一件事吗？”你用一些普通的问题试探，试著弄清楚阿卡姆发生了什么事，但护士对此一点也不担心。暗影、与仙境暂时的交叠，还有扭曲的混乱，都没有让她有任何反应，除了怀疑的笑容。“虽然不关我的事，但如果你要，呃……喝一些比水还更猛的东西，真的应该更加小心。下一次，你可能不会只有几处瘀伤！别担心，我会保守你的秘密。”你试著和护士辩解，但她只是拍拍你的手，叫你吃东西。挫败感输给了实际需求，你不情愿地接受了食物，但你仍然坚持要尽快给你一份报纸。"
