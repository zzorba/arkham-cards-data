msgid "The endless march down the corridor of doors ends at long last as the hallway dead-ends in a small enclave.  In the center of the area stands a glass table with two curious objects on top: a bottle labeled \"DRINK ME,\" and a cake with the words \"EAT ME\" written in its decorations.  You scan the walls for any other way forward, and are shocked to discover an open door, only one that is scarcely knee high and impossible to squeeze through.  With endless wandering as your only alternative, you resolve to find a way through.  Minutes pass without success, and you return to consider the strange refreshments on the glass table.  If this truly is part of Alice's dreams, then there's a chance that they might not be dangerous, and perhaps might even help.  You pop the cork on the bottle and take a wary sip, but the drink's effects quickly flow through you.  At first, it seems like the room is growing larger, but you soon realize that you are shrinking!  You brace for the worst, but find that the effect stops as you reach the right height to easily pass through the tiny door.  At long last, you make your way forward to the sights and sounds of a vast sea."
msgstr "你沿著满是门的走廊无止尽地前进，终于来到了走廊尽头的一个小房间。房间的中央有一张玻璃桌，上面放著两个不寻常的物品：一个标签上写著“喝我”的瓶子和一个装饰上写著“吃我”的蛋糕。你环视四周的墙壁，寻找任何可以前进的路，然后惊讶地发现一扇敞开的门，仅此一扇，但顶多只有到膝盖的高度，完全不可能挤得过去。你下定决心要找到通过的方法，但你能做的只是不断地原地徘徊。几分钟过去了，毫无进展，于是你回过头来考虑玻璃桌上的奇怪点心。如果这里真的是爱丽丝梦境的一部分，那么它们可能并不危险，甚至可能会有帮助。你打开瓶子上的软木塞，小心翼翼地啜了一口，但液体的效果快速流过你全身。一开始，房间似乎越变越大，但你很快就意识到是自己在缩小！你做好了最坏的打算，但你发现当你缩小到刚好可以穿过小门的高度时，药效就停止了。最后，你向著一片广阔大海的景象和声音前进。"

msgid "Seeking Escape"
msgstr "寻找出口"

msgid "The crash of waves dulls as you make your way up the beach.  Each step through the shifting sands seems weighted further as you reflect on your choices and hardships.  Could your journey's end finally be over the next sand dune?  Does Alice's dreamland keep building upon itself infinitely?  Or is Gurathnaka actively warping Wonderland, keeping you from your goal no matter how far you may travel?  Dogged determination pushes you onward even as you question your steps.  Someone has to try to undo this madness, and if not you, then who?  Slowly you proceed, for good or ill."
msgstr "你设法离开海滩时，海浪的撞击声逐渐变得沉闷。你思索著自己的选择和艰辛，而踩在疏松沙子上的每一步似乎愈发沉重。你旅程的终点会是下一个沙丘上吗？爱丽丝的梦境世界是否会自己无限地扩张？或是，古拉斯纳卡是否正在扭曲仙境，使你无论旅行多远都无法接近你的目标？即使怀疑自己的脚步，你还是被顽强的决心推动著继续前进。一定得有人来尝试复原这一切的疯狂，而除了你之外没有别人了。无论是好是坏，你慢慢地继续前进。"

"A scene of commotion catches your eye as you step over a small dune and look down toward the shoreline.  A motley pack of animals dashes about, seemingly without direction or destination.  From the center, a Dodo shouts words of action as he runs a short rut in the sand.  \"Yes, that's it!  Up that sandhill there, down the other side!  There's no faster way to get dry!\"\n"
"Dry?  The suggestion seems absurd when most of their paths wander into and out of the surf.  You walk over to investigate the bizarre event, and notice the animals are in a sorry state as you approach closer.  Some of the less hardy creatures have collapsed completely, while others don't appear to be breathing whatsoever.  The Dodo urges them onward all the same, seemingly oblivious to their exhaustion, let alone its own.  \"The race must be run… until the race is won… come, you must join us…\""

"当你跨越一个小沙丘，俯视著海岸线时，一阵骚动的景象吸引了你的注意。一群种类各不相同的动物四处冲刺，看不出有方向或目的地。在中间，一只渡渡鸟在沙地上一边跑了一小段，一边喊著动起来。“对，就是这样！上去那边的沙丘，再从另一边下来！没有更快的方法来弄干了！”\n"
"弄干？这个提议看似荒谬，尤其是牠们大部分的路线都会穿过海浪。你走过去调查这个奇怪的事件，当你靠近时，你注意到动物们都处于一种糟糕的状态。一些没那么结实的生物已经完全累倒了，而其他动物也上气不接下气。渡渡鸟仍然不断催促牠们继续前进，似乎没有注意到牠们的疲惫，更别说注意到自己也已经筋疲力竭了。“必须继续赛跑……直到获胜……来，你也得加入我们……”"

"You hold the Dodo in place and assure him that the race is over.  \"At last!\" the Dodo cries out, \"The race is over… and everybody has won!\"  The other animals ease to a stop, collapsing onto the sand with relieved groans.  \"There must be prizes for the winners…\" the Dodo rasps, and he looks to you with a wild look as his frail body shivers with exhaustion.  You rifle through your pockets and produce a number of random items, which the animals grab covetously.\n"
"As the surviving racers begin recovering, the Dodo hobbles back over to you.  \"Fair play is satisfied!  We have been running the Caucus Race ever since the pool of tears ran into a sea!  Now at last, we are truly dry!\"  You humor the bird with a polite nod.  \"Finally, we can return to more academic pursuits.  Perhaps I may educate you on several matters?\""

"你抓著渡渡鸟不动，向牠保证比赛已经结束了。“终于！”渡渡鸟喊道：“比赛结束了……所有人都赢了！”其他动物停下脚步，倒在沙滩上，发出解脱的呻吟。“获胜者一定要有奖品……”渡渡鸟用刺耳的声音说道，牠瞪大著眼看你，虚弱的身体因疲惫而颤抖著。你在口袋里翻找，凑齐一些杂物，动物们贪婪地抓住它们。\n"
"当幸存的选手们开始恢复时，渡渡鸟摇摇摆摆地回到你身边。“这就是体育精神！自从泪水之池变成了大海洋，我们就一直在进行比赛！现在，我们终于真的干了！”你礼貌性的点点头，应付这只鸟。“终于，我们可以回来做更多的学术研究。也许我可以在几件事上教教你？”"

msgid "You give the Dodo a firm \"n\" and take a few steps back to let the strange animals continue their race without you.  You're not sure what stopping them would accomplish, if anything, but you don't have time to reason with these deluded creatures.  Before you can continue on your way, a rapid change sweeps over the runners.  Each frantic step they take sends out a noise like a cracking bone, and their gaunt bodies begin to wither even further.  The Dodo urges the racers to continue, even as his own body begins to skeletonize.  \"Onward… ever… onwa-\" the Dodo's final urging is cut short as his bones take one final lurch forward and collapse onto the sand.  You stare in bewilderment as the rhythmic sounds of the sea and wind replace the bedlam of the race.  Perhaps Wonderland is just as unstable as Arkham at this point."
msgstr "你坚定地拒绝了渡渡鸟，然后后退几步，让奇怪的动物们继续自己的赛跑。你不知道阻止牠们会有什么结果，或根本没有，但你没有时间和这些被蛊惑的生物讲道理。在你继续自己的旅程之前，这些跑者身上发生了急遽的变化。牠们迈出的每个疯狂脚步都伴随著骨头断裂般的声音，牠们憔悴的身体开始变得更加萎缩。渡渡鸟催促著牠们继续跑，即使牠自己的身体开始变成骸骨。“向前……继续……向……”当渡渡鸟的骨骸向前踉跄，倒在沙滩上时，牠最后的催促声终于停止了。大海和海风带著节奏的声音取代了比赛的喧闹声，你困惑地凝视著。也许现在仙境就和阿卡姆一样不稳定。"

msgid "You depart from the bizarre spectacle, following the shoreline steadily.  Landmarks are far and few between, making the beach seem endless in either direction.  As you ponder where to head next, the sound of the sea wind changes, and you hear faint tones resembling Alice's voice, though the words are indiscernible.  You look out over the surf, and to your astonishment, the tide recedes all at once, leaving behind an arrangement of stones and shells.  The debris portrays a vague map of your current position, with a series of arrows pointing down the beach and then inland.  You breathe a sigh of relief as you make mental notes of the map's layout.  No matter what lunacy may lie ahead, this is Alice's dream at its core.  You don't know what degree of influence she holds over Wonderland in this state, but it's one less burden on your shoulders."
msgstr "你离开了怪异的奇特场面，沿著海岸线持续前进。海滩上景物稀少，而且相距很远，使得海滩每个方向都似乎无穷无尽。就在你思考接下来的方向时，海风的声音变了，你听到了很像是爱丽丝的声音的微弱语调，但却听不清楚字句。你望向海浪，令你大感惊讶的是，潮水一下子就退去，留下一堆排列过的石头和贝壳。这些碎片画出模糊的地图，标示出你目前的位置，一排箭头指向海滩，然后指向内陆。你一边在脑海中记下地图的排列，一边松了一口气。不管前方有什么疯狂在等著你，根本来说这些都是爱丽丝的梦。你不确定她在目前的状态下还能对仙境造成多少影响，但这些至少减轻了你肩上的一点负担。"
