"You scour the newspapers in the days you are confined to the hospital bed for recovery.  Throughout all of them, you can't find any mention of the catastrophic events that nearly consumed Arkham.  You had hoped to preserve the city as much as possible, but it's almost insulting how little remains to prove your mission's success.  The possibility of it all being an invention of your own mind occurs, but you have no time to consider before the nurse returns to your bedside.  \"Excuse me, but if you're feeling well enough, a visitor is here to see you.\"  You sit up in bed with a surge of excitement as Alice enters your room with a small smile.  You both wait for the nurse to give you some privacy before she clasps your hand tightly.\n"
"\"You've done it!\" Alice breathes, trying not to shout with joy.  The relief on her face is plain to see, and she looks far better than she did when you first saw her on the train and in the asylum.  \"I truly can't thank you enough, especially as the evidence of all your struggles has all been returned to Wonderland.  You've done me - and the world at large - an incredible service.\"  You assure Alice that most of your adventures seem to escape the public's eye, but you would have done it all again in spite of the risks.  Alice settles down onto your bedside, and for a brief moment, her smile dips with sadness.  You ask Alice how she's been holding up amid all this, as the key piece of Gurathnaka's plot.\n"
"\"I don't quite know yet,\" she replies with a far-off look in her eye, \"I may never be the same again after all that happened, and this may not yet be the end.  I know that the shadows aren't gone for good.  I can still feel them grasping at the edges of my dreams.\"  Alice looks back to you gratefully and her smile returns.  \"But for the first time in over a decade, I can sleep without fear.  Both for myself and for the world around me.\"  You think back on your journey through Wonderland, and you ask Alice about what has befallen her strange dreams."

"你在被关在病床上静养的期间翻遍了报纸，然而却找不到任何报导提到这场几乎吞噬阿卡姆的毁灭事件。你曾如此尽心尽力地保护这座城市，但几乎没有对你任务成功的证明，简直就像是侮辱。你内心不由得冒出整场冒险都只是你的幻想的念头，但你还来不及细想，一名护士就回到了你的床边。“打扰了，如果你的身体状况还可以，有一位访客想见你。”当你看到爱丽丝带著微笑走进病房时，你兴奋地从床上坐起来。你们等到护士离开，然后她紧紧握著你的手。\n"
"“你做到了！”爱丽丝说道，忍耐著不要高兴地叫出来。她的神情明显看起来如释重负，而且她看起来远比你初次在火车上和在精神病院里看到她时好很多。“再怎么感谢你都不够，尤其是那些你努力的证据都回到了仙境，你为我——以及整个世界——帮了一个莫大的忙。”你向爱丽丝保证说大众似乎都没有察觉你们的这些冒险，而且要是重来，尽管如此危险，但你还是会再做一次。爱丽丝在你的床边坐了下来，有那么一瞬间，她的笑容里带著悲伤。你问爱丽丝，身为古拉斯纳卡阴谋的关键，她是如何从这一切中坚持下来的。\n"
"“我也还不太清楚。”她像是看著远方回答道，“在这一切发生之后，我也许再也回不去从前了，而且这一切可能还没结束，我知道那些暗影没有从此消失，我仍然能感觉到他们正抓著我的梦境边缘。”爱丽丝转头感激地望著你，她的笑容又回来了。“但是这十几年以来第一次，无论是为了我自己，还是为了我身处的这个世界，我终于能够毫无恐惧地入睡了。”你回想起在仙境中的旅程，询问爱丽丝她奇怪的梦境里产生了什么变化。"

The shadows were already trying to devour it, and it may not have lasted on its own otherwise.\"  She looks to you encouragingly.  \"But if your memories of Arkham helped to save it, then there may yet be hope for Wonderland.\""
msgstr "“仙境几乎消失了。”爱丽丝叹道，“但不要为此责备自己。你做了你必须做的以确保这个世界能够存续。暗影已在试图吞噬它，若是你不这么做，这个世界可能没法靠自己支撑下去。”她鼓励地看著你。“但如果你靠你对阿卡姆的记忆拯救了它，那么仙境可能还有希望。”"

msgid "\"But please, tell me of what happened while you were in Wonderland,\" Alice pries gently, \"even if nobody else in the world believes the sacrifices you made for them, I know them to be true.\"  You begin to weave the tale of your journey, and Alice listens intently, as if hearing of Wonderland for the first time again.  You soon discover that your audience has doubled, as the ethereal grin of the Cheshire Cat appears above Alice's shoulder, and its head materializes from time to time, listening as eagerly as Alice herself.  The minutes pass until finally, the nurse intrudes once more.  \"I'm afraid that visiting hours have ended,\" she says cheerfully before ducking out to pass the same message onto other rooms.  Alice rises with a final clasp of your hands, resolution clear on her face.  \"I've decided,\" she states plainly, \"I'm going to remain here in Arkham.\"  You raise your eyebrow in surprise.  Few people who know the mysteries and horrors of this town live to recount them, and fewer still willingly face more.  \"I've learned from several others in the city here that Arkham has many mysteries of its own.  If I can help to solve even one of them, then perhaps I can begin to repay you for your kindness and bravery.\""
msgstr "“不过，请把你在仙境中的经历告诉我。”爱丽丝温柔地询问，“我知道他们是真实的，即使世界上没有其他人相信你为他们做出的牺牲。”你开始描绘你的旅程故事，爱丽丝专心听著，好像初次听到仙境的故事一样。你很快就发现你的听众多了一位，柴郡猫缥缈的咧笑出现在爱丽丝的肩膀上方，和爱丽丝一样认真地听著，牠的头不时出现又消失。数分钟过去了，直到护士再次进来打断。“很抱歉，探视时间已经结束了。”她轻快地说，然后离开去其他房间传递同样的信息。爱丽丝站起身，最后握著你的双手，她脸上的表情清楚地展现出决心。“我决定了，”她直接说道，“我要留在阿卡姆。”你惊讶地扬起眉毛。知道这个小镇的奥秘和恐怖的人很少能活下来讲述这些故事，愿意继续面对的人更少。“我从这城市里的其他一些人那里得知，阿卡姆有许多自己的谜团。如果我能帮得上忙解决其中一点点，那么也许我能些微报答你的善良和勇敢。”"

"Hope you're all still sane!  And even if you're not, I hope you enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland campaign.  It's always been one of those stories that mixes whimsy and unease in just the right amounts, and it makes no secrets about madness.  The Alice stories have had darker interpretations in the past, from American McGee to Tim Burton, but each had their own stories that they wanted to tell.  My goal for this campaign was to stay as true to the books as I could while making it an adventure worthy of the Arkham Horror investigators.  I didn't want to just change Wonderland's madness; I wanted to add it to Lovecraftian madness instead.\n"
"I created the bulk of this campaign while the official Dream-Eaters campaign was still being released, and I intentionally avoided reading into it until I had the basics for the Wonderland gameplay set.  If there were going to be two campaigns about dream journeys and irritating cats, then I wanted to make sure that this one wasn't being a copycat.\n"
"There were three main challenges in creating the campaign.  First, I wanted to include everything from the Alice books that I possibly could, and to stay as true to those characters as I could.  The stories have an expansive cast, and everyone has their favorites, and I hopefully succeeded in doing each of them justice.  Some unrelated characters and stories had to be combined for the sake of individual scenarios, but in a sense, it was the only way to fit everything in.  In another sense, it helped with the second challenge: making the middle six scenarios scale properly from either side.  The interludes allowed me to give a spotlight to some characters that didn't fit into the scenarios while ramping up the difficulty both ways.\n"
"The third challenge was making Alice herself both relevant and central to the story without making her more important than the investigators, in a sense.  In my mind, she was important enough to be more than just an ally, so she became a full investigator, but only for the final scenario.  By including her fragments in each scenario and her indirect assistance in the interludes, it gave the players that she was accompanying them in spirit, and made her involvement in the final scenario a little more personal.\n"
"As a side note for the mythos involvement, I chose Gurathnaka specifically because there was little information other than that it was a shadowy eater of dreams.  This gave me plenty of room to improvise with the story.  Gurathnaka was created by Matthew Grau for the futuristic CthulhuTech setting, but future mythos must have been past mythos as well.  An ancient one's ambition to eat more than just dreams made the perfect catalyst for the campaign.\n"
"Thanks again for playing!"

"希望你们都还能保持理智！无论如何，我希望你能享受爱丽丝诡境梦游的剧本。爱丽丝的故事一直以来就是那些能恰到好处地混合奇思妙想和不安元素的故事之一，它对疯狂毫不掩饰。过去，从亚美利坚·麦基到提姆·伯顿，对爱丽丝故事的诠释较为黑暗，但每个人都有自己想讲述的故事。我对这个剧本的目标是尽可能忠实于书本，并同时让它成为值得调查员进行的一场冒险。我不想只是改变仙境里的疯狂；我想把它加入洛夫克拉夫特式的疯狂之中。\n"
"我在官方的食梦者剧本仍在发布中的时候构思了这个剧本的大部分内容，并且在完成这个剧本基本的游戏设定之前，我刻意地避免阅读官方剧本。如果两个剧本都与梦境的旅程和恼人的猫有关，那么我保证这些只是巧合。\n"
"剧本的设计有三个主要的挑战。首先，我想尽可能地囊括爱丽丝书中的所有内容，并尽可能忠实于这些角色。爱丽丝的故事有许多不同的角色，每个人都有自己的最爱，我希望能成功地让每个人都受到公平的对待。为了形成单一的冒险，一些不相关的角色和故事必须被放在一起，但从某种意义上说，这是将一切都融合在一起的唯一方法。另一方面，这也有助于解决第二个挑战：让中间的六场冒险无论从任何一边进行都有适当的难度。幕间故事让我能够聚焦在一些不适合放在冒险里的角色，同时从两个方向都能逐步地增加难度。\n"
"第三个挑战是让爱丽丝本身既与故事相关又能成为故事的中心，但某方面又不能让她比调查员更加重要。在我心中，她的重要性不仅只作为一个盟友，所以她成为了一位完整的调查员，但仅限于最后一场冒险。通过在每场冒险中搜集她的碎片以及她在幕间故事中的间接帮助，让玩家们有了她在精神上陪伴自己的感觉，也让她在最终冒险的参与更加个人化。\n"
"作为旁注，在导入神话时，我特别选择了古拉斯纳卡，因为除了身为一个暗影食梦者之外，它几乎没有什么其他资讯。这给了我足够的空间来创作这个故事。古拉斯纳卡是Matthew Grau为未来主义的克苏鲁科技设定而创造的，但未来的神话必然也一定是过去的神话。古神的野心不仅仅是吞噬梦境，正好能完美地成为这场剧本的催化剂。\n"
"再次感谢你的游玩！"
