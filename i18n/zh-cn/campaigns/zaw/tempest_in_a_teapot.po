msgid ""
"The scattered paths of Wonderland offer no more safety or direction than its wilderness.  Whether the roads have always been tangled or whether Gurathnaka has twisted the dream land is unclear, but you keep up your trek regardless.  At a crossroad at the edge of a large patch forest, you stop to consider carefully, only for the Cheshire Cat to appear once more on a branch above you.  \"I remember this spot well,\" he purrs, sweeping both his front paws to either side, \"In that direction lives a Hare, and in the other lives a Hatter, both quite mad.\"  You give an exasperated sigh.  Most of the citizens of Wonderland have been more than a little unhinged, but for the cat to make a note of these two speaks to just how crazy they might be.  \"They are likely to be at the hare's house, as it is nearly tea time.  Then again, it is always nearly tea time with those three.\"  The cat fades away once more before you can get any more details.  You puzzle over the cat's words carefully.  Tea for three, but he only mentioned the hare and hatter.  You expect it was the cat's way of guiding you to the third figure while maintaining its cryptic madness.\n"
"You follow the weaving road toward the Hare's house, unsure of what to expect.  The path veers off into the woods, but very quickly dead ends in a small cottage.  The house looks uninhabited, but the sounds of laughter and clinking of china lead you around to a side garden.  A long table stretches out across much of the small garden, stacked high with tea cups and pots, bread and butter, and all other manner of refreshments.  The Hare and the Hatter sit across from one another, conversing loudly, though their words seem like complete gibberish to you.  In the center of the table, a Dormouse peeks out of a teapot, disheveled and looking quite exhausted.  He looks up with drooping eyelids as you approach, looking as though he had something important to say but quite forgot it.  Before you can greet each other, the Dormouse's eyes close and he sinks back into the teapot with a long sigh.\n"
"All at once, as the Dormouse sinks to sleep, shadows sweep in from the edges of the garden.  You leap into one of the chairs, only for the Hare and Hatter to turn their attention to you with offended expressions.  \"No room, no room!\" they chide, seemingly oblivious to the encroaching darkness.  You brace for the wave of shadows, but instead, you feel a flutter in your stomach as your chair rises into the air.  The table and other chairs follow in short order, rising just above the consuming darkness.  \"It's very rude to sit down without being invited, you know!\" the Hare continues.  The Hatter nods in agreement before chiming in.  \"But since you're here, try to guess this riddle, if you can!\"  You nod half-heartedly at the tea party hosts as you begin to figure your way out of this dilemma."

"仙境里四散的道路没有比仙境的荒野更安全或更有方向感。你不清楚是否这些路本来就复杂纠结，还是古拉斯纳卡扭曲了梦境世界，但无论如何，你都得继续你的旅程。在一大片森林的边缘，你停在一个十字路口仔细思考，但柴郡猫再次出现在你上方的树枝上。“这个地方我记得很清楚，”牠咕囔著，将两只前爪扫向两边，“那边住著一只三月兔，另一边住著一位帽匠，他们两个都很疯。”你厌烦地叹了口气。大多数的仙境居民都有些精神不正常，但猫特别提到这两位，说明了他们可能更严重。“他们大概在三月兔的家，因为下午茶时间快到了。话说回来，对这三位来说，下午茶时间总是快到了。”这只猫在你能搞清楚更多细节之前就再次消失了。你仔细琢磨猫的话。有三位在喝下午茶，但牠只提到了兔子和帽匠。你认为这是猫在保持神秘又疯狂的同时，指引你注意到第三个角色的方式。\n"
"你沿著交织的道路前往三月兔的家，感到前途未卜。小路转入树林，但很快就在一个小屋前到达尽头。屋子看起来没人住，但笑声和瓷器相碰的声音引领你来到一个侧花园。一张长桌占据了小花园的大部分空间，上面堆满了茶杯和茶壶、面包和奶油，还有各种各样的点心。三月兔和帽匠面对面坐著，大声交谈，他们说的话在你听来完全是胡言乱语。在桌子中央有一只睡鼠从茶壶里探出头来，看上去衣著不整又很疲惫。当你走近时，他昏昏欲睡地抬起头，看起来好像是有重要的事情要说，但忘了是什么。你还没来得及跟他打招呼，睡鼠就闭上了眼睛，一边叹了口长气，一边沉入茶壶中。\n"
"就在睡鼠睡著沉下去的同时，黑影突然从花园的边缘扫了进来。你跳上其中一张椅子，但只见兔子和帽匠带著被冒犯的表情，将注意力转向你。“没位置，没位置！”他们抱怨著，似乎没有察觉到正在侵入的黑暗。你准备要承受暗影来袭，但取而代之的是，你的椅子浮了起来，使你的胃一阵翻搅。餐桌和其他椅子紧随其后，也浮到吞噬一切的黑影上方。“你知道，没受到邀请就坐下来是很不礼貌的！”三月兔继续道。帽匠点头表示同意，接著插话。“不过既然你已经来了，如果可以的话，猜猜看这个谜语！”你心不在焉地对茶会主人点了点头，开始想办法脱离这个困境。"

"For this scenario, most locations are much smaller than average.  Only one investigator or enemy can occupy a [[Chair]] location at once.  Investigators cannot enter [[Chair]] locations that are occupied by another investigator or enemy.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may swap positions with other investigators and enemies using the abilities listed below.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n"
"Because of these restrictions, investigators at [[Chair]] locations are considered to be engaged with each non-aloof enemy at each connecting [[Chair]] location.  Players may engage, attack, evade, parley, and activate effects as if those enemies were at their location.  Enemies may also attack and activate effects as if they were at the engaged investigators' locations.  After an enemy enters a [[Chair]] location, it engages all investigators at all connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Failed attacks against enemies engaged with multiple investigators do not deal damage to other investigators.  If an investigator moves while engaged with any amount of enemies at [[Chair]] locations, those enemies make attacks of opportunity normally, but do not move after attacking.  If an investigator or enemy would move to an investigator's location via a card effect, move them to the nearest empty [[Chair]] location instead.\n"
"When an enemy would move between two [[Chair]] locations, but its path is blocked by another enemy or an investigator who did not trigger this movement, swap its position with that other enemy or investigator.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n"
"Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may commit cards to skill tests performed by investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at your location may target investigators or enemies at a connecting [[Chair]] locations instead.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at connecting or other locations are unchanged.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may interact with cards in the threat areas of investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.\n"
"Investigators may take the following two actions at any time during the scenario:\n"
"[action] If you are at a [[Chair]] location: <b>Move</b>.  Swap positions with an investigator at a connecting [[Chair]] location.  This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the other investigator.\n"

Just when it seems certain that the end is upon you, the shadows freeze.  You are suspended for a moment before they recede suddenly, sliding off of you like water.  The darkness evaporates, leaving you in one of the tea party chairs once more.  The Hare and Hatter are nowhere to be seen, no trace of them remaining.  Mere feet away, the shadows condense around the Dormouse who is fast asleep once more, but whimpering and kicking as his nightmares overwhelm him.  There is no chance to save the poor creature, and you retreat from the garden before you are caught up in the shadows' embrace again."

"\"An excellent riddle!  Let's have another!\"  The exclamation snaps you out of your thoughts, and you turn to see the Hare and Hatter still seated around the table, sipping tea and smiling congenially.  You keep your distance, remembering how they behaved during the earlier chaos, but they act as though nothing had happened.  \"Come now, a bright guest like you can surely think of a riddle we haven't heard before!\" the Hare invites, bounding over to escort you to a closer chair.  Your thoughts jumble and your words stumble, but your recent experience inspires a question.  When can you be in the dark and in the light at the same time?  The duo scratch their chins and tap their spoons idly, spending several seconds in thought.  Finally, the Hare draws upward and raises a finger.  \"When it's day out, but you've no idea what's going on!\" he proudly proclaims.\n"
"\"No, no!  It's quite the opposite!\" the Hatter scoffs, \"When you know exactly what is going on, but it's dark all around!  After all, it was pitch black only a moment ago and we knew precisely what happened!\"  You raise an eyebrow at the suggestion that they were aware of the danger the entire time.  The Hatter pulls you closer and lowers his voice to a whisper that's somehow louder than his speaking voice.  \"Everyone is mad here, you know.  The things that make sense, well, those belong in Alice's world.  And the shadows are rather picky.  Why, poor Dormy here started making sense and they went after him just like that!\"  You press the two mad partygoers further, and to your surprise, they divulge plenty of details about Gurathnaka and his brood.\n"
"The Dormouse gives a long sigh and smiles faintly as he continues waking up fully.  \"They may be mad, but friends are friends.  I'm quite surprised - and happy, mind you - that you didn't give them a thrashing for their trouble.\""

"“真是个绝妙的谜语！让我们再猜一个吧！”惊叹声把你从思绪中拉了回来，你转身看到三月兔和帽匠仍然坐在桌子旁，喝著茶，愉悦地笑著。你想起他们在先前混乱中的行为举止，和他们保持距离，但他们表现得好像什么事都没发生过。“来吧，像你这样聪明的客人，一定能想到一个我们没听过的谜语！”三月兔邀请道，跳过来陪同你坐到更近的椅子上。你的思绪混乱，言语磕磕绊绊，但你最新的经历给了你谜语的灵感。你什么时候可以同时在黑暗和光明中？两位搔著下巴，徒然地敲打著勺子，思考了几秒。终于，三月兔抬起头并举起一根手指。“在白天，但你被蒙在鼓里时！”他自豪地答道。\n"
"“不，不！恰恰相反！”帽匠嗤之以鼻，“当你心中明白，但周围一片黑暗的时候！毕竟，刚才还是一片漆黑，但我们都很清楚地知道发生了什么！”你扬起了眉毛，发现他们一直都有意识到危险。帽匠把你拉近，压低声音耳语，但不知怎地比他平常说话的声音更大声。“你知道，这里的每个人都是疯的。那些有道理的事情，嗯……那些属于爱丽丝的世界。而暗影相当挑剔。因为，可怜的鼠仔开始理解什么的时候，它们就像那样盯上了他！”你向这两位疯狂的茶会常客进一步询问，令你惊讶的是，他们透漏了很多关于古拉斯纳卡和它的子嗣的细节。\n"
"睡鼠长长地呼了口气，虚弱地微笑，继续他完全苏醒的过程，“他们可能是疯的，但朋友就是朋友。我很惊讶——老实说，也很高兴——你没有因为他们的麻烦而痛打他们一顿。”"

Darjeeling, you know… it really is…\"  He collapses down into his chair, and soon all sounds of crying fade.  The Hare sits motionless with a pained face, staring off into the distance, pupils twitching slightly.  The loss of his companion seems to have cracked the Hare's mind entirely.\n"
"The Dormouse shakes his head pityingly as he looks to the Hare.  \"Poor fellow.  They were inseparable, you know, even in the midst of all this madness.\"  He looks up at you with a mix of resentment and acceptance on his face.  \"Do make their sacrifice count.
