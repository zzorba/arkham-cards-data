"Rarely in Wonderland do you see anything uniform or well-ordered, so it strikes you especially strangely when you happen across a grove of trees that have grown inexplicably into heart shapes.  The glade itself is also shaped like a heart, tapering inward toward an especially large tree with a red door embedded in it.  Whoever - or whatever - created this grove may be able to help you in stabilizing Alice's dreams.  You step through the door without delay.\n"
"The other side of the door might as well have been another world, as it leads to a vast garden surrounding an enormous castle.  The same heart patterns adorn each flowerbed and topiary bush, most decorated in a bright red color.  You have only a moment to consider who would be so fixated on hearts before a platoon of strange figures approach you.  The figures look like playing cards in all four suits, but each with heads, hands and feet.  The fact that they brandish spears at you vindictively takes some of the humor out of their appearance.  You raise your hands to diffuse the situation just as the ranks of the cards part.\n"
"Another regal figure walks proudly but aggressively toward you.  From her appearance, and connecting the look of the castle around you, it could only be the Queen of Hearts.  She keeps her jaw tightly clenched as she regards you with suspicion.  After a few moments, she begins to speak in a tone that suggests inner rage.  \"And who are you to intrude upon my castle?!\" she accuses gruffly, \"Just the sort of unseemly type to skulk and thieve!\"  You try to smooth things over with the intimidating monarch, but she scoffs openly at you.  \"Don't contradict a queen!  You appear scant moments after my tarts were stolen away, on my unbirthday, no less, and you try to claim coincidence?!  Rubbish and lies!  Off with your head!\"  She storms away, still bellowing for blood, and her entourage of soldiers merely bars your exit.  You wait for a moment in confused silence as nobody attempts to take you away for execution.  Either this is commonplace, or the executioner isn't a real go-getter.\n"
"The Cheshire Cat appears beside you once more, watching the queen and her soldiers depart.  \"Heady times indeed,\" it purrs, \"and you have the great luck of being here at the crux of it.  The queen does love her tarts so, nearly as much as she loves a good beheading.\"  The cat's head floats away from its body as he speaks to punctuate his statement.  \"They'll have a trial shortly, I should think, but were I you, I wouldn't want my name at the top of any lists.  Blame is the name of the game at the Queen's court, and you would do well to learn it quickly.  But I've every confidence in you.  You've a good head on your shoulders… for now.\"  It vanishes once more with a wide grin, leaving you to figure out how best to save your neck from the headsman's axe."

"你很少在仙境中看到任何整齐划一或井井有条的东西，所以当你穿越一片莫名地长成心形的树林时，你感到特别奇怪。林间空地也呈心形，向内逐渐变窄，对著一棵特别大的树，树上嵌著一扇红色的门。无论是谁——或是何物事——创造了这片小树林，也许能帮助你稳定爱丽丝的梦境。你毫不迟疑地走进了门。\n"
"门的另一边就像是另一个世界，它通向一个广阔的花园，环绕著一座巨大的城堡。每个花坛和修剪过的灌木都装饰著相同的心形图案，大部分都是鲜红色的。你思考著谁会如此痴迷于心形图样，但只过了一会儿，就有一排奇怪的角色接近你。这些人看起来像是扑克牌，四种花色都有，但每个人都有头、手和脚。他们恶毒地向你挥舞长矛，使得他们滑稽的外观不怎么好笑。当扑克牌的行列分散开来时，你连忙举起手投降。\n"
"又一个皇室的角色傲慢又充满攻击性地向你走来。从她的外表看来，再加上四周城堡的模样，她肯定就是红心皇后。她的牙关紧紧地咬著，怀疑地看著你。过了一会儿，她用一种显然内心充满愤怒的语气开始说话。“你是谁，竟敢闯入我的城堡？！”她粗声粗气地指责道，“我看就是那种见不得人、偷偷摸摸的家伙！”你试图缓和情况，但这个令人畏惧的统治者毫不掩饰地讥笑你。“不要和皇后辩解！在我的非生日这天，我的馅饼被偷之后，你就这么刚好突然冒出来，还想宣称这是巧合？！鬼话连篇！砍掉你的头！”她气冲冲地离去，一边还咆哮著要见血，而她的随从士兵们只是阻挡你离开。在一阵困惑的沉默中，你等待了片刻，但没有人要带你去行刑。要不这是司空见惯的情况，要不就是刽子手不怎么有干劲。\n"
"柴郡猫再次出现在你身边，看著皇后和她的士兵离开。“真是令人头痛。”牠咕哝著说，“在这紧要关头来到这里，你可真幸运。皇后对她的馅饼的热情，就如同她热爱砍别人的头一样。”猫说到一个断点，牠的头飘离牠的身体。“我想他们很快就会举行一场审判，但如果我是你，我不会想看到我的名字出现在任何名单上的前几位。皇后审判庭玩的叫做怪罪游戏，你最好赶快学会。我对你可充满信心。你肩膀上这脑袋很好……至少目前是。”牠咧著大大的笑容再次消失了，留下你，而你最好得弄清楚该如何从刽子手的斧头中拯救你的脖子。"

"\"A perfectly simple case!\" the King of Hearts declares, banging his gavel.  He looks to the jurors who all nod enthusiastically and hold up chalkboards with \"guilty\" scrawled on them, most with a variety of spelling errors.  \"No evidence or witnesses to speak of!  Never has a verdict been reached more swiftly, I dare say!  Guilty on all charges, off-\"\n"
"\"-WITH YOUR HEAD!\" the Queen shouts over the King to finish the phrase.  Your protests are drowned out by the continued shouting of the Queen and the cheering of the crowds, who all eagerly await the pending sentence.  The card guards haul you out of the courtroom toward a bloody chopping block in an open courtyard.  The executioner stands beside it, running his thumb over the blade of his axe to test its sharpness.  \"Not to worry, I'm a professional.\" he assures you in a surprisingly pleasant tone, \"Just one quick chop and that'll be the end of it.  You won't feel a thing.\""

"“这是一起非常简单的案件！”红心国王敲下木槌宣判道。他看向陪审团，他们都踊跃地点头，举起写著“有罪”的黑板，其中大半都有各种拼写错误。“没有任何证据或证人！我敢说，没有比这更快速的判决了！所有指控都有罪，砍——”\n"
"“——掉你的头！”皇后向国王大喊，替他完成这句话。你的抗议被皇后不断的喊叫声和人群的欢呼声淹没了，他们都热切地等待著判决。扑克牌守卫把你拖出法庭，拖往一个空旷庭院里的血淋淋的枕木。刽子手站在旁边，用拇指划过斧头，测试它的锋利度。“别担心，我是专业的。”他用一种令人惊讶的愉快语气向你保证，“只要快速砍一刀就结束了。你不会有什么感觉的。”"

"You've managed to convince the Queen's courtiers and guards that you couldn't possibly be the thief, at least long enough for you to make your escape.  Back in the heart-shaped woods now, you put your back to the door in the tree and collapse to the ground.  The disorganized chaos of the rest of Wonderland is almost a relief compared to the nonsensical bureaucracy of the Queen of Hearts.  You rest for a short while before standing slowly, using the tree to brace yourself.  Before you can finish standing, however, you are violently thrown to the ground as something slams against the opposite side of the door.  You scramble back from the door in time to see it ripped from its hinges by a shadowy claw.\n"
"Through the open portal, you can see that the Queen's castle has devolved into pandemonium as shadowy monsters claw it apart rapidly.  The ornate palace and gardens crumble and scatter as the creatures rampage in their pursuit of victims.  The shrieks and wails of the courtiers and guards are only outmatched by the fierce and violent cries of the Queen of Hearts herself.  She may have been a match for the shadows on her own terms, but as Gurathnaka's minions consume her court and palace, they grow too much even for the bloodthirsty royal to overcome.\n"
"You continue your escape before you risk death a second time, fleeing back into the surrounding woods before the shadows can overtake you.  The enraged echoes of the Queen's voice reach you long after you lose sight of the glade, but they are finally and suddenly stifled, and a stark stillness falls over the forest.  You steady your nerves and continue through the woods, checking over your shoulder periodically."

"你成功地说服了皇后的侍臣和守卫，你不可能是小偷，至少拖延了够长的时间，足够你逃跑了。现在你逃回到心形的树林里，你的背靠在树干上的门，接著倒在地上。与红心皇后荒谬的官僚作风相比，仙境其他地方杂乱无章的混乱要轻松得多。你休息了一会儿，然后扶著树慢慢站起来。然而，在你还没完全站定前，你就被猛烈地撞到在地，有东西从门的另一侧猛烈地撞击。你及时从门口爬开，看到门被一只阴暗的爪子从铰链上撕裂。\n"
"透过被撕开的门，你可以看到皇后的城堡已经化为一片地狱，暗影般怪物快速地将其撕毁。随著这些怪物在追逐受害者的过程中到处肆虐，华丽的宫殿和花园崩毁四散。只有红心皇后猛烈的哭喊声能盖过其他侍臣和卫兵的尖叫和哀号声。如果以红心皇后的条件，她可能可以和暗影匹敌，但随著古拉斯纳卡的爪牙吞噬了她的审判庭和宫殿，暗影的力量增长太多，即使嗜血的皇族也无法战胜它们了。\n"
"你在再次面临死亡的危险之前继续逃跑，在暗影追上你之前逃回周围的树林。在林间空地离开你视线很长一段时间后，仍然还听得到皇后愤怒的声音回响著，但最终声音戛然而止，一片完全的死寂笼罩著整个森林。你让自己平静下来，继续穿过树林，不时紧张地东张西望。"

msgid "Your opportunity to attack arrives as the shadows rush out toward the Queen in her overemotional state.  You strike at the dark creatures, expecting the Knave to join you, but he stands and stares at the Queen, taken completely aback.  The Queen has seized her executioner's axe and is focusing her anger toward destroying the advancing shadows.  You slow your own assault and eventually stop to join in the Knave's staring as the Queen slices the dark minions to ribbons, screaming for blood and murder all the while.  It feels like barely any time has passed before every last shadow in the Queen's palace has either fallen to her furious assault, or retreated away from the castle.  Neither you nor the Knave had predicted this outcome at all, but it certainly was effective."
msgstr "当暗影冲向过度情绪化的皇后时，你攻击的机会来了。你向黑暗生物攻击，期待杰克会一起加入，但他只是站在那边盯著皇后，完全陷入震惊。皇后拿起了刽子手的斧头，将她的愤怒集中在摧毁进犯的暗影上。你放慢自己的攻击，最后停下来和杰克一起旁观，皇后将黑暗的爪牙切成丝，一边还不停尖叫著要血流成河。你感觉几乎没有经过多少时间，皇后宫殿里的每个影子要不落入她的猛烈攻击，要不就撤离城堡了。你和杰克都没有预料到这个结果，但确实很有效果。"

msgid "Even after brutally dispatching the shadows, the Queen's anger isn't satisfied yet.  She marches toward you with fire still burning in her eyes and the executioner's axe still in hand.  Someone is going to die for what she just went through, and you are still at the top of her list.  You look to the Knave and he looks to you, his eyes narrowing.  Is he prepared to sell you out to save his own head?  Are you prepared to do the same?  You have little time to think the dilemma over before the Queen cuts you short."
msgstr "即使在残暴地驱逐了暗影后，皇后的愤怒仍然没有得到宣泄。她朝你走过来，眼神里仍冒著熊熊烈火，手上还拿著刽子手的斧头。有人得要为了她刚刚经历的事付出生命的代价，而你仍然在她的名单上的首位。你看向杰克，他也看著你，眼睛瞇了起来。他会出卖你来保全自己的脑袋吗？而你会做同样的事情吗？在皇后砍你之前，你只有一点点时间思考这个困境。"

"Even with death looming, you have to admit that owe the destruction of the shadows largely to the Knave and his plan.  Before he can speak, you vouch for the Knave and try to calm the Queen, but unfortunately she's beyond reason.  She swings wildly at you both, and you scatter while she screams for her guards.  You flee through the palace, wondering how you might escape her clutches, when the Knave pulls you into the hedges.  He leads you down a circuitous route that avoids the guard patrols and gradually winds its way to the door in the tree.\n"
"\"I don't suppose you'd mind if I tagged along for the time being?\" the Knave asks you with a hint of uncertainty in his voice, \"I won't be welcome in the court anymore by any means, and… I really must admit, I didn't expect any sort of loyalty from you.  The least I can do is return it.\"  One surprise deserves another as you've gained an unlikely ally in the scheming nobleman, though you're relieved for it to be a beneficial surprise this time."

"即使面临死亡的威胁，你也不得不承认，摧毁暗影很大程度上要归功于杰克和他的计划。在他说话之前，你为杰克担保，并试著让皇后平静下来，但不幸的是，她听不下去。她向著你们疯狂地挥舞著斧头，当她尖叫著呼唤守卫时，你们连忙分头逃跑。你逃离了宫殿，正盘算著如何才能逃脱她的魔掌时，杰克把你拉进树篱里。他带领你沿著一条迂回的路线避开守卫巡逻，并逐渐绕道到了树干上的门。\n"
"“我想你应该不会介意我暂时跟著你吧？”杰克的声音里带著一丝不确定，“无论如何，我在审判庭上可不会受到欢迎，而且……我真的必须承认，我没想到你对我会有任何的忠诚。至少我得做点回报。”一个意外接著一个，你竟然在狡诈的贵族中获得了一个难得的盟友，这次你很高兴它是一个好的意外。"

msgid "The Queen's attention snaps to the Knave at your quick accusation.  The nobleman's nerve fails him as he tries to deflect blame back at you while the Queen advances.  He finally tries to flee, but too late as the axe swings.  In one clean motion, the Knave's head launches from his shoulder and rolls to a stop several yards away.  You try to slip away as well, but the sudden arrival of a battalion of card guards hems you in close to the Queen.  Tense seconds pass, but finally the Queen turns to you with a pleasant expression on her face, in contrast to the blood on her hands and dress.  \"You've done me quite a service in finding the thief and saving us the trouble of a trial!  And such service deserves a reward!  Seeing as my executioner has been lax in his duties, I hereby award you the rank and responsibilities of royal executioner instead.\"  She shoves the axe into your hands and strides demurely away, leaving you disturbed, but alive."
msgstr "在你快速的指控下，皇后的注意力迅速转移到杰克身上。这位贵族试图将怪罪转移回到你身上，但随著皇后的逼近，他失去了勇气。他最终试图逃跑，但为时已晚，斧头已经挥下。干净的一刀下去，杰克的头就从他的肩膀上飞出来，滚到几码外停了下来。你也试著溜走，但突然到来的一队扑克牌守卫将你包围在皇后的身边。过了紧张的几秒钟后，终于皇后以和善的表情转向你，与她手上和衣服上的鲜血形成强烈的对比。“你为我找到了小偷，省去了审判的麻烦！这样的贡献值得奖励！鉴于我的刽子手失职，我特此授予你军衔以及皇家刽子手的职务。”她将斧头塞到你的手中，端庄地大步离开，留下不安的你，但至少还活著。"

"Even after the shadows have been chopped to bits, the Queen keeps up her furious attacks, dicing them into yet finer bits while screaming about her tarts.  You and the Knave wait until the Queen has worn herself out before you dare approach her.  She whirls around to meet you, but her expression has lifted to a smile.  \"Vermin of some sort, I might have guessed that they would steal my lovely tarts!\"  The Knave quickly affirms her false suspicion and you nod in agreement, not wanting to provoke the Queen any further.  \"If only I wasn't forced to dispose of them myself.  I require a new executioner!\"  The Queen's eyes settle on you at once and she shoves the axe into your hands.  \"You will do, my congratulations.\"  She marches off, calling for the fresh batch of tarts on the double as she goes.\n"
"The Knave pulls you aside as soon as the Queen is out of sight.  \"I hadn't expected success on that scale, or… any scale, really.  I had intended to take my leave as soon as the shadows had been drawn out, but you really did complicate things, for the better, I must say.  All of this is I suppose to say… I do owe you quite a bit.  If I can assist you - within reason, of course - then I shall be eag- erm, willing to do so.\"  Within reason, he says.  There's none of that to be had in Wonderland, but you'll have plenty of use for the Knave's underhanded talents all the same."

"即使暗影已被切成碎片，皇后仍然继续她猛烈的攻击，将它们切得更细碎，一边还尖叫著关于她的馅饼。等到皇后精疲力竭，你和杰克才敢接近她。她转过身来面对你，但表情已经变成了微笑。“只是某种害虫，我大概有猜到就是它们偷走我可爱的馅饼！”杰克马上对她错误的怀疑连番称是，你也点头表示同意，不想再激怒皇后了。“真希望我不用被迫自己处理它们。我需要一个新的刽子手！”皇后的目光立刻落在了你身上，她把斧头塞到了你的手中。“你来做吧，恭喜你了。”她大步离开，边走边喊著要双份新出炉的馅饼。\n"
"皇后一离开视线，杰克就把你拉到一边。“我没想到会以这种方式成功，或者……任何方式，老实说。我本来打算等暗影被引诱出来就逃走，你确实把事情变复杂了，但我必须说，是往好的方向。我想说的就是这些……我确实欠你不少。如果我能帮上你的忙——当然是在合理的范围内——那么我会很高……呃，愿意去做。”他说合理范围，在仙境中可没有这回事。但你还是可以好好利用杰克偷鸡摸狗的才能。"
