"The shadows have kept you on edge for too long already in your journey.  Even in an open field where the sun beams down on you from above, you scan the horizon in constant search for any sign of approaching darkness.  Have the shadows been curbed at all by your efforts, or are they unstoppable while their master prepares to feast on Arkham?  The questions tax your psyche further as you continue your trek through Wonderland.\n"
"Your vigilance finally pays off as you spot an airborne figure moving toward you at great speed.  You brace for a fight, but it wheels up high above you, circling like a vulture around a dying animal.  You remain still on the sunny field, dreading what the strange entity might be all the while.  Tense moments pass before the figure descends in a surprising burst of speed and lands in the tall grass before you.  The strange beast before you is equally split between eagle and lion: a gryphon in the flesh if ever there was one, and it regards you curiously as it settles its wings.\n"
"\"Another visitor to Wonderland?  How very peculiar!\"  It leans uncomfortably close to you and strokes the underside of its beak with one claw pensively.  \"You've chosen a poor time for sight-seeing, I'm sorry to say.  The stability of the place has been lacking, and those shadowy beasts have been gnawing about like termites!\"  Your relief at meeting a more congenial resident of Wonderland is quickly replaced by your unease at the Gryphon's statements.  The Gryphon takes note of your concern and nods sagely.  \"Curious to see the trouble yourself?  My, but you're a morbid sort, but it just might take such a sort to sort through it all!\"  The Gryphon chuckles and puffs up a bit at his own play on words, reveling for a moment before turning his side to you.  \"Come, come, don't shy away now!  The only way to see the state of things is from the air!\"  Again you find yourself with conflicting feelings.  On the one hand, this could help you gather information easily, and even assist in your travels.  On the other hand, however, being hundreds of feet up in the air on the back of one of Wonderland's capricious creatures could prove fatal.  Your curiosity wins out in the end, however, and you climb onto the Gryphon's back gingerly."

"在你的旅程中，暗影已经让你精神紧绷太久了。即使在空旷的田野中，阳光从上方照射在你身上，你也不断地监视著地平线，寻找任何黑暗接近的迹象。你的努力是否已经能够抑制了暗影，或是它们是否势不可挡，而它们的主人正准备在阿卡姆享用大餐？你继续穿越仙境时，这些怀疑进一步加重了你心理的负担。\n"
"你的警觉终于发挥作用，你发现一个飞行的身影以极快的速度向你接近。你做好战斗准备，但牠在你上方高高地盘旋，就像秃鹰围绕著垂死的动物一样。你在阳光明媚的田野上一动不动，害怕著这奇怪的东西是什么。紧张的时间不断流逝，直到这个身影以惊人的速度下降并降落在你面前的高高的草上。你面前这头奇怪的野兽一半像老鹰，一半像狮子：是一只活生生的狮鹫，如果狮鹫存在的话。牠一边收起翅膀，一边好奇地打量著你。\n"
"“另一个仙境的访客？多么奇特啊！”牠令你不自在地靠向你，用一只爪子若有所思地摸著牠的喙底。“你来观光的时间选的不好，我很遗憾，最近这里的稳定性很差，那些暗影般的野兽四处啃咬，像白蚁一样！”遇到一位友善的仙境居民的宽慰感很快就被狮鹫的陈述带来的不安所取代。狮鹫注意到你的忧虑，聪慧地点点头。“想亲自看看这些麻烦吗？天啊，你真是个对不好的事感兴趣的人，但也许就是需要这种才能才能解决这种事！”狮鹫因自己的用词重复而咯咯地笑了笑，身躯稍微蓬松，陶醉了片刻，然后转向你。“来来来，现在别害羞了！只有从空中才能看到事情的状态！”你再次发现自己陷入了矛盾之中。一方面，这可以帮助你轻松收集信息，甚至帮助你的旅行。另一方面，骑在仙境中一个善变的生物背上，离地数百英尺高，可能是一件致命的事。然而，你的好奇心最终胜出，你小心翼翼地爬上狮鹫的背。"

"\"Satisfied?\" the Gryphon probes, \"The view is much less dismal from the ground.\"  You consider the state of Wonderland and the shadows once more briefly before you nod.  At once, the Gryphon wheels back down to earth, swooping this time toward a quiet lagoon on the edge of a vast body of water.  \"Come, I know just the thing to liven your spirits after such a sight!  My friend the Mock Turtle is quite a songster, to say nothing of his education!\"  You try to envision just what a mock turtle might look like, but the creature the Gryphon lands next to doesn't match any of your ideas.  The Mock Turtle resembles a sea turtle but with the head of a cow.  He sits at the water's edge, staring down into the pools with a smile on his face, but tears leaking from his eyes.  \"Ahoy and what ho!\" the Gryphon calls out, \"enjoying the dance?\"\n"
"\"It's a sight for sore feet,\" the Mock Turtle murmurs with a nod.  You give the creature a hesitant hello and he waves a flipper at you without looking.  His attention is firmly fixed on the waves in front of him.  You stand beside the Mock Turtle and look into the water, seeing at once a bizarre spectacle.  Sea creatures of a hundred varieties dance together in a complicated but stately fashion just under the water's surface.  The Mock Turtle splashes his flippers in the surf in time with the muffled music, still sniffling but enjoying himself.\n"
"Not wanting to ask the Mock Turtle bluntly, you take the Gryphon aside and quietly question why the creature is in such an emotional state.  \"The poor fellow knows the state of Wonderland as well as I do,\" the Gryphon responds with a pitying glance at its friend, \"he often used to cry in his spare time, but now that he's found something serious to give him sorrow, he's doing all he can to distract himself.\"  The Mock Turtle hums to himself as the dancing continues, utterly enthralled.  \"It's for the best, don't you know!\" the Gryphon chuckles, \"no sense dwelling on such grim matters\"\n"
"You frown at the Gryphon's statement.  Sitting by idly is only going to help Gurathnaka in its conquest.  You warn the two creatures of the dangers the hungry shadows could pose if left unchecked.  The Mock Turtle covers his ears with two flippers and shakes his head, while the Gryphon scowls at your stories.  \"Such topics aren't polite, not one jot!\" the Gryphon scolds you.  The Mock Turtle nods with a whimper and chimes in after.  \"There's so much misery to be had, only let us ration it!  Let us sing of soup and schools, and join the lobsters in their quadrille!\""

"“怎么样？”狮鹫试探道，“从地面看，景色远远没有那么绝望。”你再次短暂地思考关于暗影和仙境的状态，然后点点头。狮鹫立即转向返回地面，这一次向著开阔水域边缘的一个安静的潟湖俯冲过去。“来吧，看过这样郁闷的景象后，我知道什么能让你打起精神！我的朋友假海龟很会唱歌，更别提他的教养了！”你试著想像假海龟会长什么样子，但在狮鹫降落地点旁边的生物与你的想像大相迳庭。假海龟大致像一只海龟，但长著牛的头。他坐在水边，低头看著水池，脸上带著微笑，但眼泪却从眼眶里流了出来。“啊哈，如何唷！”狮鹫喊道，“舞蹈看得开心吗？”\n"
"“看起来脚会酸痛。”假海龟点点头低声说。你犹豫地打了个招呼，他对你挥著脚蹼但没看向你。他的注意力牢牢集中在面前的海浪上。你站在假海龟旁边，看著水中，立刻看到了奇异的景象。上百种海洋生物在水面下以一种复杂而庄严的方式一同跳舞。假海龟随著低沉的音乐节奏在海浪中拍打著脚蹼，仍然抽著鼻子，但享受沉浸于其中。\n"
"你不想太直白地问假海龟，于是你把狮鹫拉到一边，悄声地询问为什么这个生物会处于这种情绪状态。“这个可怜的家伙和我一样知道仙境的状态，”狮鹫回应道，用怜悯的目光看著他的朋友，“他平常没事的时候就很爱哭，但现在有真正严重的事情让他难过，所以就他就想尽办法分散自己的注意力。”随著舞蹈继续，假海龟自顾自地哼唱著，完全沉迷在其中。“这样最好，你不知道吗！”狮鹫轻笑道，“没道理去想那些可怕的事情！”\n"
"你对狮鹫的叙述表示不满。袖手旁观只会助长古拉斯纳卡的侵略。你警告这两个生物，如果不加以控制，饥饿的暗影会造成什么危险。假海龟用两只脚蹼摀住耳朵摇了摇头，而狮鹫则对你的故事皱起眉头。“这种话题很没礼貌，完全没有！”狮鹫骂道。假海龟呜咽著点点头，然后开始唱道。“有这么多的痛苦，就让我们定量吧！让我们歌颂汤和学校，加入龙虾的方块舞！”"

"The task of opposing Gurathnaka is too important for you to allow this apathy.  You go to great lengths to explain the threat of the shadows, ignoring their protests.  You spare no detail in the power, the relentlessness, and the wanton destruction the shadows are capable of.  The Gryphon brushes off each grim retelling, and the Mock Turtle shakes his head woefully, trying not to listen.  It is only when you begin talking about Arkham's destruction that the conversation seems to affect them.\n"
"You describe the chaos and madness that engulfed the city when last you saw it.  Each place and person you once held dear will be lost forever if you can't find a way to root Gurathnaka out of Alice's dreams.  The Mock Turtle bursts into a fresh cascade of tears while the Gryphon draws upward indignantly.  \"That is quite enough!\" he bellows, \"the poor fellow has delicate sensibilities, you know!  And now that you've-\"\n"
"\"No…\" the Mock Turtle blubbers, placing a flipper between the two of you, \"what's made me sad is that… is that I've been so intolerably selfish… we both have…\" the Gryphon's beak opens in shock and he stumbles over his words, but can't voice any protest to the statement.  \"To think that such sorrow was inside you… we simply must help.\"  The Gryphon regains his composure quickly, and though he still looks irritated at being made to look callous, he nods with a grumbling agreement."

"对抗古拉斯纳卡的任务对你来说太重要了，你不能接受这种漠不关心的态度。你竭尽全力解释暗影的威胁，无视他们的抗议。你巨细靡遗地描述暗影的力量、无情和肆意破坏的能力。狮鹫对每次重复的严酷话语都置若罔闻，假海龟则悲哀地摇摇头，尽量不去听。当你开始谈论阿卡姆的毁灭时，才打动了他们。\n"
"你描述了当你最后离开阿卡姆时吞没这座城市的混乱和疯狂。如果你无法找到将古拉斯纳卡从爱丽丝梦境中根除的方法，你曾经珍视的每个地方和每个人都将永远消逝。假海龟泪流满面，而狮鹫则愤愤不平地抬起头。“真是够了！”他吼道，“这个可怜的家伙感情很纤细，你知道的！现在你——”\n"
"“不……”假海龟哭著说道，把脚蹼拦在你们两个中间，“我难过的是……是我太自私了……我们俩都是……”狮鹫的喙因震惊而张开，他结结巴巴，无法提出任何反驳。“没想到你内心对此感到悲伤……我们必须提供帮助。”狮鹫很快恢复了镇定，尽管他看起来还是对于被迫装出冷酷无情的样子感到恼怒，但他点点头表示同意。"

"\"There's no need to be impertinent!\" the Gryphon snaps as it shelters the Mock Turtle under one wing, \"if you don't enjoy the ways that we handle our affairs, then you're welcome to exclude yourself from them!\"  The two delusional creatures return to watching the strange dance in the surf, refusing to acknowledging you any further.  With a resigned sigh, you turn away to rediscover the path, when you notice the daylight around you beginning to dim.\n"
"Wisps of shadow creep along the ground toward the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, seeping inside them like water to a sponge.  You back away cautiously, hoping that they will continue to ignore you even as the shadows begin to corrupt them.  The tears that drip down the Mock Turtle's face darken until he cries dark liquid rivulets, while the Gryphon swells in size to match its overflowing pride.  Not wanting to risk another attack, you make a swift retreat from the darkening scene.\n"
"Your steps are suddenly halted as you feel a tug at your back, as if you had been leashed.  You look down and discover that your shadow stretches far behind you, as if tethered to the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle.  They turn to you, the one with a predatory eye and the other with trickling darkness on his.  \"You musn't go…\" the Mock Turtle moans with a distorted tone.  \"There is only sorrow out there… come and sit…\" the Gryphon echoes hollowly.  You struggle forward desperately as you feel yourself being reeled back toward them, until at last you jerk forward with a snap.  With the tether gone, you waste no time in making your escape."

"“没必要无礼！”狮鹫将假海龟藏在一只翅膀下，厉声喝道。“如果你不喜欢我们处理自己事情的方式，那么你可以不要多管闲事！”这两个幻想生物回去观赏海浪中奇怪的舞蹈，不想再理会你。你注意到周围的日光开始变得黯淡，无奈地叹了口气，转身重新寻找方向。\n"
"一缕缕影子沿著地面爬向狮鹫和假海龟，渗入他们体内，如同水渗入海绵般。你小心翼翼地后退，希望即使暗影开始腐蚀他们，也能继续忽略你。假海龟脸上滴下的泪水变黑，他哭出的泪水形成黑色的小溪；而狮鹫的身躯膨胀，和牠的刚愎自用相符。你不想冒再次被攻击的风险，迅速撤离了这个黑暗的景象。\n"
"你突然感觉背后被人拽了一下，好像被拴住了一样，脚步停了下来。你往下看，发现你的影子在你身后长长地延展，彷佛被拴在了狮鹫和假海龟身上。牠们转向你，一个眼神中充满侵略性，另一个眼神中带著一丝丝黑暗。“你别走……”假海龟用扭曲的语气呻吟道。“外面只有悲伤……来这边坐下……”狮鹫空洞地附和。你感到自己被卷向牠们，拼命地向前挣扎，直到最后向前猛扑，发出断裂声。栓索消失，你毫不犹豫立即逃走。"

"You feel more than a little drained from dealing with the two hodgepodge creatures as you set back on the journey through Wonderland.  You try to orient yourself from what you recall of the landscape from the back of the Gryphon, but it's all somehow wrong.  Once again, Wonderland seems to be shifting to keep you out - or at this point, in.\n"
"As you stare about the jumbled countryside, a single feather drifts into view, much like one from the Gryphon's own coat.  You look up to see hundreds of feathers floating on the breeze, slowly shifting into a long line that winds through the trees and over the rolling hills.  You have a feeling that you have Alice to thank once again for helping you navigate this madcap world.\n"
"You march forward, following the feather trail while it lasts, but your thoughts drift backward to the view from the Gryphon's back.  The balance between Wonderland's stability and Gurathnaka's advance is more precarious than you first imagined.  Questions and fears mix in your mind with each step forward.  Will the discoveries and insights you've gained be enough to beat back the shadows from Arkham?  Has Arkham already been reduced to irreversible ruin?  Or will you even be able to escape from Wonderland back into the real world at all?  Each question returns you the same answer: you won't know until you've tried.  With everything else in Wonderland so uncertain, the one thing you have to trust is your own decisions, come what may.  You press on, for better or worse, braced for the consequences."

"当你盯著被搅乱的田园时，一根羽毛飘入视野中，看起来与狮鹫的身上的羽毛一样。你抬头，看到数百根羽毛随风飘扬，慢慢变成一条长长的线，蜿蜒穿过树木，越过连绵起伏的山丘。你感觉到你得再次感谢爱丽丝的帮助，在这个疯狂的世界指引你方向。\n"
"你继续前进，在羽毛散去前沿著踪迹走，但你的思绪飘回到狮鹫背上的景色。仙境的稳定和古拉斯纳卡的侵犯之间的平衡比你最初想像的更加岌岌可危。你向前迈出的每一步，脑海中都混杂著疑问和恐惧。你的发现和见解是否足以击退阿卡姆的暗影？阿卡姆是否已经沦为不可逆转的废墟了？或甚至你还能从仙境回到现实世界吗？每个问题的答案都相同：你不去试，就不会知道。仙境中的其他一切都如此不确定，因此无论发生什么，你必须相信自己的决定。是好是坏你都得坚持下去，并准备好承受后果。"
