"The winding paths through the rolling hills remind you of Miskatonic Valley in a way.  You might feel at ease, were it not for the glimpses of strange creatures and wisps of shadows each time you look back over your shoulder.\n"
"Your worries are compounded as the landscape smooths out to tidy fields in perfect squares.  Immaculate hedge rows and canals line each plot of land.  The grass of each alternates between darker and lighter shades to contrast with its neighbors.  The parallel with a chess board occurs to you at the same moment that you catch sight of several enormous white chess pieces, alive as any person and grouped together fearfully.  The pieces regard your approach warily and hold themselves proudly until a distant creaking and cracking sends them back to shuddering timidly.\n"
"A massive storm of shadows looms several fields beyond your own, churning but stationary.  \"It is a travesty, is it not?\"  You turn to find the White King staring grimly at the fearsome event alongside you.  \"To think we once fought with such chivalry according to the Rules of Battle with the red army.\"  You press the king on his comments, and he realizes rather suddenly that you are not a native of Wonderland.\n"
"\"You are perhaps another visitor from Alice's domain?  You have impeccable timing.  Completely wrong, but impeccable.  My own army has lost its nerve completely, and I am in need of new pawns.  Strong and keen, brave and true.\"  The King looks to you and stares in uncomfortable silence with a disappointed look stamped on his face.  \"You will have to do.\"  You attempt to protest being drafted, but the White King snorts impudently.  \"Hush hush, it's an honor to serve a king, you know!  All you must do is travel to the eighth square and capture the Red King.  Defeat the Red Queen as well, if you are able.  You will of course meet with some opposition, but I'm confident - no, confident is the wrong word.  Optimistic?  Satisfied?  Yes, that will do - satisfied that you will find success.\"\n"
"Irritation builds within you at the White King's haughtiness, but you consider the situation carefully.  You entered Wonderland to seek out and destroy Gurathnaka's shadows, and such a target is now within your sight.  With any luck, you might even be able to convince some of the other white chess pieces to assist you in stamping out this corruption.  With some resignation, you accept the White King's badgering and proceed to the edge of his defenses.  The Cheshire Cat grins down at you from the battlements, lounging lazily but eyes fixed on the distant shadows permeating the far side of the chess board."

"蜿蜒曲折的小路穿过连绵起伏的丘陵，某方面让你联想到米斯卡塔尼克山谷。如果不是每次回头时都能瞥见奇怪的生物和一缕缕暗影，你可能会更放松自在。\n"
"随著景观逐渐平缓，形成完美正方形的整齐田野，你的忧虑加深了。完美的一排排树篱和运河形成每块土地的界线。每个区域草丛的明暗度深浅交错，与邻近区域形成对比。当你意识到这就像是西洋棋盘的同时，你看到几颗巨大的白色棋子，像人一样活生生的，他们害怕地聚集在一起。这些棋子们骄傲地站著，警惕地看著你靠近，直到远处的嘎吱声和碎裂声让他们再次胆怯地颤抖。\n"
"一个巨大的暗影风暴笼罩著距离你的区域几格以外的田野，风暴不断翻搅但没有移动。“这真讽刺，不是吗？”你转身发现白棋国王严肃地盯著你身后的可怕景象。“想想我们曾经以如此的骑士精神，按照战斗规则与红棋军队作战。”你向国王追问他的评论，他突然意识到你不是仙境的居民。\n"
"“你是另一位从爱丽丝的国度来的访客？你来的时机无可挑剔。完全错误，但无可挑剔。我自己的军队已经完全失去了勇气，我需要新的兵卒。强大而敏锐，勇敢而纯粹。”国王看向你，在令人不安的沉默中盯著你，脸上带著失望的表情。“你必须要去。”你试图抗议被征召入伍，但白棋国王粗鲁地哼了一声。“安静，替国王服务是一种荣幸，你知道的！你要做的只有前往第八格，掳获红棋国王。如果可以，也把红棋王后击败。当然，你会遇到一些阻力，但我有信心——不，信心不是正确的词。乐观？满意？对，就是这个——我很满意你会找到方法的。”\n"
"白棋国王的傲慢让你感到恼火，但你仔细考虑了现况。你进入仙境寻找并摧毁古拉斯纳卡的暗影，而这样的目标现在就在你的眼前。运气好的话，你甚至可以说服其他一些白棋子来帮助你拔除这些腐化。你半推半就地接受了白棋国王的纠缠，然后前往防御的前线。柴郡猫从城垛上对著你咧嘴一笑，懒洋洋地躺著，但眼睛却盯著从棋盘远处另一端渗出的暗影。"

You take a moment to catch your breath, and have barely rested a moment when you hear a loud call nearby.  The White Knight approaches on his horse and promptly falls off, but just as quickly stands with a laugh.  \"Ah, what a glorious battle that was, young pawn!  Few are able to keep pace with a queen at all, but you have done so splendidly!  With skill such as yours, why, I dare say you have the makings of a fine knight within you!\"  The knight's lack of perspective is oddly refreshing amid the horrors being wreaked by the shadows, and you give him an appreciative nod."
msgstr "经过几分钟的拖延战，顽强的红棋王后倒在地上，再也无法继续追击你。你花了一点时间喘口气，几乎没有休息到，就听到附近响亮的叫喊声。白棋骑士骑著马接近，立即摔下来，但很快就笑著站了起来。“啊，多么光荣的一战啊，年轻的小卒！很少有人能跟得上女王的步伐，但你却做得如此出色！以你这样的技能，哎呀，我敢说你能成为一个优秀的骑士！”骑士糟糕的洞察力在这片暗影肆虐的恐怖之中奇妙地令人感到振奋，你向他感谢地点了点头。"

msgid "The Red Queen pursues you relentlessly, flanked by dozens of other chess pieces.  The queen's speed is tremendous, constantly cornering you and leaving you no chance for respite.  As the crowd of red chess pieces closes in on you, the White Knight gallops onto the scene once more, and intervenes between you and the shadowy horde.  \"Carry on quickly, my friend,\" he bellows, \"and leave this rabble to me!\"  He charges clumsily at the advancing line in a show of hopeless heroics, but he has given you much-needed time to focus on your task.  You turn away from the carnage and work as quickly as you can."
msgstr "红棋王后无情地追著你，还有几十个其它的棋子一起包抄。女王的速度十分惊人，不断逼近你，让你没有喘息的机会。当红色棋子们向你靠近，白棋骑士再次飞驰到现场，并挡在你和一大群暗影棋子之间。“快点，我的朋友，”他咆哮道，“这群乌合之众就交给我！”他笨拙地冲向行进的队伍，表现出无可救药的英雄气概，但他替你争取了你急需的时间来专注在任务上。你从惨烈的景象中转身，尽快地完成任务。"

"You abandon the prospect of victory against the Red King and flee the chess board fields.  The landscape tears as you flee, ripped apart by the sudden surge of shadows while the red pieces rush forward to finish the defenders.  It seems as if you may be overwhelmed as well, but the shifting landscape opens up a gap in the orderly hedge rows.  You dive through without hesitation and hunker down as the land around you shudders in destruction.\n"
"Minutes pass, and finally the wild din fades, replaced again by an eerie silence.  You emerge from the hedges to find the entire battlefield now marred and blasted by the dark surge.  Bodies of defeated chess pieces lie strewn about the fields, most of them cracked and contorted from whatever force ripped them apart.  You glance in the direction of the Red King's castle to see it as you first did: a red shard in a dark vortex.  Slowly you make your way back towards the ruined defenses of the White King to search for survivors.\n"
"Scattered stone and derelict pillars are all that remain of the white castle you first set out from.  Many of the missing chunks of masonry look as though they were bitten or clawed apart rather than shattered.  The trail of destruction leads directly to the throne of the White King.  You find his body on the steps to his throne, shredded to unrecognizable state but for the crown he once wore.  You realize now just how deeply the shadows have divided Wonderland.  The two sides may have once met in combat honorably, as the white pieces expected to fight, but Gurathnaka's corruption transformed the red pieces into remorseless monsters that share its hunger.  You depart solemnly to recuperate and find a new battlefield to face the shadows upon."

"你放弃了战胜红棋国王的希望，逃离了棋盘领域。当你逃离时，地形被突然涌现的暗影撕裂，同时红色的棋子们冲上前去了结防守方。你几乎也将要被卷入其中，但不断移动的地形在整齐的几排树篱中形成了一个缺口。你毫不犹豫地跳进去蹲著，四周的土地因毁灭而剧烈震动。\n"
"几分钟过去了，狂野的嘈杂声终于消失了，取而代之的是诡异的寂静。你从树篱中出来，发现整个战场都被黑暗浪潮破坏和炸毁了。被击败的棋子尸体散落在田野上，其中大部分都被某种力量撕扯而破裂、扭曲。你朝红棋国王城堡的方向瞥了一眼，就像你初次看到的那样：黑暗漩涡中的红色碎片。你慢慢地回到白棋国王防线的废墟，寻找幸存者。\n"
"你最初出发的白色城堡整个只剩下散落的石块和破败的柱子。许多缺失的石块看起来像是被咬开或被爪子抓开而不是破碎。毁坏的痕迹直接通往白棋国王的王座。你在通往王座的台阶上发现他的尸体，除了他曾经戴过的王冠外，他的尸体被撕碎成无法辨认的状态。在这一刻你意识到暗阴将仙境的分裂得多深。棋子双方可能曾经光荣地在战场上相遇，就如同白棋期望般的对决，但古拉斯纳卡的腐蚀将红棋变成了无情的怪物来分担它的饥饿。你严肃地离开，疗养休息，然后继续寻找下一个面对暗影的新战场。"

"You approach the fallen Red King cautiously.  The shadows have ceased to flow out of him, but you're not about to take extra risks if you can help it.  Moments pass without event, and gradually the sound of the Red King's labored breathing magnifies.  You turn him over and are astonished to find that despite his injuries, the king is asleep!  You open the Red King's eyes manually, only to find them filled with swirling darkness.  Whatever shadowy power has possessed the king is keeping him alive even in this state.  You ponder the possibilities and it soon becomes clear to you what has happened.  Gurathnaka is an eater of dreams, and even the denizens of a dream can have dreams of their own.  The Red King's dreams sustain the shadows as they try to consume both Wonderland and Arkham.  You grimace with pity as you deliver the merciful killing blow to the Red King.\n"
"As the death blow lands, the shadows retreat from the castle with an echoing shriek.  The remaining red chess pieces, however, turn to retire without any sound or expression.  Perhaps some core principle drives them to obey the rules of chess even when controlled by Gurathnaka's shadows.  Whatever the reason, you're relieved that you won't have to fight your way back out of the castle.\n"
"You return wearily across the battlefield to the opposing castle of the White King, who meets you proudly.  \"A fine victory, just fine!  I knew I was right to put my confidence - no, wait, it was satisfaction - satisfaction in you!  Come now, we must feast and revel before we go to gloat of our victory to the Red King!\"  You say nothing, not wanting to sour the mood and possibly upset the White King.  If there's one thing you've learned, it's that the inhabitants of Wonderland are notoriously short-tempered.  You give a noncommittal answer and let the king return to his celebration as you quietly depart."

"你小心翼翼地接近倒下的红棋国王。暗影已不再从他身上冒出，但如果能避免的话，你不打算冒额外的风险。时间一分一秒地过去，什么事都没发生，渐渐地，红棋国王沉重的呼吸声变大了。你把他翻过来，惊讶地发现尽管国王受伤了，他却睡著了！你用手张开红棋国王的眼睛，发现眼睛里充满了旋转的黑暗。即使在这种状态下，令国王著魔的暗影力量仍维持著他的生命。你思考著各种可能性，很快你就想到了原因。古拉斯纳卡是梦境的吞噬者，而即使是仙境的居民也拥有自己的梦境。在暗影试图吞噬仙境和阿卡姆时，红棋国王的梦境维持著暗影。你的表情因怜悯而扭曲，挥出攻击将红棋国王毫无痛苦地杀死。\n"
"随著致命一击落下，暗影在回荡的尖叫声中从城堡里撤退。而剩下的红棋棋子无声无息地转身退下。也许即使被古拉斯纳卡的影子控制，某些核心的原则仍驱使著他们遵守西洋棋规则。不管什么原因，能不费力气地从城堡里逃出来，让你松了一口气。\n"
"你疲惫地穿过战场回到对面的白棋国王的城堡，他骄傲地接见了你。“一场很好的胜利，非常好！我知道我是对的，把信心——不，等等，是满意——对你满意！来吧，在我们向红棋国王吹嘘我们的胜利之前，我们必须大肆庆祝！”你什么都没说，不想坏了白棋国王的心情，甚至可能会惹恼他。如果你学到了什么教训，那就是仙境的居民是出名的脾气暴躁。你不置可否地回应，然后趁著国王忙著他的庆祝活动时悄悄地离开。"
