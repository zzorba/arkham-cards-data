"The forest around you grows darker and more tangled with each step.  It reminds you of the witch-haunted woods on the outskirts of Arkham in several respects.  Each echoing sound might be some eerie creature stalking your steps, or another of Gurathnaka's shadows hungering for your essence.  Your worries escalate as the clear path you'd been following dead-ends in a bramble patch.  You scan the tangle for any sign of a way through or around, but without any promise.  Your eyes return to the path you arrived by, only to find that the forest has swallowed it without any trace.  It's almost as if the woods themselves were actively working to confuse you, like many of Wonderland's other denizens.  Now at a loss for direction, you stumble forward through the rough terrain as long as the fading light allows.  Each passing moment gradually amplifies your fear of being ambushed out from the darkness.  You press on until finally, at the foot of a gnarled tree, you make a campfire from the fallen branches to wait out the night.\n"
"Not an hour into your rest, you are awoken by the clanging of a bell and the clamor of nearby voices.  You rouse yourself from sleep and find that your campfire is somehow missing, though a purring chuckle directs your attention above your head.  The Cheshire Cat holds the burning logs in two paws, waving them like signal lanterns.  Noticing that you've awoken, the cat grins and sets the fire back down before disappearing once more.  A crowd of ten figures rushes eagerly into the clearing around the tree, only to stop with groans and sighs.  \"Tisn't a Snark at all!\" a proud looking man cries, waving his bell for attention.  \"Though Snarks are handy for striking a light, this one's been lit by someone or other.\"  The hunters seat themselves around your fire with several shows of exhaustion.  \"At least it wasn't a Boojum…\" a man with a baker's hat mutters as he wipes the sweat from his brow thankfully.\n"
"\"We'd all have vanished away were that the case!\" the Bellman retorts, seating himself beside you.  He looks you over for a moment as if just noticing you and stands once more.  \"By chance, would you also be hunting a Snark?\"  You shake your head and explain that you've gotten lost in the woods here.  \"What luck, we're lost as well!\" he exclaims with a smile, \"but a Snark's the cure for that!  A Snark is useful for a great many things, and finding one's way surely might be one of them.  You're quite welcome to join our search… pending your profession.\"  You look to the hunters and see a banker, a butcher, a beaver, and others all with jobs beginning with \"b.\"  You think for a moment and tell the Bellman that you could be considered a bodyguard, and he leads his fellows in a cheer.  \"Just what we chiefly need!  We'll find the Snark in no time at all now!  The Tulgey Wood may be dense as a dunce and thicker than thieves, but we'll find the Snark in spite of it!\""

"你周围的森林随著你的每个脚步变得更黑暗、更纠缠。它在某方面让你想起了阿卡姆郊区那个女巫出没的树林。每次响起的声音都可能是某种怪异的生物在跟踪你的足迹，或是另一个古拉斯纳卡的影子在渴求你的精华。你沿著小路走，当路径在一丛荆棘中来到尽头时，你的忧虑加深了。你环视四周纠缠在一起的树林，寻找任何能穿过或绕过的方法，但一无所获。你将目光转回到你来的路径上，却发现森林已经将它吞噬得无影无踪。这就像是树林本身正在主动迷惑你，如同仙境的许多其他居民一样。现在你迷失了方向，你在崎岖的地形中仅靠著昏暗的光线蹒跚前行。在黑暗中被伏击的恐惧随著时间逐渐放大。你勉强继续前进，终于来到一棵长满瘤的树下，你用落下的树枝生起篝火，等待夜晚过去。\n"
"休息不到一个小时，你就被响亮的铃声和附近的喧闹声吵醒了。你从睡梦中醒来，发现你的篝火不知何故不见了，但一阵呼噜呼噜的笑声将你的注意力引到头顶。柴郡猫用两只爪子抓著燃烧的原木，像信号灯一样挥舞著它们。猫注意到你已经醒来，咧嘴一笑，把火放回去，然后再次消失。十个人影急切地冲进了树周遭的空地，然后停下来呻吟和叹息。“根本就不是蛇鲨！”一个看起来很自满的男人喊道，挥舞手中的铃以引起注意。“虽然蛇鲨可以很便利地发光，但这个光源是被其他人或其他东西点亮的。”猎人们坐在你的火堆旁，其中几人已显得疲惫。“至少牠不是布琼姆……”一个戴著面包师帽的男人低声道，他满怀感激地擦了擦额头上的汗水。\n"
"“如果是的话，我们早就都消失了！”摇铃人反驳道，在你旁边坐下。他看了你一会儿，然后就像是刚注意到你，再次站了起来。“你会不会碰巧也在抓蛇鲨？”你摇摇头，解释说你在树林里迷路了。“真幸运，我们也迷路了！”他笑著喊道，“但蛇鲨能解决这个问题！蛇鲨在很多事情上都很有用处，你肯定也能找到自己的使用方式。我们非常欢迎你加入我们的搜索……但你要有个职业。”你看向猎人、然后是银行家、屠夫、海狸和其他人，他们的职业都以“b”开头。你想了一会儿，然后告诉摇铃人你可以当保镖，他带著他的伙伴们一起欢呼。“这正是我们最需要的！我们马上就能找到蛇鲨了！土尔基森林可能比蠢蛋更蠢，比盗贼更贼，尽管如此，我们还是会找到蛇鲨的！”"

Moments pass fearfully until you spot movement out of the corner of your eye.  At first, the form looks like one of the shadows, but as it grows closer, there can be no doubt.  It's a Snark!  You start to call for the hunters when you notice a hint of malice in the creature's eyes.  The Bellman didn't mention anything like this about the Snark.  You rapidly rack your brain until you recall a comment about something called a Boojum.  From what the hunters discussed, it's a creature that resembles a Snark, but should you meet it, you will softly and suddenly vanish away.  You look up and realize too late that it's a Boo-"

msgid "Again and again the horrible Jabberwock swoops in to attack you, and each time you beat the monster back.  The beast drips with a foul ichor from its wounds that grow with each skirmish, and yet it continues its assault without any hesitation.  The Jabberwock grasps at you with a furious howl, and you strike back hard and true.  Your final blow separates the creature's head from its body in a fantastic shower of gore, and the hulking body collapses to the forest floor, twitching and spasming.  You recuperate slowly, put off by the monster's death throes, but still alive with a feeling of victory slowly building inside you.  The nearby members of the expedition look to you with surprise and tell themselves that you could certainly use an extra ration of grog for saving them from the beast."

Try as you might, you simply cannot find a pattern to its attacks nor pin it down for any decent length of time.  The Jabberwock seems to have a particular hatred for the blade that the Bellman uncovered, striking at your sword arm each time it ambushes you.  In desperation to avoid becoming another victim, you throw down the strange sword, and the Jabberwock seizes it at once.  It focuses its attacks on the blade as you flee to a safer distance, only turning around once you hear the snap of shattering metal.  With a roar of triumph, the monster vanishes once more into the night, leaving you to nurse your wounds with the few members of the expedition who survived its fiery wrath."
msgstr "这个邪恶的生物无情地攻击你和森林中的其他猎人。你尽力尝试，但完全无法找到牠的攻击模式，也无法追踪牠足够长的时间。查博芜基龙似乎特别痛恨摇铃人发现的剑，每次伏击时牠都会攻击你握剑的手。你不顾一切地扔掉了奇怪的剑，避免成为另一个受害者，而查博芜基龙立刻抓住了剑。你趁牠攻击那把剑的时候逃到安全的距离，只有在听到金属碎裂的声音时转身看了一次。怪物随著胜利的咆哮声再次消失在夜色中，留下你和其他少数幸存下来的探险队成员替自己疗伤。"

"Regrets fill your mind as you flee the Tulgey Wood.  You're frustrated by fleeing the woods ungracefully, by not catching the Snark, and by even joining the hunt in the first place.  The echoes of the other hunters gradually reaching their own untimely ends reverberates between the trees.  Each short series of shouts and shrieks inevitably ends in a sudden silence.  The distant sound of the Bellman's ringing is the last thing to fade into the night, bringing an end to the disastrous expedition.\n"
"You take only a few steps more before a rushing sound of air builds behind you.  You turn in dread to see a blanket of darkness sweeping over the forest, extinguishing every speck of light in its path.  Not wanting to strain your luck any further, you break into a sprint.  Your own lights flicker and begin to fade as you keep just ahead of the advancing wave.  Step by step you maneuver over the rough terrain, daring not look back again, until a ray of morning sun blinds you suddenly.  You collapse down in confusion and exhaustion, expecting the worst, but the wave of darkness has receded once again."

"你心中满是懊悔地逃离土尔基森林。你为灰头涂脸地逃离森林、没有抓住蛇鲨而感到沮丧，甚至后悔最初加入狩猎。其他猎人逐渐各自遇上他们自己太早到来的结局，声响在树木之间回荡。每次短促的叫喊声和尖叫声都注定倏地沉默下来。远处摇铃人的铃声是最后一个消失在夜色中的东西，为这场灾难性的探险画上了句号。\n"
"你只多走了几步，身后就传来一阵划破空气的急促声响。你恐惧地转身，看到一片黑暗席卷森林，熄灭了路径上的每一个光点。你不想赌运气，拼命往前冲刺。你勉强跑在前进的黑暗浪潮前头，自己的灯火也开始闪烁、褪色。你不敢再回头，一步一步地在崎岖的地形上前进，直到突然有一缕晨光使你感到刺眼。你在困惑和疲惫中倒下，做好了最坏的准备，但黑暗的浪潮再次退去。"

"The Snark looks up at you meekly, almost tamely, as the other hunters gather around to view their prize up close in the fading darkness.  Questions fly and theories puncture each other until the Bellman gathers everyone's attention once more.  \"We have found success, or rather success has found us, given the circumstances!  Three cheers for the Bodyguard who first laid hands on the beast!\"  The hunters cheer and call for a celebratory feast, but with only the Snark available to cook, they agree it would be a terrible waste.\n"
"The Snark in the meantime sits quietly in the center of the group.  The many purported uses for the beast seem beyond its capabilities, but for its ability to lead you safely out of the woods.  The Snark - and you by extension - must know every inch of these woods by now, for all that you covered during the chase.  For minutes at a time, it studies each of the hunters in turn before directing its attention back at you.  The creature is observant, another quality that no doubt helped it stay out of harm's way until recently.  You stare into the Snark's eyes, and you lock for several seconds before it speaks to you in perfect English.  \"I've been told it's rude to stare.\""

"其他猎人在消散的黑暗中聚集在一起，近距离观察他们的战利品，而蛇鲨安静地抬头看著你，近乎温驯。问题此起彼落，各种理论互相驳斥，直到摇铃人再次集中了所有人的注意力。“我们得到了成功，或者说，照目前的情况，成功得到了我们！为率先找到猎物的保镖欢呼三声！”猎人们欢呼并喊著要举行庆祝的宴会，但可以拿来煮的只有蛇鲨，大家都同意这将是一种可怕的浪费。\n"
"与此同时，蛇鲨静静地坐在众人中间。这只野兽许多据称的用途似乎过誉了，但牠的确有能力带领你安全地走出森林。蛇鲨——还有你——现在已对这些树林瞭若指掌，因为你在猎捕过程中已学习到许多。牠轮流花几分钟研究每个猎人，然后将注意力再次转回你身上。这种生物很敏锐，这种特性无疑地帮助牠远离伤害，直到被你抓住。你盯著蛇鲨的眼睛看了好几秒钟，然后牠用纯正的英语对你开口说话。“有人说盯著别人看是不礼貌的。”"

Finally, only the Bellman remains standing next to you.  \"Through all the months and weeks of hunting, it never occurred what might proceed the finding of the Snark.

"在你能回应或利用蛇鲨之前，摇铃人从讨论中回来了，他一只手拿著瓶子，另一只手拿著他的铃。他把铃拿给你喝，然后摇著瓶子，好像在敲铃。你婉拒了。“在我们庆祝完抓到蛇鲨之后，我会再找时间奖励你的勤奋。”他说道。你劝摇铃人在离开愈发黑暗的森林后，再举行所有的庆祝。“有道理，”摇铃人沉思道，“如果这次冒险的队长不是我，你的确能做个好队长。现在蛇鲨的第一个用途应该就是你的职责和荣誉！”他把猎人们集合在你和这个生物周围，期待地看著你们。你要求蛇鲨带你们离开土尔基森林，如果牠做得到。牠点头、耸肩、抽搐、旋转，然后突然——\n"
