"The incident was at first assumed to be a case of fatigue and paranoia.  A traveling Englishwoman by the name of Alice Liddell collapsed screaming as the train arrived at Arkham's Northside station.  Other passengers tried to console her, but Ms. Liddell was in a state of sheer panic.  \"The man dressed in newspaper… the goat and the beetle… you saw them too, didn't you?\" she plead to the onlookers, but they only shook their heads in bewilderment.  \"It's still following me, after all this distance… how far will be far enough?!\"  The young woman's panic quickly mounted, and the passengers called for the conductor to escort her off the train.  She begged them not to keep her, that she must continue her journey immediately, but her protests were ignored.  Who could believe such a preposterous story?  You yourself might have doubted her too had you not also seen these strange figures that Alice described in the brief moment before she collapsed.\n"
"You depart the train as soon as possible, but find no trace of Ms. Liddell on the platform.  Porters tell you that the police got involved and decided to take her to Arkham Asylum for temporary care.  You wrinkle your nose at the prospect of the infamous sanitarium doing her any sort of good.  Whatever Alice saw on the train must have existed, however briefly, and you must speak with her to find out what it was and why it fills her with such a powerful dread.  You head home to prepare to have an in-depth talk with Ms. Liddell.\n"
"Arkham has long been plagued by the weird, ghoulish, and arcane.  It may not have been as big a shock to you as it might have been to others, but the fact that a foreigner was affected immediately upon arriving in Arkham strikes you especially oddly.  As you gather your things at home, your mind runs over the hundreds of possible evils that could be haunting Ms. Liddell, each less pleasant than the last.  You pocket some weapons and extra materials on the offchance that you'll have to confront anything sinister.\n"
"Your own house lies across the city from the asylum, giving you plenty of time to speculate as you trek over to Arkham's downtown district.  You hope that it's just your eyes playing on your fears, but the city seems darker than it should be for a summer afternoon."

"这起事件起初被认为是由于疲劳和妄想症引起的。一位名叫爱丽丝·利德尔的英国女性乘客在火车到达阿卡姆北区的车站时尖叫著倒下了。其他乘客试著安抚她，但利德尔女士处在极度恐慌的状态。“穿著报纸的男人……山羊还有甲虫……你也看到了吗？”她向围观的人寻求帮助，但他们只是疑惑地摇头。“它还在跟著我，都这么远了……要多远才够？！”这位年轻女子的恐慌迅速加剧，于是乘客们找来乘务员护送她下车。她哀求他们不要阻拦她，她必须立即继续她的旅程，但她的抗议无效。谁会相信如此荒谬的故事？如果不是在爱丽丝在倒下前的短暂瞬间，你也看到了她描述的那些奇怪的角色，你自己也不会相信她。\n"
"你尽快地下了火车，但在月台上却找不到利德尔女士的踪迹。搬运工告诉你，警察介入并决定带她到阿卡姆疯人院临时安置照护。一想到臭名昭著的疗养院能为她带来什么帮助，你就皱起了鼻子。不管爱丽丝在火车上看到什么，尽管很短暂，但一定是真实存在的。你必须与她谈谈，以了解那是什么，还有为什么会让她感到如此强烈的恐惧。你回到家里，做好与利德尔女士进行深入交谈的准备。\n"
"一直以来，阿卡姆常受到怪异、食尸鬼和神秘事件的侵扰。也许对你来说，这些对你的冲击不像对其他人那么强烈，但是一个外国人一到阿卡姆就立即受到影响这件事，让你感到特别奇怪。当你在家里收拾东西时，你的脑海里浮现出数百种可能会影响利德尔女士的邪恶，一种比一种更加地另人感到不安。你带了一些武器和额外的道具，以防万一你得面对什么险恶的东西。\n"
"你的房子与疯人院之间隔著一整个城市，因此当你穿越阿卡姆市中心的商业区时，你有足够的时间可以进行推演。这座城市似乎比平常的夏日午后还更加阴暗，你希望这只是你的恐惧导致你的眼睛的错觉。"
