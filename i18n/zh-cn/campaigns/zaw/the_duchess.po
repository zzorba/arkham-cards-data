"It's a rare enough event to find any sort of hospitality in the vast expanse of Wonderland, so the sudden appearance of an English country manor gives you definite pause.  You advance quickly to the manor and shout a greeting to the two figures seated outside the main door.  Both are dressed in the fine uniforms of aristocratic servants, albeit one is a frog and one is a fish.  They glance at you lazily but do not rise from their seats, only sighing wistfully.\n"
"An awful commotion sounds dully through the door, although the two footmen seem not to hear it.  \"If you've more messages, you'll simply have to wait,\" the frog footman croaks at you, \"we've been waiting for weeks and we still can't get in.\"  You ask if the door is locked.  \"No,\" the fish footman burbles, \"but it's a footman's job to let people in, and if we're not inside, well…\"  The two footmen sigh a second time and go back to staring up at the sky dumbly.  You give the footmen a nominal thanks and open the door for yourself.\n"
"The inside of the manor is utterly chaotic.  Toppled furniture and display pieces litter the floors, and the wallpaper has been shredded systematically.  Each step brings you closer to the source of the noise, which you can only guess is a monster of some kind by the shrieking, clanging and scrambling you hear emitting from the kitchen.  Determined not to be caught by another of Wonderland's surprises, you ready yourself for a fight before you enter.\n"
"You burst through the kitchen door just in time to dodge a thrown piece of crockery.  A woman in the regal attire of a duchess stands beside her cook, both of them staring down an enormous shadowy boar, but both also looking more annoyed than frightened.  The Duchess scolds the monster severely and hurls pots and pans while her Cook does the bulk of the fighting with any utensils at hand.\n"
"\"You'll catch a beating yet!\" the Duchess shrieks as she grabs for more dishes.  The Cook hurls a butcher's cleaver at the boar, who swats it out of the air with a feral cry.  \"Pepper!  The air must be thick with pepper!\" the brutish noblewoman clangs two ladles together as she calls again and again for pepper.  The Cook staves off the monster with a carving knife as she joins in the calls for pepper.  As you prepare to take action, you spy a lone pepper grinder sitting atop the counter next to you."

"能在广阔的仙境中受到任何形式的招待是一件很难得的事，因此当一座英式乡村庄园突然出现，你毫不犹豫就停了下来。你快步走向庄园，向坐在大门外的两个身影打了个招呼。他们两个都穿著贵族仆人的精美制服，但一个是青蛙，一个是鱼。他们懒洋洋地看了你一眼，没有站起来，只是惆怅地叹了口气。\n"
"门的另一边传来一阵可怕的骚动，但两个仆人似乎没有听到。“如果你也是来传讯的，你有得等了。”蛙脸仆人对你啯啯地说道，“我们已经等了好几个星期了，仍然无法进去。”你问他们门是不是锁著。“没有。”鱼脸仆人汩汩地说道，“不过让人进门是仆人的工作，如果我们不在里面，那……”两个仆人再次叹了口气，继续看著天空发呆。你随口谢过了仆人，然后自己打开了门。\n"
"庄园里一片混乱。倒塌的家具和陈列品散落在地板上，墙纸也被有系统地撕碎了。你每走一步就更接近噪音的来源，通过你听到的厨房里传出的尖叫声、叮当声和争吵声，你只能猜测牠是某种怪物。你不想再被仙境的惊喜趁你不备，于是在进去之前做好了战斗准备。\n"
"你猛地冲进厨房的门，正好躲开一块飞过去的陶片。一位身著华丽服饰的公爵夫人站在她的厨子旁边，两人都盯著一头巨大的暗影野猪，但他们看起来比较像是恼怒而不是害怕。公爵夫人严厉地咒骂怪物，拿锅碗瓢盆扔过去，而她的厨师用手边的各种厨具负责进行大部分的战斗。\n"
"“迟早打中你！”公爵夫人尖叫著抓起更多的盘子。厨师向野猪扔了一把屠夫的大菜刀，野猪发出一声野蛮的叫声，将刀子从空中拍了下来。“胡椒！我们得在空气中洒满胡椒！”粗鲁的贵妇人拿著两个勺子互相敲打，不断地要求将胡椒送过来。当她忙著催讨胡椒时，厨师用一把切肉刀挡开了怪物。正当你准备采取行动时，你注意到你旁边的柜台上有一个胡椒研磨器。"

"You grab the pepper grinder, half-questioning your own actions and half-assuring yourself that Wonderland has its own bizarre logic, even if you can't make heads or tails of it.  The handle whirls around easily, grinding the peppercorns and sending out a cloud of spice far denser than you expected.  Seconds later, the entire kitchen is blanketed with pepper.  You hold your nose, but the sneezes escape you all the same.  The shadowy boar joins you in wild sneezing while the Duchess and Cook, who are completely unaffected, cheer, still hurling dishes at the beast.  You can't make out a thing, but you can tell that the sneezes of the beast are growing more and more frenzied, until a single mighty expulsion clears the room of pepper, along with a fading shadow creature.\n"
"In the spot where the monster once stood, a baby with pig-like features lies in a bundle of cloth.  It wails loudly, still sneezing as the Duchess prances over to pick him back up.  \"There!  That will teach you to throw a tantrum just to annoy us!\"  You lower your weapons and scratch the back of your head in confusion, but the Duchess is completely delighted and the Cook has returned to preparing some unappealing soup.  \"Come now, sing with us, dear!  Speak roughly to your little boy, and beat him when he sneezes…\""

"你拿起胡椒研磨器，一方面怀疑自己的行为，一方面又觉得仙境有自己的诡异逻辑，即使是你也无法理解。手柄转起来很轻松，胡椒粒被磨碎，冒出一团香料云，比你预期的更稠密。几秒钟后，整个厨房都被胡椒粉覆盖了。你摀住鼻子，但还是一样狂打喷嚏。暗影般的野猪也和你一样狂打喷嚏，而公爵夫人和厨师则完全不受影响，他们欢呼雀跃，继续向野兽扔盘子。你什么都看不清，但你知道怪物打的喷嚏越来越狂暴，直到一个特大喷嚏把房间里的胡椒粉都清除，连同暗影生物也一起消失了。\n"
"在怪物原本站立的地方，躺著一个长得像猪一样的婴儿，裹在一卷布里面。他大声地哭，当公爵夫人跳过去把他抱起来时，他还在打喷嚏。“好了！这下你知道别只为了惹我们生气而发脾气了！”你放下武器，疑惑地抓了抓后脑勺，但公爵夫人非常高兴，厨师则回去继续准备一些看起来不怎么好喝的汤。“来吧，和我们一起唱歌，亲爱的！对你的小孩子要粗声粗气，只要他一打喷嚏就揍他……”"

"Your own means have carried you through the trials of Alice's dreams so far, and you see no reason to doubt your own abilities now.  You advance on the beast and combat it on your terms.  The screams from the Duchess and the Cook reach a deafening pitch, but you continue the fight in spite of them.  For minutes you probe and strike, wearing down the monster's energy gradually.  At last, the shadowy pig shrieks in panic and leaps out the kitchen window to escape your assault.\n"
"You turn back to the Duchess and her Cook, expecting a tiny bit of gratitude only to see them both frothing with fury and eyes wide with malice.  \"Brute!  Callous wretch!\" the Duchess bellows, gritting her teeth, \"you've savaged my boyish pig!  My piggish boy!\"  You can barely form a response as the two pelt you with any dishes and utensils they can reach.  From what little the Duchess and her Cook say coherently, you realize that the boar monster was once the Duchess' son, and was somehow transformed into the frightening creature you just drove away.  No explanation you give placates the crazed duo in the slightest.  You beat a hasty retreat to the relative safety of the manor's hallway as you dodge the debris.  The shouts and wails of the two madwomen echo after you, though neither makes any attempt to follow you out."

"到目前为止，你已经靠自己的方法度过了爱丽丝梦境中的各种考验，现在没有理由再怀疑自己的能力。你上前，按你的方法与怪兽战斗。公爵夫人和厨师的尖叫声震耳欲聋，但你忽略他们继续战斗。在几分钟之中你试探、攻击，逐渐消耗怪物的体力。最后，那只暗影般的猪惊恐地尖叫著，跳出厨房的窗户以逃出你的攻击。\n"
"你转身面对公爵夫人和她的厨师，本以为会受到一点感激，结果却看到他们俩都怒火中烧，眼里充满了恶意。“畜生！冷酷无情的坏蛋！”公爵夫人咬著牙吼道，“你把我的孩子猪给蹂躏了！我的猪孩子！”你完全无法做出回应，因为他们用手边能拿到的任何盘子和器具丢向你。从公爵夫人和她的厨师的只言片语里，你意识到野猪怪物曾经是公爵夫人的儿子，而且不知何故变成了你刚刚赶走的可怕生物。你怎么解释都无法安抚这两个疯狂的人。你一边躲避残片，一边匆忙地撤退到相对安全的庄园走廊。两个疯女人的哭声和喊声在你身后回荡，但他们都没有试图追上你。"

"You exit the Duchess' manor to find the two footmen exactly where you left them.  They look to you with the same dull expressions as before.  \"Got what you came for?\" the frog footman asks drearily.  You're not really sure how to respond, but the fish footman doesn't give you a window to speak.  \"I doubt it,\" he bubbles, \"or else this message wouldn't have arrived.\"  He gestures to an enormous letter leaning up against the courtyard stones with your name written across the envelope.  You wonder for a moment who could possibly know that you would be at the Duchess' manor for such a brief span of time, and the answer soon occurs to you: Alice herself!\n"
"You had hoped that getting help in the form of a letter would have been more direct and clear than the other forms of assistance Alice had given you.  Unfortunately, you find the letter to be a jumbled mess of unrelated words.  Is Alice's ability to contact you really this limited?  You study the paper for several minutes wondering just what the message is trying to convey.  Some of the words you recognize based on your recent experiences, while others hint at challenges and dangers you have yet to brave.  You carefully discount the out of place words until the remaining ones begin to make sense as directions.  You double and triple check the letter, doubting your ability to make sense of this weirdness, but ultimately set off again through Wonderland if for no other reason than to leave the chaotic manor behind you."

"你离开公爵夫人的庄园，在与先前同样的地方又遇到两个仆人。他们看著你，表情和之前一样呆滞。“完成你来的目的了吗？”蛙脸仆人百般无聊地问道。你不确定该怎么回答，但鱼脸仆人没给你说话的机会。“我觉得没有。”他冒著泡泡说道，“否则这封信就不会送来了。”他指了靠在院子石头上的一封巨大的信，信封上写著你的名字。你好奇了一会儿，谁能在这么短的时间内知道你在公爵夫人的庄园，然后很快就想到了答案：爱丽丝自己！\n"
"比起爱丽丝给你的其他形式的帮助，你原本期待收到信能获得的帮助会更直接、更清楚。不幸的是，你发现信里是一堆混乱不相关的字句。爱丽丝与你联系的能力真的如此受限吗？你研究了几分钟的信纸，想知道它试图传达什么信息。你根据最近的经历认出其中一些字，其他地方则暗示了你尚未面对的挑战和危险。你小心地剔除不适合的字，直到你开始能读懂剩下句子里的指示。你再三检查了这封信，虽然不确定你理解这种怪异的能力是否可靠，但最终还是再次出发穿越仙境，就算没别的理由，你也想离开这混乱的庄园。"
