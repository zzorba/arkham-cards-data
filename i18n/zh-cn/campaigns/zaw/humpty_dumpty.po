"Another obstacle blocks your passage through Wonderland, this time in the form of a vast brick wall.  It stretches towards the horizon in either direction, making you doubt if a way around it exists.  Climbing doesn't seem to be an option either, as it stands at the height of a house without any possible footholds.  Exasperated, you begin walking its length in hopes of finding any kind of door or passage through.\n"
"Some distance down the wall, you spot a rotund figure perched atop it.  As you draw close, the silhouette of an egg with legs grows clearer.  You doubt your own eyes for a moment, but who else could it possibly be but Humpty Dumpty from the old nursery rhyme?  He sits atop the wall with his eyes closed and his fist on his chin (or at least the part of his body that passes for his chin) in deep thought.  You call up to him, but he hisses down at you.\n"
"\"Don't speak!  Move away!  Or you might bring the end about quicker!\" Humpty spits at you, trying to remain oblivious to you.  You insist in confusion, and finally he looks down at you with a mixture of annoyance and dread.  \"Now you've done it!  I was safe while I was deep in ponderance!\"  You question whether the word means what he thinks, but he shakes his head - or himself, rather.  \"When I use a word, it means precisely what I wish it to mean!  Otherwise, what good would it be?\"  You decide not to press him on that point and ask again about the end he mentioned earlier.\n"
"\"The end, don't you see?  The others may not see it, but surely you can.  I can recognize one of Alice's ilk when I see one, not from Wonderland at all.  You know as well as I that this land is but a dream, and I, drawn from a sad and dismal tale, am doomed to a gravitic fate!\"  You begin to see Humpty's worries.  Sat on a wall, had a great fall, couldn't be put back together again.  You assert that the children's story and his existence are two separate things, but his expression only grows darker.  \"It's no use!  The printed word is my fate, and that's the end of it.  It's simply my means to an end, and always has been.\"  Humpty's stare grows unfocused, and he begins to wobble atop the wall."

"又一个障碍物阻挡了你穿越仙境的路，这次是一堵巨大的砖墙。它两侧都向著地平线延伸，使你怀疑是否有绕过去的方法。攀爬似乎也不可行，因为墙和一栋房子差不多高，也没有任何可能的立足点。你恼怒地开始沿著墙走，希望找到任何类型的门或通道。\n"
"沿著墙走了一段距离后，你看到一个圆圆的身影坐在墙上。当你接近时，它的轮廓变得更加清晰，像是长了腿的蛋。你一时之间怀疑自己的眼睛，但这不就是古老的童谣中的蛋头先生吗？他坐在墙顶，闭著眼睛沉思，拳头放在下巴上(或者至少是他身体对应于下巴的那个部分)。你朝上呼喊他，但他对你发出嘘声。\n"
"“不要讲话！走开！不然你可能会让结局更快到来！”蛋头先生朝你吐口水，试图假装你不存在。你在困惑中继续叫他，终于他低头看著你，眼中混合著恼怒和恐惧。“这下好了！本来我陷在重思的时候，是很安全的！”你问他这个词的意思是不是指他在想的东西，但他摇摇头——或者说是摇摇他的身体。“我用一个字词的时后，它的意思就是我希望它代表的意思！否则，它有什么用？”你决定别在这个点上深究，再次询问他关于之前提到的结局。\n"
"“结局，你不懂吗？其他人可能不懂，但你肯定能。我能认出和爱丽丝同样的人，绝对不是来自仙境。你和我一样清楚，这片土地不过是一个梦境，而我，来自一个悲伤而凄凉的故事，注定要遭受沉重的命运！”你开始理解蛋头先生的忧虑。他坐在墙上，摔了下去，变得支离破碎。你告诉他小孩子的故事和他的存在是两件不同的事情，但他的表情只是变得更阴暗。“没用的！印在纸上的故事就是我的命运，那就是结局。结局就是我的意义，一直都是。”蛋头先生的目光变得涣散，开始在墙上晃来晃去。"

msgid "\"Accept?!\" Humpty scoffs, steadying himself to continue his tirade.  \"Why I've a good mind to come down there and show you precisely why I should accept it!\"  He begins to clamber down the wall, more sliding than climbing and slipping at several points, but he reaches the ground unscathed.  Humpty wags a finger up at you as he continues ranting.  \"Simply don't accept it, what an utterly intangible thought!  What reason should I have to believe that I should survive a fall from up-\" he points up to his former perch and pauses in thought, \"-up there.  Down to… here?\"  Humpty takes a quick stock of his surroundings and kneads the grass beneath his shoes as the truth dawns on him.  \"I'm… vivacious!  Undisturbed!  There was no great fall or failure to repurpose my pieces!\"  He leaps into the air and clicks his heels in joy as you simply stand by and watch, bemused.  Humpty revels for a few moments longer before he grabs your hand and shakes it vigorously.  \"Well met indeed, then!  You've assuredly granted me a new perspective.  Why, I might do a great many other things now that I've regained myself!\"  You tell Humpty to take it easy for a while, not wanting to turn him into a daredevil.  His fate is his own, but an egg's still an egg."
msgstr "“接受？！”蛋头先生嗤之一笑，稳住身体来继续他的长篇大论。“我就好心下去，告诉你我为什么要接受它！”他开始爬下墙壁，大多是用滑的而不是用爬的，溜了好几次，但他毫发无伤地到达了地面。蛋头先生一边朝你挥动手指，一边继续咆哮道。“只要不接受就好，这是一个难以理解的想法！我有什么理由相信我能从坠落中生还，从那边——”他指著他先前坐的地方，停顿了一下，“——上面那边，掉到下面……这边？”蛋头先生迅速审视了一下周围的环境，揉了揉鞋底的草，领悟到事情的真相。“我……还活生生的！很完整！没有大摔落或大失败等著迎接我！”他高兴地跳起来，脚后跟互相撞击，你只是站在一旁困惑地看著。蛋头先生又欢欣鼓舞了一会儿，然后抓住你的手，用力地摇晃。“真是太好了！你无疑地给了我一个全新的观点。哎，现在我已经找回了自我，我可以做很多其他的事情！”你告诉蛋头先生放轻松点，不想让他变得太莽撞。他能自己掌握命运，但蛋仍然是蛋。"

msgid "\"Fussing?!\" Humpty screeches, \"it is factually reasonable to fear doom from this height!  Suppose I wobble further like this!\" he rocks himself from side to side to prove his point, making himself more unsteady as he does so.  \"Or back to forward like so!\"  He tilts out over the wall and back as he further demonstrates his fear.  You try to get Humpty to stop his hyperbole, but he doesn't listen at all.  \"It's vital for the both of us that you understand the peril I could find myself in!  And if you don't believe me, then-\" Humpty stops mid-sentence as he realizes his wild rocking has upset his balance completely.  He claws at the bricks in a moment of panic, but it's too late to stop from careening over the edge.  You try to help break his fall, but his wild earlier motions send him on a strange trajectory.  Humpty's wail of terror ends abruptly as his body crashes onto the ground, shattering like a vase.  You shake your head at the egg's shortsightedness and look over his remains.  It would be an impossible task fitting him back together, and whether or not that would actually revive him is anyone's guess.  There isn't much you can do now but press on and hope that Wonderland's other inhabitants will be more open to reason."
msgstr "“大惊小怪？！”蛋头先生尖叫道，“在这个高度害怕厄运到来是很合理的！假如我像这样更加摇摇晃晃！”他左右摇晃自己以证明自己的论点，使他自己更加不稳。“或者像这样前后摇晃！”他向墙外倾斜，又晃回来，进一步展现他恐惧的事。你试图让蛋头先生停止他夸张的展示，但他根本听不进去。“对于我们俩来说，理解我可能陷入的危险至关重要！如果你不相信我，那么——”蛋头先生意识到他狂野的摇摆完全破坏了他的平衡，话语倏地停止。他惊慌失措地抓著砖块，但已经太迟了，来不及阻止自己翻落墙缘。你试图帮助他减缓跌势，但他之前狂野的动作让他用奇怪的轨迹掉落。蛋头先生恐怖的哭叫声戛然而止，身体倒在地上，像破碎花瓶一样。你为这颗蛋的目光短浅摇了摇头，看著他的残骸。将他重新拼凑起来将是一项不可能完成的任务，而且谁也说不准这是否真的能让他复活。现在你已无能为力，只能继续旅程，希望仙境里的其他居民能够更理性一点。"

"With the matter of Humpty Dumpty behind you, the problem of the wall remains.  The wall might very well be infinite, if Alice's dreams are, and without so much as a tree to use in scaling the wall, you'll have to double back and find another way.  Before you can act, however, the sound of scraping bricks meets your ears.  You scan the wall for the source of the sound, but you can't pinpoint it.  Upon closer inspection, the entire wall seems to be trembling slightly.  A tremendous rumbling begins to sound through the bricks, and you take several steps backward, looking down to either end of the wall.  The top layer of the wall rises like a wave, and a ripple of displaced masonry works down from either end, looking to meet up at your spot.  You leap backward even further as the bricks collide with a crash, and a cloud of powdered mortar obscures your vision.\n"
"The dust settles quickly in the silence of the aftermath, and the wall before you has been cracked at the top, with loose bricks now forming a rough ramp upward.  Once again, you can only attribute such swift and dramatic assistance as Alice's influence on her own dreams, helping to guide you along.  With another obstacle eliminated, you climb the mound of debris and easily pass through the fissure in the brick wall."

"蛋头先生的事已经过去了，但是墙的问题依旧还在。如果爱丽丝的梦境是无限的，那么这堵墙很可能也是无限的，而且没有类似树木之类的可以用来爬墙，你将不得不原路返回寻找别的路。然而，在你采取行动之前，刮砖块的声音就传到了你的耳朵里。你扫视墙壁寻找声音的来源，但无法找到位置。你更仔细查看，整面墙似乎都在微微颤抖。巨大的隆隆声开始透过砖块响起，你向后退了几步，看向墙的两端。墙的表层像波浪一样升起，砖石的错位像涟漪般从两端往你移动，在你的位置相遇。当砖块相撞发出撞击声时，你向后退得更远，一团粉尘遮住了你的视线。\n"
"尘埃在寂静的余波中迅速落下，你面前的墙壁顶部已经裂开，松散的砖块堆形成了一个粗糙的斜坡。你只能再一次将这种迅速且戏剧性的帮助归因于爱丽丝影响了她自己的梦境，帮助引导你前进。障碍再次消除，你爬上瓦砾堆，轻松穿过砖墙的裂缝。"
