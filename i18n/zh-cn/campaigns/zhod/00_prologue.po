"Thursday, July 2nd 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts.\n"
"You wake up with a start in the dead of night. You've just had a strikingly realistic dream, which lingers in your mind. In this dream, you thought you saw a man crouched in a pit, surrounded by huge white apes, like in the legends of the African tribes living in the vast Congolese equatorial forest. The man was about to be attacked by the primates until he reached for an artifact. This movement threw them into panic and halted the attack in its tracks. Despite the confusion, it seemed to you that the ancestral spirits began to scream, calling out to all who could hear them to prevent a great danger.\n"
"Your heart is still pounding from the intensity and urgency of the call. You do not know where these events took place, but you know that terrible events are looming not far from the land where you were born.\n"
"During your childhood, you witnessed inexplicable wonders in remote lands, and later you bonded with shamans and medicine men who introduced you to esoteric rituals. In so doing you embarked on a deeper discovery of a world full of ancient secrets. Since then, you have been convinced of the existence of hidden links between the planes of earthly and spiritual existence.\n"
"So it comes as no surprise when shortly afterwards, you learn that the local representative of a wealthy Belgian company is seeking the assistance of individuals who are familiar with inexplicable phenomena. One of their employees, a Station Chief in the Congo, is reportedly causing major problems, with wild rumors beginning to circulate about him.\n"
"Your intuition tells you this is no coincidence. You make an appointment with the representative to offer your help."

"Thursday, July 2nd 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts.\n"
"For some time now you have had difficulty sleeping because of your restless nights. A strange feeling overcomes you when you emerge from your feverish dreams. In these dreams, someone calls out to you for help, or tries to warn you, you can't tell. Perhaps both. This sensation fades away a few moments after you wake up, but you still have the impression that something unnatural is going on. So you stay alert, and keep an eye out for any strange events that have happened recently.\n"
"After a few days, one of your contacts in Arkham's high society brings you interesting information. The local representative of a wealthy Belgian company is seeking the assistance of individuals who are familiar with inexplicable phenomena. One of their employees, a Station Chief in the Congo, is reportedly causing major problems, with wild rumors beginning to circulate about him.\n"
"The mystery surrounding this case puts your instincts on high alert. You become more and more convinced that there is something unusual going on, and you make an appointment with the representative to offer your help."

"A few days later, you are welcomed into the prestigious offices of Mr. Promise, the representative for the entire East Coast of the United States of the powerful Belgian Natural Resources Exploitation Company. Mr. Promise is visibly relieved to meet someone able to deal with his problem.\n"
"He explains that the Company has several stations in Congo, whose principal business is the exploitation of fossilized ivory. This branch of the Company has generated huge returns and accounts for a large part of the Company's profits. For this reason, the agents sent to the region are carefully selected. A talented and promising young man, Mr. Kurtz was sent to the most distant and profitable station, and up until recently the Company was satisfied with his performance. Kurtz was the best in his field, solely accounting for more than half of the Company's Congolese income. Steamboats regularly made the round trip from the Inner Station to the Central Station and back. All was going smoothly in the best of circumstances.\n"
"Until one day, for some unknown reason, Kurtz abruptly stopped sending his ivory to the Central Station. At first, the Company believed Kurtz to be ill or injured in an accident and sent a rescue mission. The team returned without Kurtz. They explained that they had found him very thin but in fairly good shape, but he simply refused to return with them. He also refused to resume the ivory shipments because he needed them for a \"personal project\".\n"
"Strange rumors began to reach the ears of the Company's managers. Not only was Kurtz blocking shipments of ivory, but his influence was growing among the local tribes, and some even worshipped him as a god. Several attempts to bring him back by force were unsuccessful, both the initial discreet ones and the subsequent more aggressive approaches. The last attempt, led by Captain Fresleven and a group of Swedish mercenaries, ended in the same failure. Only a few men returned from this expedition, wounded or traumatized. From what could be understood of their incoherent speech, they did not even get halfway to the Inner Station before being attacked. The Captain is still missing.\n"
"The entire affair is starting to become embarrassing for the Company, and Mr. Promise concludes his explanation by urging you to help him bring Kurtz back alive, so they can put an end to the rumors, resume their business and call Kurtz to account for his actions.\n"
"You accept this mission and leave on the first ship heading for the Congo."
