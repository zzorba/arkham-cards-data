"During the course of your previous investigations, you have repeatedly faced the horrors of the Mythos. You have learned of conspiracies and dreadful rituals aimed to draw abominable beings into our world. Unspeakable entities, some of which would destroy the whole of humanity. But what if the danger is somewhere else? Lurking deep within us, in the darkest recesses of our souls, there is something biding its time. Will whatever has been hidden in our hearts since the dawn of time spark the beginning of our own destruction? \n"
