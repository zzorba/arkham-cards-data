"<i>Following scenario 2–B, the investigators have finally reached the end of the mysterious stairway…</i>\n"
"The black cat awaits you at the bottom of the stairs, watching your long descent with distant, unblinking eyes. You are about to ask how the cat got there when it cuts you off. “Don’t bother. You wouldn’t understand.” It curls up on the cold stone floor, lounging amid the bleak environment."
msgstr ""
"<i>接著冒险2-B，调查员终于到达了神秘阶梯的尽头……</i>\n"
"黑猫在阶梯底下等待著你的到来，它的眼神冷漠而坚定，看著你一步步地往下走。你正想问一只猫是怎么到这里来的，它打断了你。“不必问了。你不会明白的。”它在冰冷的石质地面上蜷作一团，懒洋洋地躺在这个荒凉的地方。"

msgid "<i>If Randolph did not survive the descent</i> and <i>the black cat has a hunch</i>:"
msgstr "如果<i>伦道夫在下降到地下世界的途中遇难</i>，并且<i>黑猫察觉到了什么</i>："

msgstr "告诉《梦寻秘境》(剧本A)的调查员们，保留冒险日志中<i>黑猫察觉到了什么</i>的记录。"

msgid "“Where’s blondie?” the black cat asks, peering around. You remain silent, in anguish. “Ah. I see.” The cat examines its paw. It doesn’t seem to care that your companion did not survive the descent. “Well, that seems to have resolved itself nicely,” it says to itself cryptically."
msgstr "“那个金发小子在哪？”黑猫四处张望著问道。悲痛的你一言不发。“啊。我明白了。”猫看著自己的爪子说道。它似乎并不关心你同伴的安全。“嗯，看来问题自己解决了。”它神秘兮兮地自言自语。"

msgid "In both Campaign Logs, cross off <i>the black cat has a hunch</i>."
msgstr "在两份冒险日志中，划去<i>黑猫察觉到了什么</i>。"

msgid "“Well, since you clearly don’t need my help, I’ll be off now. Just wanted to check to see if you’re still alive. And look at that! You are. For now. Bye then.” Before you get the chance to reply, the black cat wanders off, its pitch-black fur melding into the darkness of the Underworld."
msgstr "“好吧，因为你显然并不需要我的帮助，我会离开的。但我只想确认下你是不是还活著。看呐！你还活著，至今为止。那再见啦。”你还没来得及应它的话，它就走开了，漆黑的毛色融入了地下世界的黑暗之中。"

msgid "You’ve about had it with this cat’s cryptic half-truths and nonanswers. You rail at the beast. How are you supposed to help when you might as well be stumbling in the dark? The black cat sits up and narrows its gaze. “I did not know if you could be trusted. To be honest, I am still unsure. I have had visions of these events for many, many years now. I know some of what may come to pass, but not everything. You could be the ones who will save all of us…or the fools who herald our doom.” The cat’s justification is convenient, but it does explain how it has known where to find you at every turn. You try to persuade the cat to trust you, but it remains unconvinced. “Tell you what. Beneath the surface of the Sea of Pitch lies a passageway between realms. That is where you need to go to stop this world from merging with yours. Make it there in one piece, and I’ll tell you everything. But first, I have somewhere else to be. Your pals need me, too.”"
msgstr "你已经受够了这只猫说话神神秘秘，半真半假，答非所问。你朝它抱怨：你也是一知半解，那你还怎么帮我们？黑猫坐起身，眯起眼睛：“我当时不知道我是否信得过你。老实说，现在我也不清楚。早在很久很久以前，我就能看到这些事件的幻象。我知道可能会发生的一些事，但不是全部。你或许能拯救我们所有人……但也可能是预示我们末日到来的蠢货。”黑猫的理由像是信手拈来，但确实解释了它为什么每次都知道在哪能找到你。你试图说服它相信你，但你仍然无法取得它的信任。“我来告诉你吧。在漆黑之海的水面以下，有著两界之间的通道。你必须到那儿去，阻止这个世界和你的世界相融。如果你能安然无恙地到达那儿，我会把一切都告诉你。但是，我得先到别的地方去。你的同伴们也需要我。”"
