"You have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. This cyclopean cavern is far from the wondrous lands and fabulous cities described in Virgil Gray’s writings. Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he wouldn’t have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark and barren realm, you are filled with hollow despair—an emptiness that gnaws at your heart and mirrors the bleak landscape all around you. You came here to help your friends, and now your only guide through this realm is gone. What if this was all a horrible mistake?\n"
"You shake these dark thoughts from your mind and focus on the path that lies ahead of you. It’s too late to dwell on what you could have done differently. This is your way forward now. Even if you cannot help your friends, even if you are too late to help Randolph, you have another mission now. Clearly this region of the Dreamlands has something to do with the creatures invading your reality. The answers must lie here. Besides, it’s not like you have much choice anymore.\n"
"You walk to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. This realm is staggeringly vast. In the distance, along the cliffs, you see a walled city, of all things. Among its many towers, a black spire rises so high it must pierce the surface of the Dreamlands. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below, and you can see shapes moving throughout the grey, phosphorescent light. You hope the beings who inhabit this realm are ones you might be able to reason with. You have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

"你终于来到了幻梦境，但这里与你预想的并不一样。眼前这个巨大的洞穴与维吉尔·格雷笔下的奇妙大陆、宏伟城市毫无关联。或许作者从未来到如此遥远的地下，也从未发现潜伏在幻梦境之下的恐怖。你觉得，他如果曾到过这里，一定会把这毛骨悚然的画面编撰成书。随著你深入这片黑暗而贫瘠的地方，你内心充满了空洞的绝望——这空虚的感觉折磨著你的心灵，映照著周围荒凉的景象。你是来这儿帮助你的朋友们的，而你在这里唯一的向导已经不在。你会不会是走错了路，错来到这可怕的地方？\n"
"你将这些黑暗的想法从脑海中挥散，专注于前方的道路。如今再去后悔当初的决定，为时已晚。你只需往前走。即便你没能帮上朋友，没能拯救伦道夫，但现在你有了新的使命。很显然，幻梦境的这个区域和入侵现实世界的生物之间有著某种联系。答案一定就在这里。而且，你也没有别的选择。\n"
"你走到了一个锯齿状的悬崖边缘，俯瞰下方的洞穴国度。那里广阔得叫人吃惊。在远处，你沿著悬崖看去，看到一座被围墙包围著的城市。在城中诸多高塔中，有一座黑色的尖塔向上延伸，像是要刺穿幻梦境的地面。南面是一片连绵的平原，俯瞰著下方的山谷，你可以看到一些身影在灰色的磷光中移动。你希望居住在这个国度的生物能跟你讲讲道理。你心中还有疑问……但至少现在你有了计划。这计划是好是坏，尚未可知。"

"You have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. This cyclopean Underworld is far from the wondrous lands and fabulous cities described in Virgil Gray’s writings. Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he would not have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark, barren realm, you raise your concerns with Randolph. “It is true that we are farther from your companions than we intended, he affirms. “However, if I may offer another sentiment—perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Clearly the Underworld has something to do with the creatures invading our reality. I suggest we investigate further while we have the chance. We can return to the surface of the Dreamlands once we have discovered the truth.”\n"
"You ask Randolph if he has any leads, and he steps to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. “I have been here before,” he says quietly, getting his bearings. “Those walls in the distance belong to the City of Gugs. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below. That plain is where the ghouls live. Perhaps there we can learn more.” You raise your doubts aloud, wondering if such creatures are even capable of peaceful conversation. “They are more intelligent than you think, and could be quite helpful if we convince them to aid us. In fact, there is one I count among my friends, an artist by the name of Richard Pickman. If we are fortunate enough to find him, that might be our best chance.” You still have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

"你终于来到了幻梦境，但这里与你预想的并不一样。眼前这个巨大的地下世界与维吉尔·格雷笔下的奇妙大陆、宏伟城市毫无关联。或许作者从未来到如此遥远的地下，也从未发现潜伏在幻梦境之下的恐怖。你觉得，他如果曾到过这里，一定会把这毛骨悚然的画面编撰成书。你们深入这片黑暗而贫瘠的地方时，你向伦道夫吐露内心的担忧。“确实我们离你的同伴比预想中的要更远一些。”他承认道，“但是，从另一个角度看——或许这未尝不是件好事。很显然，地下世界和入侵现实世界的生物之间有著某种联系。我提议，我们应该抓住这个机会继续调查。我们可以在发现真相之后立即回到幻梦境地面。”\n"
"你问伦道夫他是不是知道些什么，他走到了一个锯齿状的悬崖边缘，俯瞰下方的洞穴国度。“我曾经到过这里。”他静静地说道，一边试图搞清楚自己的方位，“远方的高墙之下是古革巨人之城。南面则是一片连绵的平原，俯瞰著下方的山谷。那片平原是食尸鬼居住的地方。或许我们到那里可以了解更多。”你问出了心中的疑问：“那些生物也能和我们友好交流吗？”“它们比你想象中的更聪明，要是我们能说服它们，它们甚至还能帮上我们的忙。事实上，我有一位名叫理查德·皮克曼的朋友，他是个画家。要是能找到他，我们或许就能十拿九稳。”你心中还有疑问……但至少现在你们有了计划。这计划是好是坏，尚未可知。"

"You brace yourself as another wave of distorted reality crashes into you. This feeling, whatever it is, is growing stronger as time marches on. Someone or something is causing it, but how? Just as you are pondering its meaning, you realize something curious: you aren’t the only one affected. Far from it, in fact; the entirety of the Underworld seems to be changing with each wave of warped energy that flows through the realm. Walls shift, the floor skews, and the dim, phosphorescent light scintillates with a cosmic, otherworldly glow. The ground rumbles as another wave of force rushes through the foundations of the dream world. The rocky surface upon which you stand gives way. You flail in the air, attempting to grab hold of something, anything that you can use to pull yourself up. Your hands wrap around a painted plank of wood. You have no time to question its appearance—survival comes first.\n"
"When you pull yourself up, you realize you are curled up on a park bench, surrounded by a thick fog and the grim, gambrel rooftops of Arkham. There is no ground in front of you. Just an open, endless pit into fathomless depths. The Underworld, perhaps? But how is that possible? Virgil’s cat watches you casually from a tree branch that hangs over the park bench. “It won’t stop,” the black cat tells you. “Not until there is nothing left of your world.” You wonder what you could possibly do in the face of such horror. The cat gazes down into the pit below. “It’s waiting for you.”\n"
"Another rumble. In the distance, you watch with horror as an entire building is sucked into the ground. You think you spot a pedestrian in the distance, but it is no human. If this goes on any longer, your companions won’t have a world to awaken to. You steel yourself, look down into the empty pit, and gulp. “Down you go,” the cat says.\n"
"You fall. The roar of the wind is deafening as it whips by your head. You can’t possibly survive a fall like this, you think. But instead of splattering against a hard, rocky ground, you are caught by a glowing, sinewy web. Panicking, you scramble to a nearby platform made of solid rock. Your refuge is one of many, each suspended in the air and connected by thick webbing. Beyond that is a vast, cosmic space, an infinite darkness that stretches as far as the eye can see."

"你做好准备，随即受到扭曲的现实带来的又一波冲击。不论这感觉是什么，它正随著时间的流逝变得越来越强烈。这种感觉的出现一定有其缘由，但那缘由是什么呢？就在你思考其意义时，你注意到异常：你并不是唯一一个受这感觉影响的人。实际上，其影响远不止于此：整个地下世界彷佛都在随著每一波流经这里的扭曲能量而改变。墙壁移动，地板倾斜，昏暗的磷光闪烁著来自宇宙的诡异光芒。随著梦境世界的大地涌过又一波能量，地面隆隆作响，你脚下的岩石地面开始塌陷。你双手在空中挣扎，试图抓住什么来避免跌落。你紧紧缠抱住一块上了漆的木板。你无暇深究这块木板怎么会出现在这里——活命要紧。\n"
"当你爬起身来，你发现自己在公园的长椅上蜷曲著身体，周围能看到浓雾和阿卡姆令人不快的复折屋顶。你面前没有地面。只有一个无边无际的深坑，通向无底的深渊。或许，这就是“地下世界”？但这怎么可能呢？在长椅上方的一根树枝上，维吉尔的猫漠不关心地看著你：“这一切不会停下。”黑猫对你说，“直到你的世界一无所有。”你想道，面对这般恐怖，你究竟能做些什么。猫盯著下方的深坑。“它在等著你。”\n"
"又是一声巨响。你惊恐地看到远处整幢建筑被吸入地下。你看到远处有个身影在走动，但那并不是人类。如果这种情况再继续下去，整个世界都将不复存在，你的同伴也无从醒来。你下定决心，朝空荡荡的深坑看去，深吸一口气。“下去吧。”黑猫说道。\n"
"于是你纵身跃下。咆哮的风震耳欲聋，迎面吹来像是在抽打著你的头脸。你心想，像这样下坠绝对会要了你的命。但你并未在坚硬的岩石地面上摔成肉酱，而是被一张发光巨网结结实实地接住。你惊慌失措，爬到旁边一个岩石平台上。你所在的平台漂浮在空中，周围还有很多同样的地方，它们之间连接著厚厚的网。在那后面，是广阔的宇宙太空，目之所及是无尽的黑暗。"
