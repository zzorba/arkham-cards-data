"A cat’s low-pitched wail draws your attention to a nearby web. When you arrive, you find the black cat stuck on a patch of particularly sticky web, wriggling back and forth in a vain attempt to free itself. Even with its sharp claws, it seems to be in trouble. You lean over and pull the cat free, and it leaps from your arms to a rocky platform below, the only thing between the cat and an endless void. It hisses for a moment, then stands tall. “Did I ask for your help?” it scolds. “Well, you made it below the Sea of Pitch after all. Now look around you. See all this webbing?” You couldn’t miss it even if you tried; you are surrounded on all sides by webs, treacherous pathways across the aether. “It is a bridge between your world and the Dreamlands. If it is completed, the two will merge. Understand? Unless you want everything to look like that hospital where your friends are sleeping, you have to stop this at all costs. Nothing else matters. <i>Nothing.</i>”"

"一声低沉的猫叫声吸引你望向附近的一张网。你走近时，你发现黑猫被粘在一张黏糊糊的蛛网上，它极力挣扎，却无法挣脱。即使有著锋利的爪子，它似乎也遇上了麻烦。你俯下身，把猫抱了出来，它跳出了你的怀抱，落到下面的一个岩石平台上，那是黑猫与虚空之间唯一存在的东西。它低声咆哮片刻，然后挺直身躯。“我说过要你帮忙了吗？”它骂道，“好吧，你还是来到了漆黑之海底下。看看你周围吧。看到这些网了吗？”即使你不去看，你也无法无视周围的蜘蛛网，它们围成一条通往虚空的险路。“这是你的世界与幻梦境之间的桥梁。如果这条桥梁搭成，两个世界就会融合。明白了吗？如果你不想让整个世界变成那所医院——你昏睡的朋友们所在的医院——你就必须不惜一切代价来阻止此事。没有任何事比这重要。<b>没有</b>。”"

msgid "“Hey, you still have that key?” the black cat asks.

Your other friends need it more than you.”"
msgstr "“嘿，那把钥匙还在你这儿吗？”黑猫问道。你在行囊里翻找一通，把你从无名小屋里找到的钥匙拿给黑猫看。“给我。”它提出要求，并且在你还没来得及抗议之前就跳了起来，把钥匙从你手中叼走，“别这样看著我。你的朋友们比你更需要这个。”"

"The black cat stops talking as it spots Randolph for the first time. It circles around the man a few times, agitated. For his part, Randolph looks uncharacteristically perturbed by the cat’s presence, even taking a step backward as it closes in. “What is the matter? I’ve not harmed any of your kind,” he says matter-of-factly. “Have I done something to offend you?”\n"
"“Your mere existence offends me,” the cat replies with a hiss. It strolls back toward you, keeping a wary eye on Randolph. “I think I know what is going on now. It all makes sense. I know who is interfering with my sight. Do not trust that <i>thing</i>,” it warns, circling to keep an eye on the blond man behind it. “I have to prepare. I’ll return when the time is right.”"

"黑猫一看到伦道夫就立刻安静了下来。它不安地围绕著这个人类男子转了一圈又一圈。至于伦道夫，他看起来对于猫的出现感到异常紧张，甚至在它靠近时退后了脚步。“有什么事吗？我没有伤害过你的同胞。”他坦率地说道，“我做了什么冒犯你的事情吗？”\n"
"“你光是存在就冒犯了我。”黑猫咆哮著回应。它慢慢回到你身边，警惕地盯著伦道夫。“我知道这是怎么回事了。一切都说通了。我知道是谁在干扰我，影响我预见了。别相信那家伙。”它警告道，并且来回踱步，盯著身后的那个金发男子，“我得作好准备。等时机到来，我会回来的。”"

It is probably the thing that trapped them in the Dreamlands to begin with. Why, I have no idea. If you want them to survive, they’re probably going to need my help. You’ll be okay here on your own, right?” The black cat doesn’t wait for an answer; without another word, it leaps into the aether below and vanishes."
msgstr "“……那家伙有著数以千计，甚至可能是无穷的假面。有的人称它为<b>奈亚拉托提普</b>。它擅长操控和欺骗他人，诡计多端。你的朋友们一开始被困在幻梦境，或许就是它的杰作。你要问为什么，我也不知道。如果你希望你的朋友们活命，或许该让我去帮帮他们。你自己待在这儿会没事的，对吧？”黑猫不等你回答，便话也不说地跳进了下方的虚空，消失了踪影。"
