msgid ""
"It has been more than twenty-four hours since your companions fell asleep. Over the course of the past day, your curiosity has slowly turned to concern and then dread. The problems began when one of your friends started to toss and turn violently in their sleep. You snapped to attention and tried to shake them awake, but it was to no avail. You tried everything. Physical contact was no use, and water did nothing but soak their clothes and bed fruitlessly. Even opening their eyelids did not wake them, and in the process, you noticed that their pupils had fully dilated and their eyes were glazed over with a milky-white fog.\n"
"You have no idea what this could mean for your friends. Have they managed to find their way to the land Virgil Gray described in his writings? Or has something more sinister taken root within their minds and bodies? Just to be safe, you decide to take your companions to St. Mary’s Hospital. If something ails them physically, perhaps the doctors there can discern what is wrong. Otherwise, you will simply have to watch over them and hope that they return safely to the waking world.\n"
"St. Mary’s is the only hospital in the town of Arkham, and it is a fixture of its Uptown neighborhood. You explain the situation to Nurse Greenberg, the head nurse at the hospital, who instructs several other nurses to carry your companions into the emergency ward on stretchers. She tells you with a warm, friendly smile that your friends will be examined by Doctor Maheswaran, but other than that, you are left entirely in the dark.\n"
"Hours pass. You hear nothing about the status of your companions. You still have not met with Doctor Maheswaran, and you’re starting to grow impatient. You feel something crawling along your arm, and you instinctively brush it away, then wonder if it was an insect or a figment of your imagination. You begin to question whether bringing your friends here was the right choice after all. Eventually, you decide to take matters into your own hands.\n"
"It is late at night, and the receptionist who instructed you to stay in the waiting room is nowhere to be seen. In fact, there are eerily few people roaming the halls of the hospital. With nobody to stop you, you sneak off into the emergency ward to find your friends. It does not take long for you to find their room. Your companions lie asleep on clean, white cots, their sleep anything but peaceful. They are pale faced and sweaty. One of them tosses and turns in their sleep, their brow furrowed with pain or worry.\n"
"Doctor Maheswaran does not seem surprised by your intrusion. “Shivani Maheswaran,” she introduces herself coldly, without looking up from her clipboard. “You’re the ones who brought them in, right? Before you ask: no, I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life,” she says with a hint of dry impatience. You demand that she tell you everything she knows about their condition and not give you the runaround. With a sigh, she puts her clipboard down and addresses you frankly. “Listen, I may be new to Arkham, but I have seen enough inexplicable maladies in this town to fill entire careers in medicine. I understand why you are concerned. Your friends…” She struggles to find the right words. “They are not simply asleep. It is as if they are hovering somewhere between sleep and unconsciousness, or even death. They are not aware of anything happening around them but appear to be reacting to some kind of internal stimuli.”\n"
"Without hesitation, you ask if they are dreaming. “Dreaming?” Doctor Maheswaran replies. “It is unlikely, though it might account for their mannerisms. Honestly—and I know this is not exactly reassuring— none of this makes any sense to me, medically speaking.”\n"
"Just then, you see a large, hairy spider crawling on the chest of one of your friends. “Well, that is odd.” Doctor Maheswaran brushes the spider off, and several more emerge from the sheets to take its place. You and the doctor both take several steps back out of pure instinct. You hear heavy footsteps in the hallway outside the emergency ward, and then the lights begin to flicker. “Okay…that is more than simply odd. What in the world is going on out there?” Doctor Maheswaran asks anxiously.\n"
"For just a moment, you think you hear one of your sleeping companions whisper something. Are they indeed dreaming? And if so, what does their condition have to do with these strange events?"

"你的同伴们已经沉睡超过24个小时了。在过去的一天里，你的好奇慢慢变成了担忧，进而变成恐惧。一开始让你注意到的是，你的其中一位朋友在睡梦中激烈地辗转反侧。你立马打起精神，试图把他们摇醒，但是他们并没有反应。你试遍了一切法子。怎么碰都不管用，用水也只是弄湿了他们的衣服和床铺，完全弄不醒他们。甚至你扒开他们的眼皮也没法让他们醒来，但这时你发现他们的眼睛已经失去了神采，像是蒙了一层乳白色的浓雾。\n"
"你不知道这对你的朋友们来说意味著什么。他们是不是找到了维吉尔·格雷笔下的那个地方？还是说有某些邪物扎根在他们的精神和肉体里了？为了安全起见，你决定把你的同伴们带到圣玛丽医院。如果问题出在他们的身体，那么或许那里的医生可以诊断出来。如果不是，那你只能看护他们，祈望他们平安回到清醒世界。\n"
"作为阿卡姆镇上的唯一一所医院，圣玛丽医院就坐落在住宅区。你向这所医院的护士长格林伯格说明情况，于是她让几名护士用担架把你的同伴们抬进了急诊病房。她带著友善温暖的笑容对你说，马斯沃伦医生将会为你的朋友们作检查，但除此之外，你像被蒙在鼓里。\n"
"过去了数个小时。你完全不知道你同伴们现在的情况。你还没见到马斯沃伦医生，开始逐渐失去耐心。你感觉到有什么东西在你手臂上爬，你本能地把它赶走，然后你内心开始怀疑，那究竟是昆虫还是你的假想。你开始产生疑问，把朋友们带到这里来究竟是不是正确的选择。最后，你决定自己给这个问题找出答案。\n"
"时间已经很晚了，让你待在候诊室的接待护士已经不见踪影。实际上，只有寥寥数人在医院走廊上游荡，这情景让人感到害怕。你偷偷溜了进去，要到急诊病房寻找你的朋友，路上无人阻拦。没花多少功夫，你就找到了他们在的病房。你的同伴们躺在干净的白色病床上睡著，但他们却睡得一点也不舒坦。他们脸色苍白，大汗淋漓。其中一人在睡梦中翻来覆去，眉头深深皱起，不知是痛苦还是忧心。\n"
"马斯沃伦医生似乎对你的闯入并不惊讶。“席瓦妮·马斯沃伦。”她冷冷地介绍自己，目光没从写字板抬起，“就是你带他们入院的，对吗？我可以直接回答你的问题：我不知道他们得了什么病，我这辈子从没见过这样的病。”她的话语中带著一丝焦躁。你问她关于你同伴的情况她都知道些什么，要她把她知道的一切都告诉你，而不是搪塞你。她叹了口气，放下写字板，坦诚地跟你说：“听著，我或许对阿卡姆不太熟悉，但我在这座镇上见过的疑难杂症多得够我研究上一辈子。我知道你为什么会担心。你的朋友们……”她努力寻找合适的措辞，“他们并不是简单的睡著。他们彷佛徘徊在睡眠与昏迷，甚至死亡之间。他们意识不到周围发生的一切，但似乎会对某种内部刺激产生反应。\n"
"你毫不犹豫地问她，他们是不是在做梦。“做梦？”马斯沃伦医生重复道，“不太可能，但这或许能解释他们的怪异行为。老实说——我知道这并不能让你放心——从医学角度说，这一切我都无法理解。\n"
"就在这时，你看到一只毛茸茸的大蜘蛛正在你一个朋友胸口上爬著。“啊，这倒是奇怪。”马斯沃伦医生赶走了那只蜘蛛，随后又有好几只从床单里冒出，爬到刚才的地方。你和医生本能地后退了几步。你听到急诊病房外的走廊传来沉重的脚步声，然后灯光开始闪烁。“好吧……这可不只是奇怪。外面到底发生什么事了？”马斯沃伦医生焦急地问道。\n"
"有那么一瞬间，你觉得自己听见了一个熟睡中的朋友低声说了些什么。他们真的在作梦吗？如果是，他们的情况和眼前这些怪事有何关联？"

"With panic overtaking your mind and no idea how you can escape, you flee anywhere your feet will take you. Hideous monsters begin to close in around you, and you envision yourself wrapped in webs, waiting to be a spider’s meal. Eventually you come to a dead end: a room covered from floor to ceiling in thick, sticky webs. The skittering of spider legs follows close behind, and you realize you have no hope to escape unless there is a path behind the webs. There is no choice remaining for you. You run headlong into the webs, ripping and tearing at them with the ferocity of a cornered animal. It is tough work, but eventually you see a light behind the webs—perhaps an escape route.\n"
"Once you cross through the webs, you are no longer in the dark, sterile halls of St. Mary’s, but in a narrow, web-covered cavern. You dare not tarry or go back the way you came, so you run through the dark, cramped cave with no idea where it might lead. Glancing through the cobwebs to your left and right, you see not just hard rock, but the glimmering of lights, like a sea of stars looming beyond the silken threads. Eventually, you emerge from another wall of webs, only to find yourself in an alleyway in Arkham’s Merchant District, near the Miskatonic River. You have neither the time nor the desire to analyze this, instead deciding to put as much distance as you can between you and the hospital. The moment you get home, you collapse from exhaustion.\n"

Such paths are usually accessible only to experienced dreamers, and only in sleep.
