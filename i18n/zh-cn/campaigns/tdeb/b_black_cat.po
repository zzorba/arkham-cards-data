"<i>Following scenario 1–B, the investigators are confronted outside St. Mary’s Hospital…</i>\n"
"“…You must be their friends,” the enigmatic voice says from above. To your surprise, the quiet voice belongs not to a person, but to a black cat that lounges lazily across a tree branch hanging over the path outside the hospital. “Oh, pick your jaws up off the ground and listen.” The cat rises and leaps onto the top of a nearby fence, walking along it with the kind of grace only cats possess.\n"
"“It is one of the cats of Earth’s Dreamlands,” Randolph proclaims, his voice tinged with merriment, like he was meeting an old friend for the first time in ages. “How long it has been since I have spoken with one of your kind!”\n"
"The cat’s piercing yellow eyes glare at Randolph for a moment before it returns its gaze to you. “…Sure. In any event, I bear a message from your dreaming friends.”"

"“……你一定就是他们的朋友了。”上方传来那道谜一般的声音。令你惊讶的是，这安静的声音并不属于人类，而属于一只黑猫，它正在医院外面路旁的树枝上懒洋洋地躺著。“噢，把你的下巴从地上捡起来，听我说。”猫站了起来，跳到附近的树篱顶上，以猫咪独有的优雅姿态沿著树篱行走。\n"
"“它来自地球的幻梦境。”伦道夫说明道，他的声音里带著几分欢悦，像是重遇了多年不见的故交，“我好久没和你们说上话了！”\n"
"那只猫敏锐的黄色眼睛盯著伦道夫片刻，随后将目光转回你身上。“……是啊。不过，我是给你那几位睡梦中的朋友们带口信的。”"

You’re the only ones who can destroy the great web. Forget about your companions and descend into the pitch. It’s the only way. I’ll try to keep your friends safe while you fulfill your task. Do you understand?”"
msgstr "“遇上麻烦的不只是你的朋友。”黑猫解释道，“这里酝酿著一个巨大的阴谋，而你的朋友们……唔，我只能说他们现在把全部精力都用在应对自己的难题上了。只有你能打破巨网。忘记同伴，亲自上场吧。除此之外，别无他法。在你完成你的任务之前，我会尽力保护你的朋友们。你听明白了吗？”"

My pet human, Virgil, is one of them. Yes, that Virgil. I see the looks on your faces. They’re also with another dreamer, a man named…hey, wait a minute.” The cat glares suspiciously at Randolph, then yawns. “Huh. You know what? Never mind. I have to check on something.” With that, the cat suddenly departs."
msgstr "黑猫告诉你关于幻梦境的一切，以及你的朋友们即将展开的探索。“你的朋友们在幻梦境里一处安全的地方，跟他们一起的还有另外两个人。其中包括我的宠物维吉尔。我看穿你脸上的表情了，没错，就是那个维吉尔。还有一个入梦者，名叫……啊，慢著。”猫怀疑地盯著伦道夫，然后打了个哈欠，“哈。没什么，别在意。我得确认一些事情。”说完之后，那只猫突然消失了。"

msgid "“So, your pals aren’t looking too good. They wanted me to tell you that they’re in a lot of trouble. They can’t wake up until they fulfill this quest, and it’s not going to be easy. The eye of chaos is watching them. You’ve got your work cut out for you, but you also might be their only hope.” The black cat hops down from the fence and starts to walk away. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d better get back to your friends before they all get themselves killed.”"
msgstr "“所以，你的朋友他们遇上了大麻烦。他们必须完成这次探索，否则就无法醒来，而他们要做的事情绝不轻松。混沌之眼正盯著他们。确实你也有很多事要做，但你可能是他们唯一的希望了。”黑猫跳下篱笆，转身欲离开，“那么，恕我告退，我得赶在你朋友们把自己害死之前回去呢。”"

msgid "“Your friends told me to tell you that they’re fine. In fact, they told me to warn you that you’re the ones in real danger. I’d believe them if I were you. There’s a grand conspiracy at work here, and you’re the only ones who can stop it. The best thing you can do is forge onward, for both your sakes. Don’t worry, I’ll stick around for a while. Someone’s gotta keep you alive.”"

msgid "“Nah, you know what? Forget about it. I’m sure you’ll be fine.” The black cat suddenly leaves without another word."
msgstr "“算了，没什么，不用在意。我相信你们自己搞得定。”黑猫突然就走了，什么都没再说。"
