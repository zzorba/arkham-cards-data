"This is it. The end of all things, and the nighted throne of the being known as Azathoth. You know there is no sense in harming it—if such a thing can even suffer harm—so you set about finding another way to prevent it from waking. You understand now that the spirits you saw in Hangman's Hill were trying to warn you. Trying to drive you away from the same path Keziah led them down so many years ago. Anette's incantation served as this creature's alarm, and so you shall transform it into a lullaby.\n"
"It takes ages for you to find within these vast timeless halls the spirit that knows how to reverse the incantation. And it takes even longer to drag the words from its hollow throat. But together, you speak aloud the rite that ends Keziah's work once and for all. Azathoth slumbers once more, though you know it will not last forever. With your task complete, you turn and face the darkness, summoning your steed. It is time to go home."
