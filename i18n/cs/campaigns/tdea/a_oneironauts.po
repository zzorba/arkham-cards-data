"You open your eyes to the sound of a cat’s shrill caterwauling. You had been drifting off to…well, not sleep, exactly. Despite—or perhaps due to—your dreaming, you have been unable to truly sleep in this realm. When you come to your senses, you spot the source of the wailing: Virgil’s cat, black as the void of space itself, sits several feet away waiting for you to pay attention. “Finally,” it declares, “about time you noticed something outside your own head. Listen, I got something important to tell you.”"

"“Wait, where is my human?” the cat asks, craning its head to look around the deck of your ship. “Didn’t I leave him with you?”\n"
"You explain that Virgil has been taken captive by Corsairs, and the cat replies by licking its paw without much concern. “Oh yeah, that’s right. Okay. I’m on the same page as you now.”"

msgid "You try to shush the black cat, but it ignores you. “Relax. Your captors are all up on deck at the moment.” You ask bitterly why the creature is so cavalier about your capture, and request that it free you. “Nah. Somebody else has that covered, if memory serves,” it replies enigmatically."

msgid "The black cat sees Randolph at the helm of your ship and glares at him suspiciously. You wonder aloud what is wrong. “Normally I like the smell of fish, but this is too fishy. Something is wrong. There are not supposed to be two of him. But my memory is fuzzy…” You thought you were confused before, but now you are truly lost. Two Randolphs? “Yes,” the black cat affirms. “This one, and another in the waking world. That seems off,” the black cat understates the problem. “I think something is trying to interfere. I need to go figure this out.” With that, the cat leaps out of view."

Try not to die.” With that, the black cat leaps out of view."

msgid "The black cat tells you all about the region of the Dreamlands your companions have entered. “The entire surface of the Dreamlands, where you’ve been exploring, covers the Underworld like a beautiful silk dress over decayed skin. You have no reason to go there, which is a good thing, because it is a particularly inhospitable place. You actually might have walked right by one entrance to the Underworld, now that I think about it—back in the Enchanted Woods. There are several other entrances as well: beneath an old monastery in Leng, another in the ruins of Sarkomand…”"
