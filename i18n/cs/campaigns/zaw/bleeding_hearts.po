"Rarely in Wonderland do you see anything uniform or well-ordered, so it strikes you especially strangely when you happen across a grove of trees that have grown inexplicably into heart shapes.  The glade itself is also shaped like a heart, tapering inward toward an especially large tree with a red door embedded in it.  Whoever - or whatever - created this grove may be able to help you in stabilizing Alice's dreams.  You step through the door without delay.\n"
"The other side of the door might as well have been another world, as it leads to a vast garden surrounding an enormous castle.  The same heart patterns adorn each flowerbed and topiary bush, most decorated in a bright red color.  You have only a moment to consider who would be so fixated on hearts before a platoon of strange figures approach you.  The figures look like playing cards in all four suits, but each with heads, hands and feet.  The fact that they brandish spears at you vindictively takes some of the humor out of their appearance.  You raise your hands to diffuse the situation just as the ranks of the cards part.\n"
"Another regal figure walks proudly but aggressively toward you.  From her appearance, and connecting the look of the castle around you, it could only be the Queen of Hearts.  She keeps her jaw tightly clenched as she regards you with suspicion.  After a few moments, she begins to speak in a tone that suggests inner rage.  \"And who are you to intrude upon my castle?!\" she accuses gruffly, \"Just the sort of unseemly type to skulk and thieve!\"  You try to smooth things over with the intimidating monarch, but she scoffs openly at you.  \"Don't contradict a queen!  You appear scant moments after my tarts were stolen away, on my unbirthday, no less, and you try to claim coincidence?!  Rubbish and lies!  Off with your head!\"  She storms away, still bellowing for blood, and her entourage of soldiers merely bars your exit.  You wait for a moment in confused silence as nobody attempts to take you away for execution.  Either this is commonplace, or the executioner isn't a real go-getter.\n"
"The Cheshire Cat appears beside you once more, watching the queen and her soldiers depart.  \"Heady times indeed,\" it purrs, \"and you have the great luck of being here at the crux of it.  The queen does love her tarts so, nearly as much as she loves a good beheading.\"  The cat's head floats away from its body as he speaks to punctuate his statement.  \"They'll have a trial shortly, I should think, but were I you, I wouldn't want my name at the top of any lists.  Blame is the name of the game at the Queen's court, and you would do well to learn it quickly.  But I've every confidence in you.  You've a good head on your shoulders… for now.\"  It vanishes once more with a wide grin, leaving you to figure out how best to save your neck from the headsman's axe."

"\"A perfectly simple case!\" the King of Hearts declares, banging his gavel.  He looks to the jurors who all nod enthusiastically and hold up chalkboards with \"guilty\" scrawled on them, most with a variety of spelling errors.  \"No evidence or witnesses to speak of!  Never has a verdict been reached more swiftly, I dare say!  Guilty on all charges, off-\"\n"
"\"-WITH YOUR HEAD!\" the Queen shouts over the King to finish the phrase.  Your protests are drowned out by the continued shouting of the Queen and the cheering of the crowds, who all eagerly await the pending sentence.  The card guards haul you out of the courtroom toward a bloody chopping block in an open courtyard.  The executioner stands beside it, running his thumb over the blade of his axe to test its sharpness.  \"Not to worry, I'm a professional.\" he assures you in a surprisingly pleasant tone, \"Just one quick chop and that'll be the end of it.  You won't feel a thing.\""

"You've managed to convince the Queen's courtiers and guards that you couldn't possibly be the thief, at least long enough for you to make your escape.  Back in the heart-shaped woods now, you put your back to the door in the tree and collapse to the ground.  The disorganized chaos of the rest of Wonderland is almost a relief compared to the nonsensical bureaucracy of the Queen of Hearts.  You rest for a short while before standing slowly, using the tree to brace yourself.  Before you can finish standing, however, you are violently thrown to the ground as something slams against the opposite side of the door.  You scramble back from the door in time to see it ripped from its hinges by a shadowy claw.\n"
"Through the open portal, you can see that the Queen's castle has devolved into pandemonium as shadowy monsters claw it apart rapidly.  The ornate palace and gardens crumble and scatter as the creatures rampage in their pursuit of victims.  The shrieks and wails of the courtiers and guards are only outmatched by the fierce and violent cries of the Queen of Hearts herself.  She may have been a match for the shadows on her own terms, but as Gurathnaka's minions consume her court and palace, they grow too much even for the bloodthirsty royal to overcome.\n"
"You continue your escape before you risk death a second time, fleeing back into the surrounding woods before the shadows can overtake you.  The enraged echoes of the Queen's voice reach you long after you lose sight of the glade, but they are finally and suddenly stifled, and a stark stillness falls over the forest.  You steady your nerves and continue through the woods, checking over your shoulder periodically."

msgid "Your opportunity to attack arrives as the shadows rush out toward the Queen in her overemotional state.  You strike at the dark creatures, expecting the Knave to join you, but he stands and stares at the Queen, taken completely aback.  The Queen has seized her executioner's axe and is focusing her anger toward destroying the advancing shadows.  You slow your own assault and eventually stop to join in the Knave's staring as the Queen slices the dark minions to ribbons, screaming for blood and murder all the while.  It feels like barely any time has passed before every last shadow in the Queen's palace has either fallen to her furious assault, or retreated away from the castle.  Neither you nor the Knave had predicted this outcome at all, but it certainly was effective."
msgstr ""

msgid "Even after brutally dispatching the shadows, the Queen's anger isn't satisfied yet.  She marches toward you with fire still burning in her eyes and the executioner's axe still in hand.  Someone is going to die for what she just went through, and you are still at the top of her list.  You look to the Knave and he looks to you, his eyes narrowing.  Is he prepared to sell you out to save his own head?  Are you prepared to do the same?  You have little time to think the dilemma over before the Queen cuts you short."

"Even with death looming, you have to admit that owe the destruction of the shadows largely to the Knave and his plan.  Before he can speak, you vouch for the Knave and try to calm the Queen, but unfortunately she's beyond reason.  She swings wildly at you both, and you scatter while she screams for her guards.  You flee through the palace, wondering how you might escape her clutches, when the Knave pulls you into the hedges.  He leads you down a circuitous route that avoids the guard patrols and gradually winds its way to the door in the tree.\n"
"\"I don't suppose you'd mind if I tagged along for the time being?\" the Knave asks you with a hint of uncertainty in his voice, \"I won't be welcome in the court anymore by any means, and… I really must admit, I didn't expect any sort of loyalty from you.  The least I can do is return it.\"  One surprise deserves another as you've gained an unlikely ally in the scheming nobleman, though you're relieved for it to be a beneficial surprise this time."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Queen's attention snaps to the Knave at your quick accusation.  The nobleman's nerve fails him as he tries to deflect blame back at you while the Queen advances.  He finally tries to flee, but too late as the axe swings.  In one clean motion, the Knave's head launches from his shoulder and rolls to a stop several yards away.  You try to slip away as well, but the sudden arrival of a battalion of card guards hems you in close to the Queen.  Tense seconds pass, but finally the Queen turns to you with a pleasant expression on her face, in contrast to the blood on her hands and dress.  \"You've done me quite a service in finding the thief and saving us the trouble of a trial!  And such service deserves a reward!  Seeing as my executioner has been lax in his duties, I hereby award you the rank and responsibilities of royal executioner instead.\"  She shoves the axe into your hands and strides demurely away, leaving you disturbed, but alive."

"Even after the shadows have been chopped to bits, the Queen keeps up her furious attacks, dicing them into yet finer bits while screaming about her tarts.  You and the Knave wait until the Queen has worn herself out before you dare approach her.  She whirls around to meet you, but her expression has lifted to a smile.  \"Vermin of some sort, I might have guessed that they would steal my lovely tarts!\"  The Knave quickly affirms her false suspicion and you nod in agreement, not wanting to provoke the Queen any further.  \"If only I wasn't forced to dispose of them myself.  I require a new executioner!\"  The Queen's eyes settle on you at once and she shoves the axe into your hands.  \"You will do, my congratulations.\"  She marches off, calling for the fresh batch of tarts on the double as she goes.\n"
"The Knave pulls you aside as soon as the Queen is out of sight.  \"I hadn't expected success on that scale, or… any scale, really.  I had intended to take my leave as soon as the shadows had been drawn out, but you really did complicate things, for the better, I must say.  All of this is I suppose to say… I do owe you quite a bit.  If I can assist you - within reason, of course - then I shall be eag- erm, willing to do so.\"  Within reason, he says.  There's none of that to be had in Wonderland, but you'll have plenty of use for the Knave's underhanded talents all the same."

msgid "You make a swift departure from the Queen's court with the knowledge and experience under your belt to help you combat the shadows wherever they may lurk."
