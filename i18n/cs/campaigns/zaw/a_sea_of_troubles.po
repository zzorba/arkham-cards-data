"The scenery continues for mile after mile until at last you find an anomaly.  Some distance up the beach from a saltwater pool and near the edge of a dense forest sit the remains of a quaint cottage.  It looks like a disaster photograph, with the thatch roof exploding upward and the wooden walls splintering out, but with each piece suspended in air.  You approach the house cautiously, and as you circle the building, you see the White Rabbit - the same one that traversed Arkham not long ago!  The rabbit wails anxiously to two other figures that regard him sadly -  a man and a lizard.  \"My house, my poor house!  Oh the monster that must have done this!\"\n"
"The dirt-caked man shakes his head forlornly and strokes his chin as he surveys the damage.  \"And a monster that didn't even finish what it started, your honor!  It didn't think to let the pieces fall before it vanished away!\"\n"
"\"Never you mind the pieces, Pat!\" the White Rabbit snaps, \"Call someone to put it back together!  Oh, how late I shall be…\"\n"
"You take a half step forward, only for the grinning head of the Cheshire Cat to wink into existence before you.  \"The poor rabbit, not a roof over his head to speak of.\"  The cat's paw appears and gestures toward the shattered house.  \"As Gurathnaka claws at your world with its front, its back nails gouge into Wonderland.  The shadows crept at the corners until now, only seen by those who also lurk in the dark, solitary as oysters.\"  Its eyes glance in the direction of the beach and vanish, leaving only its smile to linger a few moments after.  You have only a few seconds to consider the cat's words.\n"
"\"You there!\"  You look down from the suspended grin to see the White Rabbit looking up at you haughtily.  \"Standing with idle hands when there's a monster about!  Come come, help Bill to find this beast and drag it back! It has much to answer for!\"  His finger points to the lizard who tips his cap back at you hesitantly.\n"
"Before you can reply in any fashion, the White Rabbit turns back to the cottage and resumes his despairing.  You rub the back of your neck, at a loss for words as you weigh your options.  Forced into work as you are, there's a chance you might learn something by venturing out into the surf."

"Darkness eats away at the beach behind you as you escape the calamity.  The White Rabbit watches anxiously towards the commotion, and begins to panic as the darkness sweeps inland. \"The monster has returned!\" he shrieks, taking terrified backward steps, \"Not my house, anything but that!\"  He scrambles through the cottage door and shuts it tight before you can dissuade him.  You try to reason with the rabbit, hoping to bring him to his senses, but he remains locked inside in quiet terror.  As the shadows advance, you have no choice but to turn and flee.  You look back over your shoulder to see the White Rabbit's house vanish into the advancing darkness with the crunch and shudder of timbers.\n"
"Gradually, the flowing shadows creep to a halt, and like a riptide sweep back out to sea at the same speed that they consumed inward.  Wherever the darkness recedes, the landscape it leaves behind is warped and cracked.  You retrace your steps hesitantly, returning to the ground where the White Rabbit's house once stood.  Only scratched stone from the foundation remains, with no trace of the rabbit to speak of.  You can only speculate why the shadows lashed out as they did.  Perhaps your presence drove them ravenous for the taste of the real world, or perhaps they are merely running wild as their master occupies itself with Arkham."

"The dark creature's destruction sends out a force like the opposite of a shockwave.  A wall of stillness sweeps outward from the remains, and for a minute you can hear the blood rushing in your ears as the shadows evaporate before you.  The swell of the sea returns slowly, and the taste of the salt air rouses your senses.  The beach behind you seems brighter and warmer than before, and you take exhausted steps back inland.\n"
"Further back, amid the sedge grass and small dunes, you find the Walrus and the Carpenter lying in wretched states.  The sand around them is stained with darkness, and the last driplets of shadow leak from the corners of their mouths as they lie groaning.  \"A rotten bunch… it's shellfish poisoning, I'll wager…\" the Carpenter mumbles as he clutches his stomach.  The Walrus can only grunt painfully in agreement as it rolls to one side.  After everything this pair did to the oysters, and you besides, you must decide what to do with them."
msgstr ""

msgid "In spite of everything, the two gluttons are as much a part of Wonderland as the oysters are.  Everyone has to eat something, after all.  You take a small amount of time to help them recover from their possession.  The Walrus and the Carpenter give you no thanks, but they do comment on their experience of being overtaken by the shadows with rather embellished details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Weakened as they may be, the greedy duo is responsible for plenty of destruction and death already, and might rampage again, given the chance.  You quickly and quietly dispatch the Walrus and the Carpenter, who offer no opposition whatsoever to their demise."

"The sand transitions back to dirt as you return to the White Rabbit's house.  You find that the suspended fragments of his house have collapsed down, and the rabbit is now fussing over the mess.  \"Dear, dear, another mess!  Where is that workman?  He may as well have been another monster, for all the good he did!\"  The White Rabbit snorts in frustration and turns toward you.  \"And you!  Have you brought the monster with you?\"  You do your best to explain the ordeal, and the rabbit nods along with growing look of disturbance on his face.\n"
"As you end your tale, the White Rabbit jerks with a sudden twitch and grabs for his pocket watch.  \"No, no, I'm even more late now!  I must hurry!  Must find my gloves, or the Duchess will be furious!\"  He dashes towards the door, having completely dismissed you in his hurry.  You quickly try to question the rabbit further about Wonderland and the dangers ahead, but your words fall on deaf ears.  The rabbit is absorbed in his new task utterly and will not spare a moment for anything else.  You depart with a sigh, resigned to spend your precious time elsewhere.  However, between the oyster's advice and your triumph over the shadows here, you feel as though you are on the right path."
