"You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House and hide Daniel from the authorities, although you’re unsure how long you’ll be able to stay in Arkham with an escaped asylum patient. Daniel is a loose cannon, dazed and unresponsive one moment, and screaming for his life the next. It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”\n"
"Hours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts, mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that he has been choked to death."

msgid "You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House, unsure whether news of the events at the asylum will get out to the general public. You take this time to make extensive notes of the events you’ve experienced thus far, including the brief dialogue between you and Daniel. He’d spoke of The King in Yellow as if it were an actual being, and even named it. “Hastur.” He’d rambled and muttered and screeched other phrases, as well. You doubt you’ll ever forget them. “He made us speak the Oath.” “The price was paid.” “They are opening the path to Carcosa.” For hours, you think about Daniel’s warning to you, which he begged you to heed: “Do not speak His name.” His final moments play out in your mind over and over again."

"On the third night, you return to your room to find the door broken open. You enter cautiously, wondering if the police are onto you. Or worse, the Stranger. You are surprised to find the body of Daniel Chesterfield instead, lying on the ground with a pained, wide-eyed expression on his face. He is dead. His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n"
"<center><fancy>[elder_sign]Carcosa is real</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>Do not let them open the path</fancy></center>\n"
"When Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:\n"
"<center><fancy>Hastur is the king in tatters</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>locked in his prison in the stars</fancy></center>\n"
"<center><fancy>seal him away and stop this madness!</fancy></center>\n"
"Your mind swims with questions. How did he escape the asylum? How did he die? And why does he appear human to your eyes now? With little time to spare, you clean the room of your belongings and flee. Daniel’s words, which he begged you to heed, play out in your mind over and over again."
