msgid "Everyone has their role to play in the performance of life. You’re not sure how long it has been since <i>The King in Yellow</i> came to Arkham’s Ward Theatre. Since then, you’ve put it out of your mind, dismissing it as an unexplained, and incredibly vivid, hallucination. But then you heard it. At first it came to you in your dreams, the haunting melody of the production’s orchestral score, now presented by a single violin. It has led you to a corner of Arkham you had been avoiding: the Ward Theatre. The Theatre is dark and quiet, save for that melody only you can hear..."

msgid "With the violinist defeated, you can only hope that the last specter of that unholy production is finally put to rest. Every day following the events at the Ward Theatre, your nerves are coiled tight, always expecting to hear the melody. The days pass, the melody never returns, and it would seem you are allowed to continue your life as if the events surrounding <i>The King in Yellow</i> had never truly happened. But they did, didn’t they?"

"Unable to withstand the soloist any longer, you drop to your knees, letting the overwhelming power of the melody wash over you like an unstoppable flood. The notes fill your ears, drowning out every other thought. Your vision fades, the reality of the Ward Theatre growing dark, warping and stretching at odd angles.\n"
"You squeeze your eyes shut, trying to focus on what you can feel, to keep yourself grounded. Your hands are pressed into coarse sand, and every few seconds you feel cold water lapping at your fingertips. After what feels like minutes you open your eyes again to see the tall spires of that ancient city, reaching up to a sky lit with black stars. The violin is now joined by an unseen orchestra, reaching a deafening crescendo. You try to rise from your knees, but your shaking legs give out, and you fall onto your back…\n"
"…and land on the dusty wooden boards of a stage. The sound of your collapse echoes off of the cavernous walls of the Ward Theatre. You stare up at the dark ceiling above as you lie on the proscenium. The soloist is gone. The monsters are gone. The Theatre is dark and seemingly abandoned, save for you.\n"
"You rise slowly, then turn and flee, not wanting to look for any signs of your experience. You are convinced that this place is cursed, that the production is cursed, and that this curse will haunt you for the rest of your days.\n"
"As you push through the front doors of the theatre and back out into the street, you hear the haunting melody in your head once more…"
