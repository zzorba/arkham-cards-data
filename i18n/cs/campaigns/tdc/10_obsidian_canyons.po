msgid "\"Am I dreaming?\" Andy looks out at the horizon. Ephemeral shapes coalesce and then dissipate in the mists below. In the distance, you see the Obsidian Gates where you made landfall. The wide expanse between you and it is filled with mind-bending spires and poisonous green mist. Andy curses as he dumps water out of his camera bag. \"Mr. Tillinghast assured me this bag was airtight. I told him all I wanted was pictures, maybe a book deal. And now it's all ruined.\""

msgid "The streets of R'lyeh are flooded with stagnant water and a foul, bilious smell you cannot identify. After spending hours making little progress from where you made landfall, you find a climbable path up to the summit. Using your rope and a little climbing gear, you reach the nearest vantage point. The ancient dome beckons to you in the distance. \"Just don't look down,\" Ruby says. \"If you fall, I'm not peeling you off the ground.\""

"The alien city sprawls for miles. Chunks of broken spires are suspended in the air above collapsed towers,and colorful reefs hang from the undersides of ancient bridges. Decaying wrecks of ancient ships lean precariously atop the obsidian spires, swaying gently. You and your companions stare in awe at the unbelievable landscape.\n"
"A gale-force wind nearly sweeps you off your feet. You steady yourself and look to the south to see dark, angry storm clouds crackling with green energy. The breeze reaches a howling crescendo, then suddenly dies down. The landscape below seems to rearrange as miasmic clouds bend and swirl. Your head swims; when you look back at the horizon, the skyline has changed entirely."

In your mind's eye, you see a corona of light, a sky filled with tenebrous shadows, and a gargantuan figure writhing in pain, covered in glowing sigils. Is it a vision? Or an ancient memory? You see the city spires bow like blades of grass as meteors fall from the sky. Something inside you stirs. You are feeling someone— or something— else's sorrow. The city buried, serene, doomed to sleep on the ocean floor for vigintillion years. Whatever it is that you feel, it wants to share your burdens, your fears, your desires. You need only to let it in…"
