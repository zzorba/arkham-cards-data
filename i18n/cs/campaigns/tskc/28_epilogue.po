"“Talk,” Commissioner Taylor commands.\n"
"You shift in your uncomfortable metal chair, the glaring light of her interrogation lamp nearly blinding you. One wall of the sterile interrogation chamber is covered by a black mirror that reflects you and the Commissioner sitting across a desk from one another, your faces blanched under heavy white light. Knowing the Foundation, several operatives are watching and recording your every move from behind the mirror. A thick dossier lies unopened on the desk between you and Taylor."

"Rather than answer directly, you ask instead what Taylor expected when she conscripted a random set of people into a Foundation cell. She looks genuinely caught off-guard as you explain your work and your role in assisting the Red Coterie to suppress what was clearly the greatest threat to humanity. The commissioner’s eye arches as you lean back in your seat in a gesture of casual indifference.\n"
"“I… see,” she visibly suppresses a grimace. You see her gaze linger on your crimson regalia. “You were hired for your curiosity, ingenuity, and independence. A statement which—may I remind you—is not to be taken as any form of compliment or commendation. It was an assumed risk that you might fall in with the Red Coterie, but one which I assured senior command was highly unlikely, if not impossible.”\n"
"A heavy silence falls as the commissioner makes a near-imperceptible nod at the black mirror to her left, then looks back to you.\n"
"“This, then, is no longer a briefing, but a negotiation. Understand that your role at the Foundation is terminated forthwith. All assets and privileges you previously enjoyed are rescinded, along with your prior rank and compensation.” You detect a hint of regret in her voice as she locks eyes with you. “Instead, let us view this as an opportunity. We have been at odds with the Coterie long enough; perhaps it is time that we worked together.”\n"
"Beyond the commissioner’s steely-eyed professionalism, you sense something else in her voice. Is it respect? She gives you an intense look.\n"
"“The Foundation and the Coterie, as partners. What do you say? Are you in?”"

"You find yourself awkwardly repeating events and names as you struggle to relay your experience to the commissioner. Throughout it all, Taylor remains silent, listening to your various rabbit trails and accounts of events with an air of reserve. When you have finished, she slides a glass of water across the desktop toward you. You see your shadowy reflection glimmer within the black mirror in the corner of your eye.\n"
"“What an… unrestrained account,” she says matter-of-factly. A heavy silence falls as the commissioner makes a near-imperceptible nod at the black mirror to her left, then looks back to you.\n"
"“The Foundation thanks you for your service. Understand that everything you have done during your tenure with the Foundation is classified, and you are bound under threat of execution to never share this account with another soul: living or dead.” She locks eyes with you. “Do you understand?”\n"
"You nod, and the commissioner goes on. “It goes without saying, but I must inform you that your temporary ‘cell’ has been disavowed and all assets acquired during your Foundation service will be retained for further study and research. Your account of all events involving paracausal disturbance will be extracted, analyzed, and preserved for future analysis.”"

"Commissioner Taylor produces a black leather briefcase from behind the desk, opens it, and slides a Foundation badge across the table to you. “Bureaucratic flim-flam, of course. Your cell has been dissolved and you have received approval to join the Foundation with full clearance, full stop. Whether or not you wish to join is irrelevant; you have seen and accomplished too much to return to civilian life.”\n"
"The badge gleams in the harsh light as you turn it over in your hand. It has surprising heft. The sudden weight of everything that has happened hits you as your thumb plays over the grooves and ridges of the metal surface. Taylor flips open the dossier on the table and continues.\n"
"“Your date of hire is yesterday. Don’t worry: you will receive backpay as well as a sizeable compensation package for your work on the case. Which—on that—we are considering labeling ‘The Scarlet Keys.’ It has a nice ring to it, though it is a bit extravagant for my taste.”\n"
"The faintest hint of a smile tugs at the commissioner’s lips. “Well, what have you got to say? Cat got your tongue?”"

"Commissioner Taylor opens the dossier in front of her and slides a set of tickets across the table to you.\n"
"“These are one-way tickets that will take you anywhere in the world, no questions asked. Given your troublesome curiosity, I recommend you go somewhere quiet and forgettable, assume an alias, and take up a profession that does not allow you so much free time or thinking. Oh, and stop wearing that,” she says, gesturing off-handedly at your appearance.\n"
"You interrupt and try to explain yourself. The commissioner holds up one hand to silence you.\n"
"“In truth, I must inform you that you are getting off rather easily here. If the higher-ups had their say, you would have been summarily executed for your reckless handling of this case. The word ‘collusion’ was tossed around. Had you toed the line, this case might have made your career. In my estimation, you have created far more trouble than you resolved.”\n"
"Taylor stands up, and you stand with her. Several burly suits step through the door behind you, flooding the room with light. The commissioner gives you a firm handshake, her eyes locked with yours. “The Foundation thanks you for your service. May we never meet again.”"
