msgid "Once again safe, you and your companions set up camp in silence. You marvel at how much quieter the evening is compared to those that came before, be it due to your dwindling numbers or the grim mood that hangs over the camp. But the quiet is anything but peaceful. As the hours pass, you can't seem to get any rest. You decide instead to check on your companions…"

msgid "If William Dyer is alive:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The professor paces back and forth, running his fingers through his graying hair. “They are connected. They must be connected,” he rambles to himself as you approach. “The Elder Things and these manifestations, these ‘mirages’,” he continues, as if to answer your unspoken question. “When we were here last, I saw images of the Elder Things in conflict with other species, other… alien beings. But what if the true source of their fear lies here on Earth?” His gaze meets yours. “What if this wasn't their true home? What if… what if they were guarding something?”"

As you suspected, none of the creatures he depicted look anything like the things you saw. But just as you are about to give up, you find several sketches of the city he claims to have found beyond the dark, jagged mountains. These depict an enormous archway emblazoned with five glyphs surrounded by a five-pointed star. Below the archway—or perhaps behind it—looms something grotesque. The lines of the sketch disintegrate into a tangle of light strokes and splotches of ink you can scarcely describe. Several more creatures with barrel-shaped bodies and starfish-like heads—the alien “Elder Things” Dyer described in his report—flank the archway, looking on reverently, their wing-like appendages spread forth in reverence. You wish you could ask Dyer himself what this may mean, but sadly, it’s too late for that. You collect his sketches and bring them with you, hoping they might come in handy later."

msgid "If Danforth is alive:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Nobody else seems to understand Danforth’s ramblings, but you think you're starting to. Or, at the very least, you're the only one trying. After all, whatever he saw during the last journey here, it lies at the heart of all of this. “It was… it…” he pauses, his voice hitching as he tries to explain. “It was like the creatures we’ve seen. Ink, mist, and color. Or, at least, I think that the only way our human eyes might interpret their true shape.” His own eyes are distant, glazed over with horror as he reimagines the mirage. “It is still here. Bound, shackled. But not for long, I fear. Not for long.”"

msgid "You decide to seek wisdom in Danforth’s belongings, hoping he kept a journal or some evidence from his prior expedition with Dyer. What you find instead is a treasure trove of fiction both macabre and speculative, including a well-worn copy of the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Its pages are punctuated by many makeshift tabs, and its margins inscribed with many notes and jottings—some relevant, others whose true meaning eludes you. You’re not sure why Danforth thought there was any reason to bring such a collection of tales, most especially one so beloved to him. You open it to one of the tabbed pages and read: “He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ‘Tekeli-li!’” In the margins, Danforth has scribbled: “What could force one out of such paroxysm? How can I leave this dreadful feeling behind?”"

She looks up from her desk and tilts her glasses down to gaze at you directly. “Here to inquire after my findings?” she asks, to which you nod. “Very well.” You note her unusually warm demeanor as you approach and peer over her shoulder. In front of her, a section of one of an Elder Thing's limbs is dissected with expert precision. Dark green liquid stains its scaly flesh and the surface beneath it alike. She raises her glasses once again and turns to face her anatomical sample. “It's not unlike us,” she says, “just as Dyer suggested in his own account. And yet, somehow, they are able to survive incredible pressure and cold. Perhaps even the vacuum of space. What I don't understand is …” she breathes deep, and continues. “Dyer's report only accounts for the waking of a few of these creatures from their hibernation. Why, then, are so many of them active?”"

"You survey the research notes left behind by the leader of this doomed expedition. Surely, if anyone could make some sense out of what you’ve seen so far, it would be Dr. Kensler. Perhaps she knew more about these creatures than she let on. You scour her tent and filter through her belongings until you come across a thick journal filled with meticulous notes regarding the journey to Antarctica and the first couple days you spent unloading supplies and setting up camp. From there, the notes become less detailed and more jumbled. Her recounting of the days leading up to the plane crash is less a well-kept diary and more a delirious tangent. She wrote of walls dripping with black miasma, an endless void beneath the ice, something evil and alien that dwelled at the core beyond the gateway—and then, nothing.\n"
"Dr. Kensler had not been one to recount dreams or author works of fiction. Something had rattled her. Something had made her see the things of which she wrote. But how? And when? You sit and continue her documentation with your own record of events, hoping grimly that if you don’t make it off this continent alive, someone will read this and know what transpired here…"

You had come to her expecting a roll of her eyes and a scolding over your condition. “Oh, come on. I'm not allowed to worry? After everything we've seen and been through, I think I'm overdue a bit of fretting.” At her insistance, you allow her to examine you for wounds and early signs of hypothermia. “We're lucky to still be alive you know,” she says quietly as she unpacks her medical kit. “Or maybe…” she clicks her teeth, and shakes her head. “…maybe they're the lucky ones.”"

Still, perhaps you can salvage some use out of her old medical kits and cold-weather gear. As you stuff her medical supplies into one of her backpacks, a shiver crawls up your back. You tell yourself it is out of necessity, but helping yourself to the belongings of the dead still weighs heavily on your conscience. You heft the backpack straps onto your shoulders and turn to leave Dr. Sinha’s tent, hoping to put this grim business out of mind. The quiet clatter of something falling out of the backpack’s front pocket catches your attention. You search around your feet for the object and find a small leather wallet containing only a hairpin, a picture of Dr. Sinha with what you can only assume to be her family, and a ticket stub for a show at the Riverview Theatre. Without truly thinking why, you pocket it. If it was important enough for her to keep, it must hold some sentiment."

msgid "You come to Cookie late at night, when everyone should be asleep. The remains of the campfire smolder silently between the two of you, dim light casting a dancing shadow behind his hunched figure. “Hope yer not here for advice,” he mutters at long last. You shake your head and inform him that you're just here for the companionship. “Sure, sure. Can't sleep, more like,” he accuses. You say nothing in response. You cannot refute the truth. He takes a long, hard breath, then goes on. “When we were in the trenches, we almost never slept. It was hard enough in those conditions, in the dirt and mud, covered in flies. And anytime we tried, the Germans would wake us up with mortar fire. The exhaustion was unbearable.” His stare burns into the fire. “Even an hour or two was a godsend. But I got through that hell, somehow, despite everything tryin' to kill me.” You ask him how you're supposed to do the same.

You sit by the campfire and examine the items in the satchel one by one. Inside are several of Cookie’s personal effects—a pocketwatch with a cracked face, a matchbook emblazoned with the logo of the Excelsior Hotel, and of course his trusty .32 Colt revolver. It is exceptionally well-maintained, its barrel polished clean and its wooden grip immaculate. Knowing Cookie, it had less to do with his love of the thing and more to do with old habits dying hard. You swing the cylinder out and note that only a few bullets remain. You rotate the cylinder idly and give Cookie a silent promise: Don’t worry. I’ll put these bullets to good use."

I mean, that too, but look-” he points to the enormous peaks looming around the city in every direction, like a boundary. “It's built to block and funnel the wind. They chose precisely the right place to build their city. And the way these structures and streets are built, they're mostly protected from excess snowfall.” He glances at you meaningfully before continuing. “These creatures chose the harshest place on Earth to make their home, and despite all odds, they thrived.” You wonder if perhaps this means the inclement weather you've faced thus far will abate during the next leg of your journey. “Unlikey,” he responds. “A lot of the natural safeguards they built into their city seem to have weathered away. And there's likely a lot more ice than there would have been back in their time. But I'll make sure we avoid the nastiest of it.”"

Without Claypool, you are defenseless against the dangerous weather. Being caught out in a polar storm would be deadly, and he was the only one with the expertise to accurately predict them. You sigh and make to leave, stopping momentarily to glance at the heavy fur coat bundled with the remainder of Claypool’s things. Then you glance down at your own: worn and ragged from your arduous journey. You pick up Claypool’s and leave your old coat behind.

It' ll be far easier than slogging through the snow, don't you think? Here, I'll mark it on our map. Let us get back to camp before we lose our way.”"
