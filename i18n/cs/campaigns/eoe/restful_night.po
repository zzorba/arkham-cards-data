"Safe at last, you and the remaining members of the expedition take stock of your situation. You have lost several members of the team, but your members remain strong. Part of you knows that staying any longer would prove foolish or deadly. But a great many questions crowd your thoughts, demanding answers despite your worries. What were those uncanny, Phantasmal creatures? What happened here after Dyer’s expedition left the icy wastes behind?\n"
"You and the others discuss the situation at length and consider various plans. Some believe in the total abandonment of the expedition. But to return empty-handed now would prove disastrous for the university, frustrate the scientific community, and possibly cost the remaining crew their careers. After all, very few believed Dyer’s outlandish claims --who would believe this?\n"
"In the end, you decide to press onward. Another flight is out of the question, of course. That thing in the sky must still be out there. It was a miracle you survived one aeroplane crash, let alone two. No, there’s only one way to reach the site described in Dyer’s report now: you must travel on foot.\n"
"The decision made, you retire to get what meager rest you can before the grueling trek ahead."

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team fled to the mountains</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."

msgid "The professor jumps as you approach, startled by your sudden presence. “Oh! My apologies. I thought—I thought perhaps you were…” he trails off, but he doesn’t need to finish his sentence. You know exactly how he feels. “I am a man of science, as you know. And as a man of science, I find myself struggling to…to come to terms with what we have seen thus far.” You nod and ask Dyer to explain his current working theory. “Well,” he begins, “these spectral creatures, they seem to possess some kind of ethereal physiology, very unlike the Elder Things that Lake and his team discovered and dissected the last time I was here. Those creatures might have been of alien origin, but they were…like us, in more ways than one. Flesh and organs, you see. But these…” he ponders in silence for some time. “And yet, I cannot help but wonder what the connection between the two might be?”"

msgid "Danforth mutters to himself over and over as you enter his tent: “‘…There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope…and I could perceive…in the countenances of my companions…that they had made up their minds to perish…’” The cadence of his voice suggests he is reciting something by memory rather than speaking his thoughts aloud. It’s only after you loudly clear your throat that he seems to notice your presence. His eyes are wide and unblinking. “Now you understand,” he says under his breath. “You have seen what I have seen.” You nod. There can be no doubt any longer. Whatever Danforth saw when he and the professor escaped their ill-fated journey is the same entity that smote your aircraft to the ground. “It knows we are here,” he says gloomily. “It sees us.”"

msgid "The leader of the expedition gives you little heed as you enter her tent. Her eyes are instead glued to the microscope in front of her. She appears to be studying a glob of inky, multicolored ichor in a small petri dish. She must have recovered some of that gunk earlier. You ask if she thinks it’s safe to be studying it so closely. “Of course not,” she responds in dry monotone. “But sometimes, scientific progress requires an element of…jeopardy.” It’s true, in a way—you’re only here at all because the team decided to put themselves at risk in order to confirm the truth behind Dyer’s report. You ask Dr. Kensler what she has discovered. “Frustratingly little. Physiologically speaking, this substance is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I’m…not even completely sure it is a liquid. It seems to possess qualities of all three states of matter.” She finally sets the microscope aside, covers the petri dish, and meets your gaze. “It would be fascinating, were it not trying to kill us.”"

msgid "Dr. Sinha gives you a hard glare as you approach. “If you tell me that you are ‘too cold to sleep,’ so help me…” she begins, but sighs as you shake your head. “Sorry. I know, I know. Show me your wounds, then. Let me do my job.” She pulls out her medical kit and motions for you to sit on the bedroll nearby. “No signs of frostbite, hypothermia, or gangrene, that is good…” In silence, she studies the bruises and surface injuries you sustained from the crash. Finally, she clicks her tongue and shakes her head. “Uncanny,” she murmurs under her breath. You give her an inquiring stare. “Two aeroplanes,” she explains, “over a dozen of us spread between the two, and yet we sustained more injuries from the journey across the ice shelf than we did in the crash. Except for…” she trails off into harsh silence. As she dresses your wounds, you think about the meaning behind her words, the truth that she doesn’t want to say out loud. Was the entity that forced your plane to the ground really trying to kill you? Or was it simply guiding you? And if so, to what?"

msgid "Cookie stares into the campfire as you approach, clearly in a world of his own. His distant eyes reflect the dim, flickering firelight. Who knows what he really sees within? The moment you begin to speak, he startles out of his reverie. “Ah. S’only you,” he mutters, his voice gravelly. “Siddown. Fire’s not just for me.” You do, taking off your gloves and warming up your hands for a moment before asking Cookie what he thinks of the plan. “What do I think?” He almost laughs. “I think yer deluded, the lot of yeh. But what do I know.” You suspect aloud that he knows a lot more than the others think. “That so?” he asks in grim monotone. “’Bout war, maybe,” he growls. “But maybe that’s what this is after all. Right then. You wanna know what I know? Fine.” You listen intently as Cookie tells you his harrowing tales of the Great War, tales that would surely give you nightmares were you not already in one."

msgid "Claypool is examining a map of the Ross Ice Shelf as you approach, tracing his fingers over topographical lines. “We were supposed to have better weather conditions,” he explains as you hunch over next to him. “I don’t know how or why, but something is messing with the weather patterns here. We’re getting hit with storms too sudden even for Antarctica, and the temperature variance is closer to what we would find in winter.” You ask Claypool if there’s anything that can be done to prevent further hardship. “The inclination might be to hunker down,” he replies, “and surely there are some among us who are too exhausted to go on. There are others who feel the opposite: that we should leave immediately and find safety elsewhere. I believe the best course of action is somewhere in between.” He taps the map in front of him again, beckoning you closer. “These storms are hitting fast and hard. We have to find our opening and move out the moment this one lets up,” he explains. You nod in approval."

"Curious, you pry a bit, asking Claypool what the deal is between him and Ellsworth. “Huh? Oh, Roald? We—that—” he stammers, avoiding your gaze. “He is just so damn stubborn. And hard to read.” You raise an eyebrow. “Okay, it is more than that. He is a loner. By his very nature. Getting close to somebody like that…” he sighs, trying to muster up the words. “…is difficult. For both parties.”\n"
"But worth it, you observe aloud.\n"
"“Yes, I suppose it can be,” he replies with a smile. “Sometimes.”"

msgid "Ellsworth throws you a pocket telescope as you meander through the camp, searching for a task. “You look free. Follow me,” he demands. You roll your eyes and follow begrudgingly as he leads you out into the snowy wilds. Over the howling winds, you ask loudly where he is taking you. “Higher,” Ellsworth responds simply. For nearly an hour, you follow him up a treacherous trail through rocky crags to an icy precipice overlooking the ice shelf. Black, jagged mountains loom in the distance, barely visible through the harsh snowfall. “There,” he says, pointing between two of the peaks. “What does that look like, to you?” You raise the telescope up to your eyes, careful not to press the cold glass against your skin lest it freeze there. Magnified by the device’s lens, you can just make out a narrow pass between the peaks. Perhaps this would be the optimal route to take tomorrow? You convey your thoughts to Ellsworth, and he nods along. “I agree. I’ll mark it on our map when we get back to camp.”"

msgid "Takada has all of your remaining supplies and provisions laid out before her in organized rows. “Before you ask: yes, I am serving as our quartermaster for the time being,” she explains. “We are down two planes and separated from the rest of our crew. We will have to be smart about our supplies if we are to continue this folly.” She spits that last word out like a curse, leaving you to ponder her feelings about the expedition. “Well, come on, don’t just stand there. Help me with this,” she scolds. You nod and get to work."

msgid "You find Eliyah on the outskirts of the camp, tending to the dogs and making sure they are ready for tomorrow’s journey. His trusty companion Anyu is by his side as always. The dog’s tail slaps back and forth rapidly as you approach. “Oh, hey there,” Eliyah says over his shoulder when he realizes Anyu’s spotted you. “Calm down, will you, Anyu?” he scolds playfully, reaching down to ruffle her ears. You ponder aloud if she realizes the danger you’re all in. “Oh, she knows,” Eliyah responds. “She is rather good at making all the troubles of the world fade away. It wouldn’t be the first time.” You wonder with a bit of curiosity what other adventures Eliyah and Anyu might have been on in the past. But before you can ask, a cold flask hits you square in the chest and tumbles into your hands. “Drink,” Eliyah offers. “It’ll warm you up.” He sits down and drinks from a flask of his own, motioning for you to join him. You do, gulping down a large swallow. It burns on its way down. Anyu lies between the two of you, nudging your hand pleadingly. No more words are spoken, but Eliyah is right. For just a moment, everything is okay."

msgid "Silence falls over the camp as, one by one, the team falls into deep slumber. You try your damnedest to get some rest yourself, but every time you close your eyes, the image of those phantasmal creatures comes seeping behind your eyelids, and you shoot awake. You wonder morbidly if death is the only way you will ever rest on this journey."

"You awaken with a start and immediately reach for a weapon to defend yourself. The sound that pierced through your dreams and shook you back into reality was not one any earthly creature could make, and yet, when you awaken, nothing is out of place. In fact…\n"
"You rise to your feet, shocked, and examine your surroundings. Your makeshift camp was protected from the harsh elements, but still deep in the Antarctic wilderness. And yet, you find yourself indoors, in a hall you cannot place despite a strange familiarity. You brush aside some of the snow that still lingers on the ground around your sleeping bag, noting a tiled floor that wasn’t there before. A dream?\n"
"As you doubt the truth of this mysterious place, the walls and the tiled floor shimmer and fade. You are left back in the freezing cold of your camp, surrounded by your companions—except the door leading out of that hall still remains. Thick gray mist swirls around you, guiding you onward.\n"
"This is no natural refraction of light. Something supernatural is at work here. The thick miasma that churns around your camp is not unlike the substance that makes up the nightmarish creatures you encountered after your plane crashed. Do you really want to know what it wants you to see?"
