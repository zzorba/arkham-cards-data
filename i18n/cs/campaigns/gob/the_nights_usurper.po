"Winlock fiddles with his mustache for a moment while he considers your words. As the leader of the expedition currently scouring through Dashur, the decision of whether or not to let you join the expedition is up to him. “Look, I read through the evidence you gathered. I know about what happened in Cairo. I believe your story. But, still…” He lets out an exasperated sigh. “I just don’t know how I’m going to convince the rest of the expedition crew. Ancient temples is one thing, but a gate to another dimension? This ‘Xzharah’ fellow? None of this can be real, right?”\n"
"Your research and your experience says otherwise. The threat is real. There is a secret organization operating within Egypt—The Brotherhood of the Beast—and if they are not stopped, their newfound “Chosen One” will begin a campaign of destruction that ends with the Earth.\n"
"You insist one last time to be allowed access to the expedition’s resources. “Alright, alright,” Winlock relents. “I don’t know what it is you’re looking for out there in the desert, but I hope you find it.” You shake your head in reply. You’d rather come up empty‑handed."

"“It’s just an arch. Why’re you so worked up, boss?” Winlock crossed his arms. Something about all of this felt wrong. He was sure that this was the place those folks from Arkham were looking for—a delicately patterned archway that led nowhere at all—and yet, Winlock was certain there was something <i>on the other side</i>. “It’s not Egyptian,” he noted, staring at the thing with narrow eyes. “It doesn’t even look…human.”\n"
"“You believed those loons? Look boss, it’s nothing!” one of his men laughed.\n"
"“Is it?” Winlock snapped, eyes wide. “Is it?”"

msgid "The essence fades from Xzharah’s body. Swirling clouds of mist surround him and force him to his knees. Creatures of the abyss appear wordlessly at your side, surrounding Xzharah with a quiet, expressionless hate. Xzharah’s sword betrays him and falls from his grip, the blade fracturing as it clatters to the ground. “…The prophecy must be fulfilled…” It is the last of his vile whispers. His physical form vanishes into the realm’s ethereal mist, and all is silent in the Great Abyss."

msgid "Xzharah places an ice-cold hand on your shoulder as you kneel before him. “You have proven your loyalty,” he decrees. Creatures of the abyss surround you, heads bowed in reverence to their new master. There are none left to oppose him. “Few of your kind have the wit or the will to see beyond the present. To see our prophecy fulfilled. But you are worthy enough to have your eyes opened. Far worthier than the fools I have trusted in the past.” He bids you to stand, and places the handle of his blood-soaked sword in your hands. “Now arise, Servant of the Beast, and take your place among us.”"
