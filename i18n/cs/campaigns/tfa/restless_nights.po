msgid "Those nights in the jungle, I barely slept. A strange fog rolled through the camp each night, plunging the area in an intense and peculiar cold. My bedroll offered some protection against the elements, but we hadn’t been prepared for this unnatural weather. Flies and mosquitoes buzzed in my ears every time I began to drift off. Even when I finally slept, I would soon be startled awake by the crawling of an insect or lizard across my face. I wager I’ll get very little sleep on this journey…"

msgid "Mercifully, I was able to sleep through each night. However, while my body rested, my mind was plagued by nightmares. A cavern like a gaping maw, bathed in dim red light…the walls slithering with the glimmering scales of a hundred vipers…it might have been better had I not slept at all."

msgstr ""

msgid "Each night, I was watched. I didn’t just feel watched: I saw the eyes peering out from the inky darkness that surrounded our camp. They knew we were there. The yellow eyes watched me, alert, my weapons drawn, ready to defend the camp if the need arose. Our eyes met, and a darkness seized my heart."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most of the nights passed without incident, but on this night, I was startled by the rustling of tree branches along the southern border of our camp’s clearing. Despite the darkness, I was able to use my binoculars to see shapes moving in the trees. The shapes appeared human, but…why? Why do they only watch us from afar? What is their purpose?"
