"As you approach Atwood Farm, the clouds recede to reveal a blood-red sunset that casts the landscape in hazy shadows. You follow Dr. Marquez past a neglected coop and barn to the back porch of the derelict farmhouse. As the professor jams a crowbar under a boarded window, you notice the revolver in her back pocket. “Just some insurance,” she says.\n"
"It takes some time to pry the boards off the windows. As you climb in after the professor, your senses sting with the scent of rot and sick. Once your eyes adjust to the murk, you see a harrowing scene. Dirty cots line the walls, and the floor is streaked with refuse. A dozen sickly people lay on cots and sit, slumped against the walls. Their skin is knotted and hard, riddled with sharp spurs and sinewy growths. Several of them have limp flaps of loose flesh that you soon realize are vestigial limbs. Others look up at you with glassy eyes, while others with gray, powdery skin lay, inert, staring up at the ceiling.\n"
"“You shouldn’t be here,” says a voice. A balding man in a tattered Vale cloak steps toward you with a halting gait. Dr. Marquez squints in the dim. “Tad? From the general store?” Before he can answer, you hear voices from the front porch. You and Dr. Marquez dash behind a pile of broken furniture just as the front door clicks and swings open. Mother Rachel enters alongside a half dozen cloaked figures and several more sickly locals.\n"
"The matron addresses the room, beaming. “My Star Children. Your time has come at last. You will prepare the way.” She leans down and holds a wheelchair-bound woman’s hand. “All of you have been made whole. And now you will join your other selves in eternity.”"

"Mother Rachel smiles benevolently. “My children. There are some things we are not meant to see until it is our time to see them. But then, I suppose, it is your place to witness our ascension.” She holds her arms out in an exultant pose. “Each of us accepts our place in creation. We have been remade beyond the concerns of conventional medicine. I understand it may seem foolish, even cruel, to an outsider, but each of us is here of our own volition. Even you.” The room nods along in agreement.\n"
"“You’re being deceived! Can’t you see?” Dr. Marquez says, furious. “These people are dying!” You search the room, hoping for some support."

"Mother Rachel’s eyes are glassy with tears as she addresses the room. “Your sacrifice is not in vain. Tonight, you each will fulfill your place in creation and join us tomorrow for the great ascension.” The matron wears a careworn smile as she addresses you. “This is not your sacrifice to make. Please, return to the Vale.” Dr. Marquez glowers in response. Mother Rachel’s eyes well with tears as she leaves with her procession.\n"
"“What did she mean by ‘ fulfill your place in creation’?” Dr. Marquez asks Tad as he rubs scaly growths from his forearms. The balding man smiles. “Tomorrow, the blood moon heralds our ascension. But tonight, on the shortest night of the year, all the creatures of the forest and fields will help us complete our journey.”\n"
"“I’m sorry, but that doesn’t answer my question,” the professor replies.\n"
"Tad grins. “We will all be devoured. It is our place to make this sacrifice.” As he looks to the horizon, a chorus of mournful howls echoes across the fields.\n"
"The professor looks at Tad, horrified. “Like hell you will,” she says. You follow her outside. Dark shapes stand outlined on distant hills. The professor is briefly lost in thought, then takes a sharp breath. “I doubt any of them are in their right mind. But maybe if we hold out long enough, we can get them proper care and attention.” You look past the farmhouse to the rolling fields. You don’t have time to evacuate the captives before sunset. Moreover, you don’t have any guarantee they’ll follow you. But you have to try.\n"
"Together, you and the professor scavenge the collapsing farm for spare parts. You find scraps of wood, barbed wire, and old trapping equipment to fortify your position. If you can outlast the night, some of the captives might be saved. A hideous baying breaks the still air as the sun sets.\n"
"The shortest night of the year just became the longest."

"The last thing you remember before the nightmarish shapes overwhelm you is a feeling of intense calm. The silver moonlight bathes the farm in stark monochrome as the creatures rip into your flesh. For a moment, you see your place in this world, as Mother Rachel intended. You are merely energy being converted to another form of energy.\n"
"Nothing else seems so perfect."
msgstr ""

msgid "“Please, listen,” Dr. Marquez implores the captives. “Each of you deserves to live a full life. We can help! You can receive care on the mainland.” Tad spits in response. “You’ve robbed us of a great privilege. We were chosen.” Dr. Marquez hardly answers before a jagged plank of wood swings out from behind her, striking her on the shoulder. One of the captives holds it overhead, while several others gather round. Tad looks balefully at the professor and growls, “Leave now.” Dr. Marquez rises gingerly and walks out of the farmhouse. You follow her. “Idiots. We saved their lives,” she scoffs. As you leave, a young girl wearing a rabbit mask peers out from under some debris. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tad stands in the center of the farmhouse, his white- gold Vale cloak stained crimson. Surrounding him, the half-eaten corpses of the slain captives are arranged in a kind of circle. When you approach, the middle-aged man laughs bitterly. “Why was I spared, and so many others taken?” He raises both hands to his face and laughs hysterically. “Why is everything so bright?!” he giggles, clawing at his own eyes. You turn away and join Dr. Marquez outside, hunched over a pile of wreckage. A young girl wearing a rabbit mask scrambles out from underneath the debris. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr ""

msgid "“We can’t stay!” Dr. Marquez shouts. Utterly overwhelmed, you dash out of the fray and into the cornfields. Nightmarish shadows charge past you, braying and howling. You think of the captives in the farmhouse, staring their deaths head-on. At the far edge of the field, you find Dr. Marquez holding a young girl wearing a rabbit mask. You recognize her as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The morning sun beats down, blindingly bright, as you cut through the fields back to the Vale. Flecks of slick, dark liquid drip from the withered stalks as you push through. Dr. Marquez stops and runs a hand under the brittle leaves. “The fields are painted with blood. But why?” She wipes the blood on a handkerchief and surveys the dripping field. “What kind of monster would do this? Sentencing her followers—her own daughter—to death. It’s almost biblical.”\n"
"Rebecca pulls back her mask and shakes her head. “Mother says it’s our way. And she doesn’t want me to die. She told me to hide. She said we were playing a game. ‘Make yourself very small and hide near the barrels of kerosene. The animals won’t smell you there’.”\n"
"“But why bring you here at all?” the professor asks.\n"
"“Some people didn’t want to come to the barn. But when mama told them I would be there too, they said it was okay.”\n"
"The group falls silent as you pass from one field and back into view of the Vale, veiled in gold under the radiant dawn. Suddenly, Dr. Marquez stops and takes you aside. “We may be able to use this as leverage. Rebecca is living proof of Mother Rachel’s hypocrisy, as horrible as that sounds. Everyone on Hemlock Isle will be at the Feast tonight. If we ask Rebecca to tell them what Mother Rachel said to her, we may be able to sway at least some of them to leave. And if that doesn’t work, we can high-tail it back to the mainland and get the law involved.”\n"
"The professor turns to Rebecca. “Can we play a game? Like last night? Your mother told me she wants you to hide until the Feast.” The young girl nods. Dr. Marquez lets out a manic giggle: strangely out of character for her usual controlled affect. You can’t help but suppress a grin, too, despite the horrors you just witnessed."
