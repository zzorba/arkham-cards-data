"The path to North Point Mine runs through a narrow ravine in the heart of Pearl Ridge. With little to go on, you asked around the Vale for more information about the mine, but all you could gather were several conflicting accounts. People have gone missing in the mines recently, although the mining operation is purportedly shut down. The lichens and moss are supposedly nutritious, but some are lethal? Nobody explained why the mine shut down in the first place, either.\n"
"The path ends at the mouth of a yawning cave. Following an old rail track in, you find heaps of abandoned equipment overgrown with bright yellow fungi. The fungus looks far from edible, and emits a putrescent stench. Eventually, the tunnel opens into a massive cavern filled with luminescent mushrooms and towering crystal formations. The ground shifts with a slight tremor, followed by an echoing cry from deeper in the mine. Steeling yourself, you trek deeper into the cave. At the very least, Dr. Marquez will want samples of the strange overgrowth on the rusted equipment."

You describe the cave-in at the entrance, and the present danger. “None of it matters,” she says stonily, but eventually relents. As you lead her to the cart, you turn and see a round, humanoid shape outlined against the incandescent pool. It flits quickly behind a rock."

msgid "As the mine cart judders over a rickety bridge, you notice a small figure dangling from the edge of a precipice. Acting on instinct, you lean down the lip of the mine cart and catch the figure by the forearm as you hurtle past. As you pull him into the cart, you recognize him as Simeon, chief mischief-maker of the Vale. He brushes himself off, cheeks white as paper. “I was looking for my stash. All part of the p—” he wheezes, then gives up. “Thanks for saving me. I don’t know what I would’ve done without you.”"

msgid "“Fancy seeing you here,” River stands as you approach. They hold a woven basket filled to the brim with phosphorescent mushrooms and blood-red lichens. “I have quite the discerning palate, let me tell you. Eugénie Brazier herself said that I was the most demanding patron to grace her table. These are exquisite,” they inhale from their basket luxuriously, then gesture at the grim tunnel. “The things we do for love.” You offer to help them forage; after all, Dr. Marquez will want samples of the unusual growths."
