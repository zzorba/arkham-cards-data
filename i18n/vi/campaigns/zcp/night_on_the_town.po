"Hibbs stares as you wolf down a plate of greasy breakfast food. The burly man takes a moment, then speaks:\n"
"\"It started about three days back. These strange fogs started rolling through town. Arkham being what it is, most people just assumed something had gone wrong at a factory downriver and went about their business. But then folks started getting sick. Gave folks weird rashes, some sort of disgusting skin thing. Folks by then were starting to get a bit wary, but business kept up.\n"
"Then, yesterday, Doc Pickman wandered into Providence Square with a deer's head fused to his neck. Both heads were screaming.\n"
"Government types showed up to put a stop to it, but the word was out. By the time we realized the mists were spreading from folks who were badly infected, the suits had already let a lot of troops get too close. Now there's a bunch of those things wandering around town. Attacking people. And even more of that terrible miasma.\n"
"The word on the street is to hole up somewhere safe tonight. Lots of folks practically live here at my roadhouse, so I thought I'd open up and let em gather. Honestly, though, I'm worried how much we'll be able to defend the place.\" Hibbs quiets for a beat, thinking.\n"
"\"You seem like hardy people, friend. If you're really concerned about the monsters, best thing you can do is help get folks safe. Arkham's full of places where people might be holing up. If you could round people up and help to shore up some safe havens... well, tomorrow, I'm sure there'll be plenty of folks happy to help you figure out your memory lapse.\""

"Things are getting bad out there. You had hoped that your experiences in the facility were exceptional, but it seems as though all of Arkham is swiftly moving in the same direction. It's possible that no matter what action you take to keep people safe, it won't be enough against the spreading tide of miasmic corruption.\n"
