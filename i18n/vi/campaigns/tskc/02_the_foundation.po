"“Talk,” the woman commands.\n"
"“I’m a detective with the ICPC,” Flint barks back. “Flint, Li Flint. And you’re going to be in a lot of trouble when they hear about this.”\n"
"“I assure you, I will not. And you?” she asks, glaring in your direction. You explain that you are independent investigators working with Flint. She takes a moment to read your gaze—presumably to tell if you are lying. She, like Flint, seems low on trust. Finally, after a long, bated moment, she holsters her firearm. Flint’s hands drop to his sides. You let out a breath you didn’t know you were holding.\n"
"“We have been after that red-gloved man for quite some time. This is the first time we have gotten this close. He seems to have a knack for slipping away.” She nods to the two suits flanking her—a tall, athletic, pale-skinned woman and a sharp, clean-shaven man—and motions toward the walls. They keep a hand on their holsters as they scour the perimeter of the room.“And who is ‘we,’ exactly?” Inspector Flint asks. You’ve been wondering the very same thing. Your interrogator has a British accent, but she doesn’t seem to be part of any local outfit you’ve ever heard of.\n"
"She waits for confirmation from her two subordinates before continuing. “All clear, ma’am,” the man states. She sighs and crosses her arms. “All right. What I am about to tell you cannot leave this room under any circumstances. Am I clear?”\n"
"Flint shrugs. “Under penalty of what, exactly?”\n"
"“Summary execution,” she states without hesitation. Your throat closes tight. Even your partner flinches for a moment.\n"
"“Well then. I suppose we don’t have much of a choice, do we?” He glances at you. You nod; you might as well hear what she has to say.\n"
"“I am Commissioner Taylor, and these are agents Hudson and Antonova. We are with the <minicaps>Foundation</minicaps>, an international agency devoted to the discovery, research, and containment of objects with paradimensional capability.”\n"
"“What kind of baloney?” Flint practically laughs. But the woman who calls herself Taylor shows no sign of humor.\n"
"“After the Great War, many treaties and accords were signed. Paris. Versailles. But keeping the peace wasn’t the only goal. There were… oddities, you see. During the war. Things that did not add up. The Foundation’s purpose is to find these ‘things that do not add up’ and ensure that they cannot be used for such purposes ever again.”\n"
"“Well, this is a hell of a con you buttons have cooked up,” Flint says, but the darker tone in his voice indicates he doesn’t even believe himself. And you’re inclined to agree—the fact that Commissioner Taylor even knows of the Red-Gloved Man at all is proof that she has inside knowledge.\n"
"You decide that it’s more likely she is telling the truth than lying, and ask what she intends to do with you.\n"
"She paces in uncomfortable silence before finally letting out a sigh. “Well, I certainly can’t have your investigation running parallel to my own. And you might have information that could be pertinent to our work. So I say we work together.”\n"
"“Work together? Or work for you?” Flint asks pointedly, his eyes narrowing.\n"
"She allows herself a smile. “You are a clever man, I’ll give you that.” She nods to Agent Hudson, who produces several badges and hands them to you. “You’ll be your own cell of the Foundation, operating under our authority, but with independence. All you need to do is agree to report your findings to us.” She locks eyes with Flint appraisingly. “You’ll be our point of contact.”\n"
"You ask Taylor what you get out of the arrangement, besides the lifted threat on your lives. “We’ll hand over the intel we have on the organization the Red-Gloved Man works for and provide travel papers that can get you anywhere in the world, no questions asked, at no expense.”\n"
"Flint eyes the badge like one might an explosive, turning it over and over in his hands. “Two minutes ago you were pointing a gun at me, now you’re offering me a job?”\n"
"“Yes. Well? Are you in?”\n"
"You pull Flint aside to speak with him in private. The discussion is short and hushed, full of conjecture and paranoid theories about this “Foundation” and their true motives. But in the end, you decide to accept her offer. If it will help you get to the bottom of whatever is going on, it is the only real choice.\n"
"“Very well then,” Taylor explains. “The Red-Gloved Man is just one operative of his organization. Or, perhaps, its leader—that we are unable to determine. They call themselves the <minicaps>Red Coterie</minicaps>, so named due to the red garments they wear. They are after artifacts scattered across the world which possess paradimensional capabilities—the very same kind of objects we seek to find and contain. We call them Keys.”\n"
"You ask Commissioner Taylor what she means by the term paradimensional. “Imagine a cake with many layers,” she explains. “Everything we see and feel exists on one layer. But there are many more layers above and below ours. Something that is paradimensional exists on one layer, but draws energy from other, parallel layers. As a result, these Keys operate outside the laws of our dimension. Cause and effect. If left unchecked, they can be used to inflict terrible harm on the world. Our job—your new job—is to get them out of the hands of the Coterie and keep them secure in Foundation custody.”\n"
"If these Keys are as powerful as the Foundation believes, you agree that they should be kept in safe hands. But you cannot help but wonder what this has to do with the disappearances you’ve been investigating, if anything. Flint locks eyes with you and gives you the slightest shake of his head. He has no intention of telling them."

"You decide it’s best to tell Commissioner Taylor why you were looking into the Red-Gloved Man to begin with. Flint lets out an audible sigh. She mulls it over for a few moments, then shakes her head. “That is something to look into, but your primary objective is to acquire the Keys the Coterie is searching for, at all costs. Am I understood?” Taylor further explains that she will forward any relevant information to Flint’s office, with some “sensitive details” omitted, of course. She will also provide the ICPC with the requisite papers regarding Flint’s new “position.”\n"
"“Oh, and Agent Flint,” she says on her way out, addressing him by his new title. “Your cell may have the independence to act on their own accord, but do not forget that you report directly to me. I expect you to do so without reservation should you discover anything of import.”\n"
"He nods, only the slightest hint of resistance giving him away."

"The next morning, your “cell” meets at the tea room near Trafalgar Square where you had originally intended to meet the previous night. Together, you go over the documentation provided to Flint by this “Foundation.”\n"
"“It’s all a bit difficult to believe, if I’m being honest,” Flint says, “but everything checks out. The travel papers, the job transfer, all of it. Not even my boss questioned it for a moment. I guess we’re secret agents now, eh?”\n"
"You agree; unbelievable as it might seem, it’s no less strange than the matters you had already been looking into. “Right. Well, I think the best thing to do is to split up. Shanghai is where I grew up. I have connections there I can leverage. So I’ll head there first. Where you want to investigate next is up to you. Meet up with me later, and we can figure out where to go from there.”"

"Whenever you <b>embark</b>, you may travel wherever you wish using the map included in <i>The Scarlet Keys</i> campaign expansion. Each space on the map is connected to one or more other spaces by paths. When you are ready to embark, travel along the paths to reach whichever destination you wish (as a group). For each path you use to reach your destination, you must mark 1 <b>time</b> in your Campaign Log (to a minimum of 1).\n"
"At each space on the map, there is a number and letter combination that will guide you to a particular page in this Campaign Guide. You do not have to stop at every space you travel through; however, if you wish to stop traveling and see what is at that space, turn to the page of the Campaign Guide that matches the indicated number and follow the story text there. This might lead you to an interlude or to a scenario. There is no perfect path to follow, so follow your gut… just be wary of how much time you spend (see “Tracking Time” in Campaign Setup).\n"
"<i>For example: Shelley wishes to travel from Alexandria to Marrakesh. She first marks 1 <b>time</b> to use the path to Rome, but chooses not to stop there, and marks 1 more <b>time</b> to travel to Marrakesh, where she stops. Marrakesh is marked as “11–B,” so she opens the Campaign Guide to page 11 and reads File #11–B: Dead Heat.</i>"
