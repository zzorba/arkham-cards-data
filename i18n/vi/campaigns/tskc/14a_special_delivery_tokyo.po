"Soon after arriving in Tokyo, you wander the city’s winding streets in the rain before sitting down at a food stall. Before you can order, a figure in a trenchcoat and wide-brimmed hat sits down next to you and whispers a phrase in a crisp British accent: “Six lions prowl at dusk.”\n"
"The phrase’s significance dawns on you after a moment, and you hurriedly recite the callback the Foundation operatives taught you: “A pride feasts in darkness.” The person next to you lowers the wide brim of her coat to reveal herself as Commissioner Taylor. She orders ramen for you both and looks away. “Before you ask: No, this is not a coincidence, and no, I will not tell you how I knew you would be here. It is my job to know more than you.”\n"
"You tell her she seems as brusque as usual, and a faint smile tugs at the edge of her lips. “Familiarity breeds liability, so let us keep this professional. Tell me what you have learned so far.” You shoot a worried look at the crowd around you. The commissioner shakes her head. “I saw to it that you were not followed. Talk.” Your eyes wander to the gun holstered to her belt, and you wonder what lengths she went to in the name of privacy.\n"
"Digging into the steaming bowl of ramen, you recount your findings so far. The rain falls hard around you, mingling with the smell of grilled meats and sweet spices. You spy a flash of red in the crowd, but when you look, all you see is the reflection on a blood-red fan. The commissioner snaps her fingers and you continue. Once you finish your report, Taylor pays for the meal and stands.\n"
"“It sounds as though your efforts are, shall we say, adequate?” she says primly. “However, the Foundation has a request. We need you to deliver a package to our sanctum in Lagos. Please see that it is delivered safely.” She hands you a sheaf of documents bound with cord."
