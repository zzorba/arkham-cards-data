msgid "You descend down miles of steep, cold stone. The tunnels are chokingly narrow at first, filled with rubble and detritus. Finally, you reach level ground, and the cavern’s true nature reveals itself before you. It is as though there were an entire world below the surface; the cavern’s ceiling is like a stone curtain of sky above you. Even more vast and terrifying are the endless depths below you, beyond the edges of stone chasms and archaic bridges. On all sides, this underground realm seems to extend beyond the boundary of your sight; you wonder just how far it reaches. Perhaps the entirety of the known surface of the Earth is but the top layer of another world…"

msgid "You awaken, lying on rough stone in a place much colder and deeper than before. You stand and take stock of your surroundings, noting the red glow that seems to emanate from the cavern to your left. You follow it for several minutes, until finally it leads you into a well-lit entryway, filled with stone pillars. At the far end of the room lies an ornate and elaborately decorated doorway, a stone disc that has been rolled aside to unveil the hellish realm beyond."

msgid "“Finally! Yoth, cavern of the serpents! The cursed ones, who fled the destruction of Valusia!” Alejandro examines the entryway with wonder in his eyes, arms raised in exultation. You know not of what he speaks, and you are beginning to grow worried. Just then, something scutters behind you, and a sound like the click-clacking of a claw catches you by surprise. Emerging from the darkness behind you are several alien creatures, the likes of which you have never seen: ten feet tall, with conical bodies that end in four strange appendages of varying lengths. “There you are,” Alejandro says calmly. One of the creatures responds by clicking its claws against one another in a deliberate pattern. “Take their minds,” Alejandro commands the creatures. “We have no further use for them.” It is your last human memory."

msgid "Before you are able to cross into the next layer of the cavern, a sound like the click-clacking of a claw catches you by surprise. Emerging from the darkness behind you are several alien creatures, the likes of which you have never seen: ten feet tall, with conical bodies that end in four strange appendages of varying lengths. You are stunned to see a human figure standing at the head of the group: none other than Alejandro Vela. “Take their minds,” Alejandro commands the creatures. “We have no further use for them.” It is your last human memory."
