Your old boss still jokes about you. Even if Tillinghast could get you the job, nobody back there respects you. You're looking at a life of grunt work, pal.\" You finish your meal in silence as you ponder their words. Your old colleagues might not respect you, but with Tillinghast's connections, you could make them fear you. A few bribes, well-timed threats— even a call from the mob — might put them in their place. It's not exactly above-board, but if you play the cards right, you could oust your former employer. You have the rest of the expedition to plan your move once you get back to Arkham."

If you skim a few extra relics on the side, maybe swipe some notes and photos of the ancient city, he promised double what Tillinghast would pay, maybe even more.\n"
