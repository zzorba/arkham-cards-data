"The scattered paths of Wonderland offer no more safety or direction than its wilderness.  Whether the roads have always been tangled or whether Gurathnaka has twisted the dream land is unclear, but you keep up your trek regardless.  At a crossroad at the edge of a large patch forest, you stop to consider carefully, only for the Cheshire Cat to appear once more on a branch above you.  \"I remember this spot well,\" he purrs, sweeping both his front paws to either side, \"In that direction lives a Hare, and in the other lives a Hatter, both quite mad.\"  You give an exasperated sigh.  Most of the citizens of Wonderland have been more than a little unhinged, but for the cat to make a note of these two speaks to just how crazy they might be.  \"They are likely to be at the hare's house, as it is nearly tea time.  Then again, it is always nearly tea time with those three.\"  The cat fades away once more before you can get any more details.  You puzzle over the cat's words carefully.  Tea for three, but he only mentioned the hare and hatter.  You expect it was the cat's way of guiding you to the third figure while maintaining its cryptic madness.\n"
"You follow the weaving road toward the Hare's house, unsure of what to expect.  The path veers off into the woods, but very quickly dead ends in a small cottage.  The house looks uninhabited, but the sounds of laughter and clinking of china lead you around to a side garden.  A long table stretches out across much of the small garden, stacked high with tea cups and pots, bread and butter, and all other manner of refreshments.  The Hare and the Hatter sit across from one another, conversing loudly, though their words seem like complete gibberish to you.  In the center of the table, a Dormouse peeks out of a teapot, disheveled and looking quite exhausted.  He looks up with drooping eyelids as you approach, looking as though he had something important to say but quite forgot it.  Before you can greet each other, the Dormouse's eyes close and he sinks back into the teapot with a long sigh.\n"
"All at once, as the Dormouse sinks to sleep, shadows sweep in from the edges of the garden.  You leap into one of the chairs, only for the Hare and Hatter to turn their attention to you with offended expressions.  \"No room, no room!\" they chide, seemingly oblivious to the encroaching darkness.  You brace for the wave of shadows, but instead, you feel a flutter in your stomach as your chair rises into the air.  The table and other chairs follow in short order, rising just above the consuming darkness.  \"It's very rude to sit down without being invited, you know!\" the Hare continues.  The Hatter nods in agreement before chiming in.  \"But since you're here, try to guess this riddle, if you can!\"  You nod half-heartedly at the tea party hosts as you begin to figure your way out of this dilemma."

"For this scenario, most locations are much smaller than average.  Only one investigator or enemy can occupy a [[Chair]] location at once.  Investigators cannot enter [[Chair]] locations that are occupied by another investigator or enemy.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may swap positions with other investigators and enemies using the abilities listed below.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n"
"Because of these restrictions, investigators at [[Chair]] locations are considered to be engaged with each non-aloof enemy at each connecting [[Chair]] location.  Players may engage, attack, evade, parley, and activate effects as if those enemies were at their location.  Enemies may also attack and activate effects as if they were at the engaged investigators' locations.  After an enemy enters a [[Chair]] location, it engages all investigators at all connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Failed attacks against enemies engaged with multiple investigators do not deal damage to other investigators.  If an investigator moves while engaged with any amount of enemies at [[Chair]] locations, those enemies make attacks of opportunity normally, but do not move after attacking.  If an investigator or enemy would move to an investigator's location via a card effect, move them to the nearest empty [[Chair]] location instead.\n"
"When an enemy would move between two [[Chair]] locations, but its path is blocked by another enemy or an investigator who did not trigger this movement, swap its position with that other enemy or investigator.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n"
"Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may commit cards to skill tests performed by investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at your location may target investigators or enemies at a connecting [[Chair]] locations instead.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at connecting or other locations are unchanged.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may interact with cards in the threat areas of investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.\n"
"Investigators may take the following two actions at any time during the scenario:\n"
"[action] If you are at a [[Chair]] location: <b>Move</b>.  Swap positions with an investigator at a connecting [[Chair]] location.  This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the other investigator.\n"
"[action] If you are at a [[Chair]] location: <b>Parley</b>.  Swap positions with an enemy at a connecting [[Chair]] location."

Just when it seems certain that the end is upon you, the shadows freeze.  You are suspended for a moment before they recede suddenly, sliding off of you like water.  The darkness evaporates, leaving you in one of the tea party chairs once more.  The Hare and Hatter are nowhere to be seen, no trace of them remaining.  Mere feet away, the shadows condense around the Dormouse who is fast asleep once more, but whimpering and kicking as his nightmares overwhelm him.  There is no chance to save the poor creature, and you retreat from the garden before you are caught up in the shadows' embrace again."

"\"An excellent riddle!  Let's have another!\"  The exclamation snaps you out of your thoughts, and you turn to see the Hare and Hatter still seated around the table, sipping tea and smiling congenially.  You keep your distance, remembering how they behaved during the earlier chaos, but they act as though nothing had happened.  \"Come now, a bright guest like you can surely think of a riddle we haven't heard before!\" the Hare invites, bounding over to escort you to a closer chair.  Your thoughts jumble and your words stumble, but your recent experience inspires a question.  When can you be in the dark and in the light at the same time?  The duo scratch their chins and tap their spoons idly, spending several seconds in thought.  Finally, the Hare draws upward and raises a finger.  \"When it's day out, but you've no idea what's going on!\" he proudly proclaims.\n"
"\"No, no!  It's quite the opposite!\" the Hatter scoffs, \"When you know exactly what is going on, but it's dark all around!  After all, it was pitch black only a moment ago and we knew precisely what happened!\"  You raise an eyebrow at the suggestion that they were aware of the danger the entire time.  The Hatter pulls you closer and lowers his voice to a whisper that's somehow louder than his speaking voice.  \"Everyone is mad here, you know.  The things that make sense, well, those belong in Alice's world.  And the shadows are rather picky.  Why, poor Dormy here started making sense and they went after him just like that!\"  You press the two mad partygoers further, and to your surprise, they divulge plenty of details about Gurathnaka and his brood.\n"
"The Dormouse gives a long sigh and smiles faintly as he continues waking up fully.  \"They may be mad, but friends are friends.  I'm quite surprised - and happy, mind you - that you didn't give them a thrashing for their trouble.\""

"The sound of labored sobbing rouses you from your thoughts, and you look down toward the end of the table to see the Hare trying to rouse the corpse of the Hatter with a fresh cup of tea.  \"It isn't all that bad, is it?  Darjeeling, you knowâ€¦ it really isâ€¦\"  He collapses down into his chair, and soon all sounds of crying fade.  The Hare sits motionless with a pained face, staring off into the distance, pupils twitching slightly.  The loss of his companion seems to have cracked the Hare's mind entirely.\n"
"The Dormouse shakes his head pityingly as he looks to the Hare.  \"Poor fellow.  They were inseparable, you know, even in the midst of all this madness.\"  He looks up at you with a mix of resentment and acceptance on his face.  \"Do make their sacrifice count.  There is plenty of work ahead, and it all hinged on your survival here.\""

"The sound of pitiful wailing snaps your mind back to the present, and you look down toward the end of the table to see the Hatter wringing his hat in his hand as he looks over the corpse of the Hare.  \"You don't know the answer, do you?  Wellâ€¦ well here's an easier one!  You'll guess itâ€¦ in no timeâ€¦\"  He stands for only a moment longer before he collapses into his chair, murmuring nonsensical riddles to himself.  The loss of his companion seems to have cracked the Hatter's mind entirely.\n"

"You take your time recovering, scanning around the table as you wait.  There are no signs of any of the tea party guests, least of all the Hare or Hatter.  The mad pair attacked you repeatedly during the chaotic event, and you had to defend yourself.  If you hadn't survived the ordeal, then Alice's mind may have been lost forever, and the two of them with it.\n"
"The Dormouse stands on the table, looking at each empty seat and sighing wistfully.  \"If only it hadn't come to this,\" he states with a sorrowful tone, \"and if only they'd been more helpfully mad.\"  The Dormouse turns to you as his expression hardens.  \"The shadows must be cast out of Wonderland, or events like these will happen again.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Another ordeal behind you and many more to go.  The Dormouse clambers onto your shoulder as you depart the tea party garden.  \"Wonderland is disorganized, more than usual,\" your new companion explains, \"and you will need my help in sorting through it all.  Should your own thoughts become similarly cluttered, I shall help sort them out as well.\"  You shake your head in disbelief that you would be grateful for the help of a talking mouse, but here in Alice's dreams, anything that doesn't intend to be your enemy is already a great help."
