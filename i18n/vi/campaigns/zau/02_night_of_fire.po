"Tired, beaten, broken, you collapse to the ground. In the distance, the funeral pyre of your home still burns, lighting up the night. With the figures pursuing you endlessly, and the nightmarish creatures accompanying them, you can only assume that you'll shortly be going down with your ship. \n"
"That said, you've been lying here a while now, and no-one's come to put one last bullet into you. With Herculean effort, you pull yourself to your feet, only to find the streets around you... empty. There are still rattles of gunfire in the distance - your pursuers finding a new target, perhaps?"

msgid "With the fall of the creature leading your pursuit, the rest of your hunters vanish into the night. The body you are left with quickly dissolves, leaving a brown sludge that someone whose night had been less traumatic might mistake for soil. Someone, or something, must have sent this monster after you. But who, and why?"
