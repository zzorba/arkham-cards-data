"“…You must be their friends,” the enigmatic voice says from above. To your surprise, the quiet voice belongs not to a person, but to a black cat that lounges lazily across a tree branch hanging over the path outside the hospital. “Oh, pick your jaws up off the ground and listen.” The cat rises and leaps onto the top of a nearby fence, walking along it with the kind of grace only cats possess.\n"
"“It is one of the cats of Earth’s Dreamlands,” Randolph proclaims, his voice tinged with merriment, like he was meeting an old friend for the first time in ages. “How long it has been since I have spoken with one of your kind!”\n"
"The cat’s piercing yellow eyes glare at Randolph for a moment before it returns its gaze to you. “…Sure. In any event, I bear a message from your dreaming friends.”"

You’re the only ones who can destroy the great web. Forget about your companions and descend into the pitch. It’s the only way. I’ll try to keep your friends safe while you fulfill your task.

My pet human, Virgil, is one of them. Yes, that Virgil. I see the looks on your faces. They’re also with another dreamer, a man named…hey, wait a minute.” The cat glares suspiciously at Randolph, then yawns. “Huh. You know what? Never mind. I have to check on something.” With that, the cat suddenly departs."

The eye of chaos is watching them. You’ve got your work cut out for you, but you also might be their only hope.” The black cat hops down from the fence and starts to walk away. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d better get back to your friends before they all get themselves killed.”"

There’s a grand conspiracy at work here, and you’re the only ones who can stop it. The best thing you can do is forge onward, for both your sakes. Don’t worry, I’ll stick around for a while. Someone’s gotta keep you alive.”"
