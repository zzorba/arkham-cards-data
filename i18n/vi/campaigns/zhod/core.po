Seeing his father in danger, the chief's son rushed to his aid, killing the Swede with a spear in the back. Panic-stricken, the whole tribe fled the station, escaping the reprisals of the dead captain's crew. The chief's son became delirious a few weeks later, talking about a shadow coming to take him. He died of a strange and devastating disease shortly after.\n"
