msgid "To better understand our future, we must first understand our past. It didn’t take long for the reports of Miskatonic University’s failed expedition to the jungles of Mexico to reach your ears. Stories of step pyramids, mythical serpent-people, and otherworldly artifacts in places previously thought uninhabited have piqued your interest. It didn’t take you long to pack your bags and make plans to head down and investigate it yourself. The Miskatonic University expedition made it into the ruins but struggled to make any progress. Your heart races as you begin to consider what other forgotten treasures lie undiscovered in the heart of the tomb."

"With a lash of your whip you swing over the final gap, and a quick roll gets you under the closing stone door before it seals behind you. You rise to your feet, looking out over the jungle before you, breathing the humid air once more. Checking your gear one last time, you see a scaly, serpentine stowaway has found its way into your bag. Grabbing it behind the head, you toss it softly into the grass and watch as it slithers away with a hiss.\n"
"You’ll have to be satisfied with what you’ve learned, and what you’ve found, in the Ruins of Eztli. Time to put the jungle behind you."

"You race down the ruined corridor, the hissing of pursuing snake monstrosities echoing off the stone behind you. Your path leads you to a deep pit, and you are faced with a choice: try to cross the gap, or turn around to face your pursuers. You reach to your belt and retrieve your bullwhip, deciding to use it to cross the chasm. You lash the whip at an exposed tree root near the ceiling, and start your swing.\n"
"With a heart-wrenching crack, the root snaps under your weight and you plummet into the chasm. You bounce off of sharp rocks as you tumble down, eventually landing in a shallow stream at the bottom. You spit blood, and then look up to see the eyes of the serpent-people peering down at you from far above, before they retreat back the way they came.\n"
"You struggle to stand, and consider the stream at your feet. You stumble along, following its path, hoping it will eventually lead you out."
