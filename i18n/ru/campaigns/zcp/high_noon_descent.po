msgid "You search the various back rooms. In the cellar, behind shelves of booze, you find a hatch that leads down to a familiar tunnel. It seems Hibbs was lying to you."
msgstr ""

msgid "You swiftly descend into the tunnel- So swiftly that you're caught off guard when Tailor agents surround you and demand you drop any weapons. A man with the grin of a hungry shark lights a cigarette and smiles. \"Welcome to the Brook facility. Any last words?\""

"\"Stand down, Crispin! We're on the same side here. These are undercover Tailors. They've been working for me, doing surveillance.\" Greyson positions herself between you and the scowling man.\n"
"\"And how come I ain't heard about this before?\"\n"
"\"We're a clandestine organization, Crispin. Need-to-know basis. I don't need you to like it. I just need you to give us time to get down there and help West here do his job.\"\n"
"After a tense moment, the agents stand down. Greyson pulls you past, and walks you and West into the facility lobby. \"Don't thank her too soon\" West interjects. \"We've got maybe a half an hour before they realize she's lying to them.\""

"West frowns. \"You came to me to for a solution to all this? Well, I don't have one. I deal with life and death - what's going on up there is beyond either. Pickman would have known, but he's out of the picture. But we had a mutual associate here. Robison. Dealt in knowledge of the arcane. I would consider the man a crackpot, but for his results. The board funded his research into beings that supposedly offered him knowledge. He once bragged to me that he could learn the answer to any question for the right price. If we could reach his private laboratory, you could force him to make good on that boast.\n"
"Unfortunately, the man was… paranoid. His research wing is protected by a complex series of locks and barriers. Fortunately, I know where at least one key can be found.\"\n"
"You express your confusion to West. Research wing? You saw no research wing, and you fully explored this facility yesterday.\n"
"\"Oh, did you?\" says West, pushing a wall panel in and revealing a pristine panic room stocked with supplies. \"Well, you're the experts.\""

"Your mind rests in the trench between idleness and slumber. You feel the cold stone beneath you. You chance the opening of an eye, and see only the cold void of space.\n"
"You bolt upright, and are astonished by what you see. You lie upon one of a seemingly infinite number of narrow interweaving pathways through a terrifying nothingness dotted with stars.\n"
"All around you, terrible voices chant softly, and you strain to hear. \"Ia! Ia! Yog-Sothoth!\" You realize, with some concern, that the little dots on the horizon are not stars. They are eyes.\n"

"Your eyes unfocus as you are pulled through what seems like an endless stretch of solid concrete. An eternity passes, the only sensation being the hand pulling you forward.\n"

"\"Welcome to my Master's realm.\" A thin man in a tattered collared shirt and glasses standing ahead of you on the narrow path nods slightly. \"I'm Dr. Robison. I think you've been looking for me? So, I've been looking for you. Come, and I'll explain what I know.\""
