"You struggle to follow the pace of the little girl as she skips and hops towards the small town. \"My name is Maja. My directive is to store and manage the information archives on the ship.\" She hastily explains that a few of her classmates and her were kidnapped from their school by the 'bad people' on January 16th, 2045. Their brains were surgically removed and preserved in a special experimental machine that eventually became the powerful supercomputer operating the Tatterdemalion, K2-PS187.\n"
"As you walk through the town, it becomes clear that something horrible has happened here. Everything appears to be in disarray, as if a riot has recently passed through. Freshly-painted yellow graffiti depicting strange symbols and hieroglyphs can be seen. Everywhere are splatters of blood, spent shell casings, and pale face masks. There are no bodies, but you can hear the sound of distant screams, gunshots, and sirens coming from beyond the streets. Nearby is an overturned police car and a black box truck lying on its side. Huge claw marks have torn into the metal of the truck and its rear doors hang open. As you walk past, a radio from within crackles and sputters, then blares, “Hello, Unit 12? Unit 12, is that you? Please respond.\" Maja clarifies that this virtual environment that represents K2-PS187's dreams takes the form of the day they got captured, the day the entire world ended. What could possibly have happened on Earth in the distant future? Or rather, the distant past?\n"
"You finally arrive outside of a large brick building. Maja halts and gestures towards it. \"This is where my friends are hiding. The bad people made us translate a scary story and make a movie for them. We didn't want to read it, but they made us. A few days later, Annie, the universal translator, she -- she --\" Maja struggles to utter the words. There is a desperate fear in her eyes. \"You won't believe me, but I swear, it was the Boogeyman! I saw the Boogeyman eat her! I ran away and searched the archives to see if anything, anyone could help. After a long time, I finally found someone and called out to them. That's when you woke up! Now that you're inside our system, you can save us!\"\n"
"Before you is a path leading to a pair of double doors, above which are the words “Public School 187.” Underneath, someone has written “HASTUR RISES!” in yellow spray paint. An inhuman howl echoes through the halls inside the school, followed by children screaming in terror."

msgid "An overturned schoolbus gathers dust on the school grounds. As you examine the vandalized windows, you notice a glimpse of your own reflection. However, you no longer recognize the person looking back at you. The frame, the distinct facial features, they all seem so familiar to you, yet you know this is not your body. You stare into the glass in disbelief. The face of your reflection morphs into a blank, pale mask with no mouth, nose or eyes. The virtual reality no longer recognizes your residual self image anymore -- the mental projection of your digital self has decayed into nothingness."

"Throughout this scenario, you may be instructed to switch two locations with each other. When a location is switched with another location, they take each other's place in the arrangement. All tokens, attachments, investigators, enemies, and other cards at each location remain on the same location (they have “moved” with the location -- only the arrangement and connections have changed.)\n"
"<i>For example, if Wendy Adams is currently in the School Grounds and is instructed to switch her location with the Entrance Hall, which is directly above the School Grounds, the positions of the two locations will be switched. After switching these two locations with each other, Wendy Adams remains in the School Grounds, which is now directly above the Entrance Hall.</i>"

msgid "A roar of applause startles you awake. The crowd of the theatre rises to their feet, cheering endlessly. Several patrons in the front row are throwing roses to the actors on stage, who are bowing with wide smiles across their faces. A searing headache crawls through your temples. How did you get back here? Were you in the theatre all along? What about the spaceship? The virtual reality? Was it all just a terrible dream? Before you can get up and exit the auditorium, the lights flicker off. A spotlight shines onto the stage, illuminating a single actor, dressed up as a clown. Something must have gone wrong inside the simulation. You are no longer inside of K2-PS187's nightmare, but your own. Without outside interference, your body will likely be drifting in endless space forever, as your mind slowly decays in this rotten reproduction of reality. The stranger begins laughing. A horrible, ear-piercing laugh."

msgid "You wake up inside of a virtual classroom, surrounded by the children you rescued. The children themselves, who at first appeared dirty and disheveled, now appear clean and neat in school uniforms. They contained the insanity of the remaining children by creating a new pocket reality, disconnected from the system mainframe. The survivors mourn the loss of their friends, but are glad that there is no more Boogeyman to scare them and that there are no more bad people to tell them what to do. The virtual dreamscape is no longer a nightmarish hell it used to be."

msgid "Outside, the sun comes out and it appears to be a beautiful spring day. Inside, the halls are clean and orderly, with brightly painted pictures on the walls. The children themselves, who at first appeared dirty and disheveled, now appear clean and neat in school uniforms. They are overjoyed that the Boogeyman and all the bad people are finally gone. They understand that they can never return home and that their families are long dead. But that does not diminish their happiness that there is no more Boogeyman to scare them and that they have a real teacher to take care of them again. The virtual dreamscape is now filled with happy, loving children."
