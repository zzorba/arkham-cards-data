"\"Humanity's first contact with the extraterrestrials was in the early 21st century, when a lunar expedition stumbled upon a vast underground network of alien structures underneath the sea of regolith. The Greys, as humanity has come to know them, were under the guise of a curious species that came to our solar system to observe and probe the young civilization. The true purpose of their lunar activities have remained concealed for many years…\"\n"

"You look out the view ports and can see only dense, orange clouds for most of the descent. Only after the landing shuttle dipped into the troposphere that the clouds are thin enough for you to peer at the ground below — miles and miles of windswept dunes of methane snow, broken by knife-like volcanic ridges of icy stone, open craters belching “lava flows” of liquid water, ammonia, and methane that freeze into fantastic shapes as they pour down the slopes. You could never have dreamed of anything like the beauty and alien landscape of Titan.\n"
"The craft lands smoothly onto a flat slab of ice. After K2-PS187 confirms that this is the coordinates of the unusual \"business trips\" that the cultists were conducting, you suit up, open the hatch and step out into the harsh terrain. A large tunnel nestled between the orange cliffs greets you. A green glow pulsates from within, illuminating a strange figure, guarding the entrance…"

"Some cards may have the ability to seal one or more chaos tokens as part of their effect. This is done as follows: Search the chaos bag for the specified token, remove it from the chaos bag, and place it on the card. If the specified token is not in the chaos bag, the effect fails.\n"
"When a chaos token is “released,” it is returned to the chaos bag and is no longer considered sealed. <b>If a card with one or more chaos tokens sealed on it leaves play for any reason, any chaos tokens sealed on it are immediately released.</b>"

To perform such a skill test, simply add both indicated skills and reveal and resolve a chaos token, compare the modified skill value to the difficulty of the test. Such a test is considered to be a test of both skill types. Cards with either skill icon may be committed to the test, and both icons are considered matching skill icons. (Skill icons only contribute once for skill tests that involve additions of the same skill.)"

msgid "Flapping and screeching, you had no chance against the extraterrestrial swarm that descended onto Titan shortly after you have arrived. Fortunately -- it seems as though you were not their target. The alien facility has been ransacked and any clues you could have gleamed has been destroyed. At the very least, they left you alone. When the coast is finally clear of the flying monstrosities, you search through the ruins to find several golden disks of various radii. Aboard the Tatterdemalion, you fiddle with these disks and try to combine them in various orientations -- but they don't appear to have any use other than the value of the material itself. There is still much you don't know, and with resolve, you prepare for the next expedition."

A thorough search of the cargo hold reveals a stack of the golden disks that were exchanged during the transaction. You fiddle with them and try to combine them in various orientations -- but they don't appear to have any use other than the value of the material itself.
