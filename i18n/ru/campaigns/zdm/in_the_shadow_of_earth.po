"\"In the middle of the 21st century, Earth was in complete chaos. Rioting, crime, madness and worse had become the order of the day for the entire world. […] In a last ditch of effort, two of the Arks were completed and the third vessel was stripped for parts. The two completed vessels set out for Mars, each carrying 3000 humans in suspended animation. One vessel, the Liberty, suffered a massive power plant failure and the crew and passengers were killed. The other ship, Hope, eventually reached Mars…\"\n"

"The planet Earth — what used to be humanity's sanctuary, is now abandoned to the madness of the Ancient Ones. There is very little information of what remains on the Earth, but if anyone would attempt to send out a transmission, survey vessels stationed around the planet such as the Nostalgia II would hear those calls.\n"
"The trip itself was uneventful, and you spend your days watching the blue dot of Earth grow and grow in size. Around the time you can finally recognize a few of the continents, the Tatterdemalion picks up a lonely and distant beat — the echo of the Nostalgia II's distress beacon. You try to hail the crew with your radios, but there is no response. The Tatterdemalion begins its deceleration, and with no time to waste, you prepare to board the godforsaken ship."
