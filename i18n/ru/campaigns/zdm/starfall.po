msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is beyond doubt. The sun is experiencing an unprecedented acceleration in the decay of its hydrogen core. K2-PS187 estimates that there are only a few years left before the fusion reactions that fuel our star will run out of gas and collapse on itself, generating a radioactive supernova that will destroy all life within a few light years. Whatever the cultists have done within Fragment has doomed our solar system to a premature end.\n"
"Your only hope now is to convince the remainder of the various colonies of humanity of this accelerated death and help them gather the resources and technology necessary to survive the supernova in any way possible. K2-PS187 makes the preparations for the navigation console as you brace for the many-months long journey ahead of you travelling across the solar system to save humanity."

msgid "Perhaps there is another way. The ritual you've glimpsed in the halls of Tassilda's temple will take many months to prepare — and you still do not know where it must be performed, but if it is possible, it will surely give humanity enough time to develop the technology necessary to survive. Now to find the ritual site is another question altogether…"

msgid "After the blackout finally ended, you and your fellow companions left the underground shelters of Hope to witness a dazzling array of painterly gases, and a faint white sphere — the residual legacy of the sun. Colony researchers have claimed that it would have been impossible for the electromagnetic shield to protect the entire planet from the blast without the unexpected but embraced energy spike originating from the nearby alien ruins. It is the dawn of a new beginning for mankind, the age of the White Sun. You live the rest of your days helping the megapolis sustain itself and recounting the fantasy stories of your life on Earth. And yet you wonder, as you look up to the light of the white dwarf, how long until it too, inevitably decays and humanity will once more need to escape extinction…"

msgid "The scientists of Sinai activated the space-time warping device moments before the blast. The colony of New Brooklyn was jaunted along the folds of space time, towards a new galaxy, and a new future. The destination — a prospective binary system of many exoplanets — appears to be safe and far beyond the reach of the Ancient Ones of the old world. You live the rest of your days helping humanity build outposts under the virgin skies of a new home, a planet the settlers will call Paradise. You recount stories of your life on Earth to your descendants, stories that will become fairy tales and eventually legends. The inhabitants upon this new world live and work together in peace and prosperity. It is the dawn of a new beginning for mankind. And yet you wonder, as you look up to the light of your new stars, how long until they too, inevitably decay and humanity will once more need to escape extinction…"

msgid "The light of the supernova engulfs the skies and surrounds you and your companions. Despite all of your efforts, you could not redeem yourself and prevent the demise of humanity. In your finals moments, before the shockwave strips you of your corporeal essence, a figure in a tattered yellow dress materializes in the light. You kneel before her and grab onto her hand, as Tassilda welcomes you into the dark realm of Carcosa."

msgid "A roar of applause startles you awake. The crowd of the theatre rises to their feet, cheering endlessly. Several patrons in the front row are throwing roses to the actors on stage, who are bowing with wide smiles across their faces. A searing headache crawls through your temples. How did you get back here? Were you in the theatre all along? What about the Tatterdemalion? K2-PS187? Fragment? …the entire future? Was it all just a terrible dream? You exit the auditorium before the crowd rushes to do the same. Dizziness and exhaustion harries your senses. The weight of your lengthy adventure is crushing your mind. By the time you finally reach the lobby, you are clawing your way across the ground. The ground… Earth. You are finally home. A few of your thoughts wander towards the idea that this might be another simulation or a trick of the mind, but you don't care anymore. You can live with that. At least now, there is hope for a brighter future."

msgid "The Royal Princess of Carcosa succumbs to your assault and wastes away before you. You have defeated Tassilda, and in doing so have prevented the early collapse of the sun. Suddenly there is a horrific smell wafting down all around you, carried by a blast of chilly air. Before any of you can react, a dark cloud crackling with arcs of yellow and white energy expels from the sun, surrounding the entire ship. Within this cloud hovers a horrific creature. It is enormous, wrinkled, and hunched, with dozens of tentacles, each tipped with a wicked-looking fang. This can only be the being Tassilda spoke of, her sire, the Last King. In an instant, the great abomination begins crushing the hull of the ship inwards. In your final moments, despite being unable to save yourself from the blast, you feel accomplished — and redeemed — by what you have done to save the others."
