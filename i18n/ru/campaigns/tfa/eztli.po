"Our runners, José and Maria, returned several days later. They were fully stocked with food, water, aspirin, and weapons. I am curious how deep Alejandro’s connections are in Mexico. For an outcast historian, he was able to secure guns and ammunition faster than I had anticipated. But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\n"
"We ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple. Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?"

"We spent most of yesterday moving our camp to the edge of the ruins. With the serpentine creatures still guarding the region, we have decided that a small party will have the best chance of slipping into the main temple unnoticed. I told Maria, the expedition’s naturalist, to take one of the trucks and wait beyond the northern edge of the rainforest. Our cartographer, José, is guarding the camp until we return. We’re on our own, but at least we’ve cleared an escape route in the event things go sour..."

"The outside of the temple ruins appeared Aztec in origin, but once we breached the interior, it became clear that these buildings had a very different and inhuman origin. The ruins were alive. The grooves in the walls were illuminated as though powered by electricity, and a faint hum of energy reverberated throughout the halls. In spite of the serpent creatures, we were able to reach a hidden passage that led deeper underground.\n"
"In the central chamber of these underground halls, we found our prize: a steel orb of unknown origin, gently humming and glowing with a dim blue light. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance, and we knew it could not have been made by the Aztecs.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, we fled the ruins. The building had started to crumble around us, as though the orb was the only thing keeping it standing. Had it been powering the ruins, like a battery? What exactly was this device that the serpents guarded so fervently?\n"
"Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the rainforest. We’re getting the hell out of this serpent-infested jungle while we still can."

"It is not in my nature to leave a thing unfinished. For the sake of my fallen comrades, I have taken it upon myself to record the remainder of our expedition in this journal.\n"
"The others never made it out of the temple. I convinced two of the other members of the expedition, José and Andrea, to venture in after the others...But now I fear a terrible fate has befallen them, as well.\n"
"Thankfully, my gambit was worthwhile. While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\n"
"In the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device. The orb was made of an unnatural steel, attached delicately to its bronze frame. It pulsed with power in my hands and glowed with a dim blue light. Any fool could tell that it was not made by the Aztecs, but the other members of the expedition could not even begin to understand its true significance. The ruins started to crumble around me as I left, but it mattered not. The relic was all that mattered now.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, I returned to camp and told the others it was time to depart. Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. Now we are headed to Texas, where we will cross the border into the United States.\n"
"It is a shame what happened to the others. Their sacrifice will not be in vain. Now, my work can continue.\n"

"This was a mistake. This was all a terrible mistake. We escaped the temple with our lives, but not a moment too soon. The ruins were alive. It was as though the walls knew of our intrusion, hated us for our presence. Wanted us out. Wanted us dead.\n"
"We have gathered outside the temple where José is waiting for us. Alejandro, unwilling to return home empty-handed, wants us to go back inside. We must decide what to do next."

"We’ve made our decision. Alejandro is right: we’ve come too far to back down now. Our plan is to regroup and head back into the temple once more. Even from here, we can tell that the layout of the temple has warped and changed. The ruins seem to have reset to their dormant state. With any luck, we’ll make it out this time..."

"We made our decision. There was no way we were going back into that deathtrap. Thankfully, there was another way. José had brought some TNT from the trucks, and there was more than enough to level the damned place.\n"
"That night, we put on a hell of a fireworks show. The jungle protested. Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\n"
"José was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\n"
"Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City. Even now I do not feel safe: who could, after seeing what we have seen?\n"
"To hell with the Eztli and to hell with this forsaken place."
