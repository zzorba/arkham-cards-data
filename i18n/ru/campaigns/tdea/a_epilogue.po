Forces beyond your comprehension have been in conflict with one another far longer than what your kind (or, yes, even my kind) realize. They have long fought over the land of dreams, but there are many realities outside the Dreamlands, and only one entity can truly be the ruler of them all. I knew there was always a chance that this might happen. That we might fail. But in the end, at least I can say I tried. It's your fault, really, not mine.\""

They might not remember their dreams, but that does not mean they did not happen. Do you not see the glimmer in their eyes? Have you not noticed them whispering to some other entity when you are not around? Yes, that one. You know of whom I speak. Don't worry, you at least have some time before the end. Just remember: I did warn you.\""
