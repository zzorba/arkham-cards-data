"You are sitting in the small kitchen of the Peters family home in Akwan, on the north shore of Hemlock Isle. Cold Atlantic seawater laps at the stilts below the house as Helen Peters sets her steaming mug on the table. “The north shore caverns are a death trap,” she says firmly. “I don’t think you know what you’re getting into.”\n"
"You tell her you are well aware of the danger. According to local rumors, some folks have gone missing recently. The most recent disappearance was Helen’s sister, so you paid a visit to the Peters home to offer your help.\n"
"Helen looks you over, as if sizing you up, and finally nods. “Alright then. You’re either brave, or you’re stupid. Or you’re both, like my little brother.” She rubs her brow in frustration. “I last saw Lizzie—Elizabeth—taking a walk with our dog Bruce along the coastline. I told her to stay away from those caves, but she never listens. It’s easy to get lost in ‘em and there are things in there that’d haunt your nightmares.” She sets a flashlight on the table. “But that’s where we’re going to start.”"

"You follow Helen outside and onto the creaking boardwalks of Akwan village. Nestled in a small, rocky bay on the island’s northern shore, Akwan has been the home of Abenaki families and former whalers for generations. The steady swell and break of seawater on the stony shore lends the scene an eerie disquiet. Helen grabs a harpoon from a whaler’s shack and leads you to the beach.\n"
"A familiar old pickup truck slows to a stop nearby. Theo steps out and greets you with a broad smile. “I’m back! I had to run back to the Vale for something,” he waves. His smile vanishes when he sees Helen.\n"
"“I’m surprised you came,” Helen says cooly.\n"
"Theo looks crestfallen. “Of course I came, sis. How could I not?”\n"
"His sister says nothing as she strides past you both toward the bleak shoreline. A curl of waves crashes against the walk, breaking the apparent drama of the moment. You ask Theo for the reason behind his sister’s chilly response, and he looks distant for a moment.\n"
"“Y’know, sometimes people just grow apart. Like two branches. They’ll always be connected, but they—” The extended metaphor is interrupted by Helen, calling you to the mouth of a seaside cave."

"As you and Helen make preparations to leave, the sound of rain breaks the silence. Theo steps through the front door, brushing his wet hair out of his face. He locks eyes with Helen. “So she’s still not back,” he says soberly. Theo drips rainwater on the weatherbeaten floor as Helen glowers at him. “I’m surprised you came, little brother. Better late than never, I guess. Get the rope.” She slings a harpoon over her shoulder and walks out into the pouring rain. Theo scrambles for rope and a second flashlight as you ask him what the matter is.\n"
"“Our sister is missing. I told Helen she would come back, and now it’s been two days. That’s, uh. That’s what the matter is.”"

"You follow Helen outside and onto the creaking boardwalks of Akwan village. Nestled in a small, rocky bay on the island’s northern shore, Akwan has been the home of Abenaki families and former whalers for generations. “Hemlock Isle isn’t safe anymore. I thought this could be our home, but I guess it’s just another stop on the way,” Helen says wistfully. The village is all but deserted, save for an old sailor in a navy blue coat. He nearly drops his fishing rod as you approach.\n"
"“Gideon! Fishing again?” Helen says with a wry smile.\n"
"The old sailor pulls his haul out of the water. “Nae but an ugly cod. An’ this e’en uglier haddock.” The fish strung through the twine have too many fins and spined, barnacle-like growths. “An ye, Helen?” Gideon asks.\n"
"Helen tells the old sailor about her missing sister. The old sailor looks concerned. “Little Lizzie’s quite the treasure. I’ll help, if ye’ll have me.”"

msgid "You follow Helen outside and onto the creaking boardwalks of Akwan village. The night sky is dreary and overcast, but an unsettling glimmer lingers over the southern horizon: a distant, shifting luminescence of blues and greens beyond the treetops. The light forms familiar patterns: A lion’s paw, a spring blossom, a longship, and finally, a vague humanoid outline. You look down to see Helen disappearing into an inky black cave."

"William stands on the rocky shoreline looking out at the rolling surf and the distant Maine coastline beyond. “This poisoned isle is all that is left of the Hemlock name. My family’s legacy will end with me,” he says bitterly. Helen strides forward, her face livid. “This island belongs to no one; your legacy is dead. It was wild long before your family took it from nature, and now the wild will take it back.”\n"
"William’s lip trembles as he stares up at the glimmer. A rainbow band of iridescent colors warps the sky. “All good things are wild and free,” he quotes reverently. “Perhaps it’s time I accepted that.”"

Well I din’t lose it sumach as I buried it an’ forgot where it were, if ye get.” He prattles on about three other unrelated tales before circling back. “I weren’t so dull I buried it in the sand.

"As you and Theo follow Helen through yet another slimy tunnel, you emerge into a large room the size of an ampitheater. Branching coral and massive crustaceans grip the wet, dark rock around you, and for a moment, the group collectively holds their breath, taking in the unbelievable scene. “Let’s keep moving,” Helen says gruffly. She quickly outpaces you and Theo, and you take the moment to ask the young man more about his sister’s icy demeanor.\n"
"“She blames the Vale for...For, well, everything. A year ago, we were barely making ends meet in Akwan. She tried to get me to take up fishing, like my father, and—” he seems to choke on his words. “It’s not like I was ever any help. But when I visited the Vale, I felt like I had a place. Somewhere I belonged. Mother Rachel says—”\n"
"“Shut up,” Helen breaks into the conversation. “It’s bad enough Lizzie heard you talking up that loon when you were home. You wanna be her lap dog, go ahead. You wanna turn your back on us, go ahead. But don’t spout any of that bullshit around me.”\n"

I just want us to be a family.” Her tough exterior breaks as she begins to weep. After a moment, Theo looks at his sister, lip trembling, then wraps his arms around her in a wordless hug."

"You return to Akwan with Helen and Lizzie. The younger sister thanks you as she stares back at the caves. Helen takes the frayed dog leash from her. “Bruce was a good dog,” she says. The ocean wind blows the youngest Peters’ dark brown hair across her round face as Helen wraps an arm around her shoulder. You ask what their plan is now.\n"
"“We can’t stay here,” Helen says, more to Elizabeth than to you. Before her sister can protest, Helen goes on. “Remember the story Nokemes told us? The one about Gluskab turning a man into a tree. Everything on this island is wrong. It’s transformed into something deadly. Maybe it’s time we pay a visit to Uncle George in Portland.”"

"After returning from his truck, Theo asks his sister why she wandered off. Lizzie brushes tears from her eyes and holds up the torn dog leash. “Bruce wanted to go for one last walk. Like we used to.” Theo looks crestfallen as his two sisters look out to sea, past the rolling waves and the silver clouds. Theo hesitates, searching for what to say as his sisters face the crashing surf.\n"

"“I’ll start making preparations soon and hopefully we’ll be off the island in a few more days,” Helen tells you. “I suggest you leave soon, as well.” You tell her the survey is far from over, and there’s still more you have to do. Helen scoffs. “Your funeral,” she says, then after a brief silence she looks at you again. “Sorry. I don’t know why I said that,” she says. “Thank you for your help. Nobody from the Vale would have helped.” She looks down the black sanded shore toward Akwan. “Gideon used to fish here often, but not anymore. The Vale took him from us. Now they’ve taken Theo.”\n"
"She looks back to you. “I have another favor to ask. Please. Look after Theo. He means well, even if he’s a little thick in the head. Make sure he’s okay. No matter what he thinks, he’s still family.”"
