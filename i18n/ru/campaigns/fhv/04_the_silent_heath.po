msgid "Scenario: The Silent Heath"
msgstr ""

msgid "You step out of Theo’s truck accompanied by Leah Atwood and look up at Hemlock Isle’s highest point. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill with the Vale’s cook. “There’s a reason folks don’t live here anymore. Watch yourself up here. I don’t know what lives in the caves, and I don’t intend to find out,” she says. As if in response, a strong wind blows up clouds of white ash."

"You step out of Theo’s truck into the pouring rain, accompanied by Dr. Marquez. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill with the professor, who wears a bright yellow and blue poncho. “If the locals are to be believed, we want to head this way,” she points up the hillside to a glimmering orchard. After hiking the steep incline, the professor lets out a gasp.\n"
"Rows of crystalline trees shimmer in the light. A crack of lightning from the southern clouds refracts a band of gorgeous, prismatic radiance through hanging apples and knotted glass trunks. Although beautiful, you can’t help but feel an anxious pang: the trees are wondrous, but they are long dead, frozen in time. Dr. Marquez begins chipping away at a young sapling with a hammer and chisel. “Fan out and explore the ruins. Leah warned me to keep clear of the ants, whatever that means. Don’t kick any anthills, I guess.” she says, already engrossed in her work."

The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. A dread silence pervades everything as you walk up the hill and spot a robed figure standing on a jutting rock, staring down at Hemlock Isle. You recognize the figure as Mother Rachel as you draw closer. She nods as if to acknowledge your presence, then spreads her arms in an exultant pose. The sky overhead shimmers with a band of strange colors."

msgid "You step out of Theo’s truck and look up at Hemlock Isle’s highest point. The narrow winding road gives way to the soft, sand-like ash that blankets the heath: silvery and bright in the moonlight. The black rocks at the top of the hill look like jagged teeth. You feel strangely calmed by the silence as you walk up the hill, and see brilliant bands of color in the starlight overhead."

msgid "You reach the old Pearl Estate and stop yourself from walking into the yawning dark chasm in front of the dilapidated house. A shattered rooftop at the northern end of the estate tells a story of some violent impact: judging by the scattered boards, something shot out of the interior with the force of a cannonball. As you survey the ruins, you wonder what awful catastrophe befell the Pearl family. A skittering black shadow flits at the edge of your vision. When you turn to look, it has gone."

The air is sharp with a bitter, alkaline taste, mixed with a repugnant musky scent. Several dessicated corpses—some of them human—litter the floor, overgrown with salt. Perhaps the local creatures use the salt in this chamber as a natural preservative. A pantry, of sorts."

The belly of the son is swollen with crystals the size of a basketball, and the mother’s skin is leathery with salt. You don’t know what warped the bodies of the Pearl Family, but it surely wasn’t quick; they must have been horribly deformed when they died. You document the remains and a few samples of the crystal growths. The Pearl family deserved better than this. With a shovel from the back of Theo’s truck, you set to digging the three corpses a proper grave."

"Once you have left Pearl Ridge behind, you study Susan Pearl’s diary.

The business entries are interspersed with prayers, illustrations of birds, and occasional details on the strange “Warrens” underneath Pearl Ridge. Other entries mention spreading sickness in the orchard workers and the Pearl family, along with repeated hardship in their mining efforts. The last entry, written in a long, erratic scrawl, catches your attention:\n"
"<blockquote>I am still not certain if what I experienced was a dream or vision. At midnight, I awoke to the uncanny feeling of being watched, and when I opened my eyes, I saw a pale sphere of watery light in the corner of my room, dancing like something in a faery story. As soon as I laid eyes on it, the thing flew out the window, and I followed it out into the orchard. What I saw is something I can only describe as a miracle: A hundred more faery lights danced in the orchard. As I watched the lights, they grew brighter, and I felt almost as though I was flying. A heady bliss took over my mind, and I felt different, somehow. As if there were another me—five other me’s—beating within my chest. And as I looked out at the trees, I saw myself in them, too. In all of this. Strong and thick with knotted skin and branches for arms. I saw myself, my place, in all of creation. And all of my fears—for Ezra, for the mine, for our health—melted away. I knew only joy. Such joy!\n"

Persistent contamination has led to mineralization and crystallization of organic life. Local caverns overrun by a massive insect colony. Insects exhibited vespid and termitid behaviors and physiology. Further study needed.”"
