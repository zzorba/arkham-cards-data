msgid "You're tired. This isn't exactly surprising; you just fought a god. As you wend your way through the early-morning Arkham streets, though, you feel surprisingly light on your feet - if fatigue weighs you down, this feeling lifts you up, until you're practically floating. You feel yourself drift off, still walking, into a cozy, endless sleep..."

"\"Y-yes sir,\" he managed, \"Our trials were conclusive. We now only miss one component-\"\n"
"\"Not quite. Our new friends helped us with that as well.\" Eyes twinkling, Sanford produces a loose array of singed papers from his desk. \"After helping dispatch Baxter's operation, one of our agents recovered some of his research. We have everything we need.\n"
"\"Let the great work begin.\""
