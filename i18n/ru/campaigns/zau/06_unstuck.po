"\"With a sense of troublous familiarity, I beheld the blurred unstable pictures which flowed past me upon this never-resting medium. Orient temples, flashing with sun-struck bronze and gold; the sharp, crowded gables and spires of medieval cities; tropic and northern forests; the costumes and physiognomies of the Levant, of Persia, of old Rome and Carthage, went by like blown, flying mirages. Each succeeding tableau belonged to a more ancient period than the one before it â€” and I knew that each was a scene from some former existence of my own.\" \n"

"You fall. Though fall is maybe the wrong word - fall implies a sense of<i>down.</i> You tumble through realities, flashes of years long past and dizzying futures muddling your senses. You feel sick, faint, close to passing out. \n"
"A sudden stillness. You lie on solid ground. It takes you a minute to pull yourself to your feet, and your head still pounds. You're in a forest. Not one that looks familiar, but it's something. It's reality. \n"
"A roar cuts through your musings, painfully loud. Three creatures burst from the foliage, screeching as they flee past you, lizard-like beasts almost as tall as you are. You watch them flee, turning back just in time to spot a colossal beast crushing the trees in front of you. It roars again, the sound pounding your bones to jelly, as it charges you... \n"
"Existence gives way, and you find yourself falling once more."

This should be done by shuffling together the 8 locations removed from the game during setup (the versions of each [[Adrift]] location in play not currently being used) and drawing 1 at random. If you are instructed to choose a random location that fits a certain criterion, keep drawing locations until one is drawn that satisfies the effect's requirements."

"You come to in a moonlit jail cell. Your head pounds like nothing you've ever felt before, and as you try and get someone's attention you feel the flow of time slip around you, and suddenly the sun is high in the sky. You manage to attract the attention of a very confused police officer, who doesn't remember you ever being brought in. \n"
"He asks you a few questions - which you do your best to answer, though your memories are of little help to you - before releasing you onto the streets of Arkham, nonplussed but without reason to hold you. \n"
"Emerging from the station, you're forced to duck into an alleyway as you spot an officer approaching, supporting a barely-conscious you. \"Picked this one up right off the street,\" you hear him comment to the desk sergeant. \"Bold as brass, just lying there in a drunken stupor.\" He's not got it quite right, but you can hardly stop to correct him."

"Your reverie doesn't last long. The Myriad's ritual was disrupted by your efforts, but could still continue. It's daytime now, so presumably it's the next day... or the previous one. You spot a newsagent with a stack of papers on sale, and your heart sinks as you read the date: \n"
