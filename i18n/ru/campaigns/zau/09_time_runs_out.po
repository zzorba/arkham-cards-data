"\"Even as I write this at my library table, it seems that an ancient midnight plucks at the lamp. The bookcases turn to walls of oozing, nighted stone. There is no longer a table ... nor one who writes... and I breathe the noisome dankness of a dungeon lying unfathomed by any sun, in a lost world.\"\n"

"Even in the midst of your current mission, you're forced to take a moment to gawk. Everything that ever was, everything that ever will be, could be, is here, open to you like the pages of a book. The knowledge, the opportunity, the sheer beauty of it all... it's a lot to take in.\n"
"Still, the moment passes, and the beauty of the scene is marred somewhat by the formless presence rising above it. Aforgomon, god of the minutes and the cycles; an unfathomable being who seeks nothing less than to unmake everything you see here. Mount Hollyoke's disrupted ritual is the fulcrum through which Aforgomon can reach into your universe.\n"
"And between this cosmic force and the universe it seeks to annihilate... you. You suddenly feel very, very small."

For the best experience, do not look at the reverse of these cards unless an effect instructs you to do so.During this scenario, you will sometimes be instructed to choose a random location. This should be done by shuffling together the 8 locations removed from the game during setup (the versions of each location in play not currently being used) and drawing 1 at random. If you are instructed to choose a random location that fits a certain criterion, keep drawing locations until one is drawn that satisfies the effect's requirements."

"The end of time is an experience unlike any other. Everything will be still; any sense of movement or causality was gone. Everything that was or could be or never was will be happening now, inasmuch as 'now' would have any meaning here.\n"
"All times are one. Everything will be now. And here is where you were stuck, where you would have been made part of an unchanging tapestry of reality, where you could be, would be, were, are, will be trapped forever. That is, if forever still existed."

"You find yourself, eventually, lying on a smooth, flat surface. Every inch of your body wants to sink into the floor, become one with the ground. You stay that way for a long, long time.\n"
"It's the smell of smoke that finally makes you pull yourself up. You're in the gymnasium of Mount Hollyoke Elementary School. The cultists and gangsters seem to be long gone, leaving behind only dormant runes and abandoned texts. The smoke drifts in from the rear door, so you exit out the front.\n"
"Day broke at some point, perhaps more than once. But you made it through, reality made it through, and perhaps, now, you can return to some semblance of normality. You've not lived that life for a year, sure, but you're the only you in the present now. You'll need to find somewhere new to live...\n"
"Lost in your thoughts, you watch as a conflagration consumes the school, presumably set by the backfiring ritual. This whole thing started with a fire; it seems only fitting that it should end the same way."

"Everything that ever was, everything that ever will be, could be, is here, open to you like the pages of a book, reset to how it was before this fight begun. As Aforgomon's unholy presence once again looms above you, you let out a long breath, ready for round two."
