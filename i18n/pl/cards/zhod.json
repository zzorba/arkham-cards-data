His curiosity and natural ability to relate to the people he met led him to study social sciences and then to become a professor of anthropology at Miskatonic University. Since arriving in Arkham, Julian has made some disturbing discoveries while comparing his work on African tribes with other societies around the world. Dark rituals and ancient, unhealthy beliefs have uncanny similarities, which is unusual given their geographical and temporal distance. It is as if something beyond our understanding connects these people who have never been in contact with each other. Julian knows that to find the answers to his questions, he will have to return to the field sooner or later.",
