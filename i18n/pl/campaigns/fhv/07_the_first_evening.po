"As you return to Hemlock Vale, a young red-headed girl in a rabbit mask introduces herself as Rebecca, Mother Rachel’s daughter, and leads you by the hand to dinner in the Commons. The long building’s large barn doors are open to let out the rich scent of roasted vegetables and savory meat. The people of the Vale sit and eat in lively conversation, each of them in their white-gold cloaks. At the head of the room, Mother Rachel stands up and calls for attention. Rebecca leads you to the now-picked-over dinner spread as the room falls silent.\n"
"“<i>Meine lieben Freunde.</i> What a blessing that all of us have come here, on the threshold of infinity. And what a greater blessing still that pilgrims have come here, so full of light and curiosity!” Mother Rachel gestures to Dr. Marquez to her right, and to you. “We have waited for the right moment to open our community. Our community which is truly the ‘Sanctuary of Transfiguration’ we long dreamed of. For each of us yearns to be remade as we wait to join our light with the light of the cosmos.”\n"
"The room bursts into applause as Leah Atwood and several locals place trays of honeyed cakes topped with robust red fruit in the center of each table. Your stomach grumbles as you take a bite of shriveled greens. It has a faint bitter taste, and a sharp smell."

msgid "As you seat yourself across from William and Mother Rachel, a thin older woman with bronze skin stares morosely at you. “Mother, please,” William vainly attempts to spoonfeed her chowder as her eyes follow you, lips pursed.

"Mother Rachel beams. “We Atwoods have been here almost as long as the Hemlocks. Our family helped build Hemlock Harbor. We planted half of Pearl Orchard, and we put our lives on the line for Wilbur Hemlock and his doomed whaling enterprise. And when whaling all but died out, we were here to pick up the pieces,” Mother Rachel says smugly. You note William’s grimace as the matron goes on.\n"

I attended seances with Sarah Winchester, studied mesmerism in France, and became a member of the Ghost Club in London. Everywhere I studied, I learned more and more of our connectedness. Our many-faceted oneness. And so I brought my learning home, to my family, where it always belonged.”"

"“The Hemlock family is the very lifeblood of Hemlock Isle,” William boasts. “In our heyday, Hemlock Harbor was a bustling hub for mariners far and wide. My grandfather Wilbur commanded dozens of whaling vessels. But his pride and joy was the Annabelle Lee.” He looks forlornly at his elderly mother. “Naturally, it sank. As did the profits from the whaling industry. My grandfather blamed it all on some kind of curse. He believed in it so strongly that he locked my poor mother in the attic of our family home for weeks at a time.”\n"

"“Those huge shellfish we saw on the beach reminded me of something in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I wonder if Mr. Verne ever visited Hemlock Isle,” Theo says. “Actually, if he did, I’d know about it. Because I would have definitely asked for his autograph.” You decide not to tell the young man when Mr. Verne died, or the likelihood of him visiting Hemlock Isle. When he sees Helen approach, Theo greets her with a full-on bear hug. “I thought you were leaving!”\n"
"Helen replies that she and Lizzie are leaving in the morning, and Theo looks worried. “Not back to Vermont, right?”\n"
"Helen smiles patiently. “Uncle George has a boat, Theo. So, no. Not to Vermont. You know Uncle George’s address in Portland. You can always come see us.” She kisses her brother on the cheek and gives him one last hug. Theo rubs his eyes with the back of his sleeve, then walks back into the Commons.\n"
"Once he is gone, Helen locks eyes with you. “Let me help the survey. Lizzie’ll be safe in Portland. Maybe together, you and I can convince him to leave.”"

"You join Theo at the entrance to the Commons as the sun sets on the idyllic village, dazzlingly bright. “Y’know. Sometimes I like to think the sun is an eye. The eye of the sky. Always watching us. But then I think of where the other eye is,” Theo points to the darkening horizon and the faint moon. “Tricky isn’t it? You never know about that sky.” He narrows his eyes and points up at the moon. “But I’m on to you, moon.” A woman wearing flannel and well-worn hunting gear approaches to break his reverie. “Hey sis, I told you—”\n"
"She interrupts, lip curled in a snarl. “You told me, yes. I know you made up your mind. But Lizzie needs to hear it from you—Just come back to Akwan. Is it really so hard?” As the pair argue, you excuse yourself from the conversation. Several minutes later, Theo finds you back inside. “Sorry you had to see that. Family drama.”"

She says you’re very important. Almost as important as Mama.” You look across the room to Mother Rachel, warmly smiling at the assembly. “Sometimes, when I don’t want anyone to see me, I put my mask on,” Rebecca says as she slides the rabbit mask down to hide her long, red scars. Her thick red hair spills out around the mask as she cocks her head to the side.\n"

They wear a mix of everyday working clothes—notably, no cloaks—and regard you with careful curiosity until you explain that you’re here on a survey. A man with a kind smile and a long scar down his cheek asks, “You’re here to study...the wildlife?” You say yes, and he and his friends burst out laughing. “We work on the docks up in Akwan. We’re just here to ‘study’ the free food.” You laugh along to their stories of gargantuan shellfish and biggest catches. As they disperse, the man with the long scar presses a smooth, perfect river rock into your palm. “Take it,” he says. “It’ll protect you.”"

"The evening chatter fades as residents trickle out of the Commons. There is an uncharacteristic spring in Dr. Marquez’s step as you reconvene outside the Commons. The sunset casts the sky in shades from ochre, to lilac, to violet. The professor cracks a handful of walnuts as you share your impressions of Hemlock Isle.\n"
"“This island has the density and special variance of a jungle, but it’s far more dangerous than any jungle. I have no clue why someone would start a commune in such a hazardous environment, but I understand it wasn’t always so deadly. Something was introduced and fundamentally changed the local ecosystem,” Dr. Marquez muses.\n"
"You mention the unusually good mood shared by everyone in the village, and the professor nods. “Most everyone looks blissed out of their minds. It’s like walking into an opium den. But as far as I can tell, the food isn’t laced with anything. Though I didn’t try the bread pudding. I’ve never liked bread, and the last time I had pudding was in Oxford.”\n"
"The professor’s reference to the prestigious university brings Bertie Musgrave to mind, and you ask where he is.\n"
"“You haven’t seen him? I assumed he went back to the boarding house to rest,” she scowls. “Theo offered to lend us his truck for the evening. I thought we could observe some of the local wildlife at night, but I suppose we should find him first.”\n"
"A heavy breeze stirs the trees and grass around you, smelling of cedar and pine. Dr. Marquez grips her cane. “If you’d rather take the truck and continue the survey, I can look for Bertie on my own.”"
