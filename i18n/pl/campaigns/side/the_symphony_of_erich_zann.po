"<fancy>Sunday, March 12th, 1922. Paris, France.</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>Dearest friend,</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>I heard you've come to Paris and I am quite troubled you did not reach out to meet with me. It has been too long since our last supper. Alas, I am afraid I must ask you to visit the théâtre once more, this time not for our pleasantries. A week ago, I visited a new viol player in our theatre, a German fellow named Erich Zann. He became increasingly absent during the theatre's gatherings. The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness. Zann said that he was old, lonely, and afflicted with strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music. Although he seemed genuine in intent, I could sense a horrible fear behind his eyes, and a chilling cold emanating from his window, as if someone—something were listening to use from outside. That was a few days before his disappearance. It may be selfish and irrational, but I now fear for the safety of the remainder of the orchestra. Come by the Auseil Theatre as soon as you have time, I will brief you on the details after our overdue greetings.</fancy>\n"

When Auguste sends you a letter describing the very same person, you are compelled to investigate."

msgid "You are consumed in savage and impenetrable darkness, with chaos and pandemonium before you and the daemon madness of that night-baying orchestra behind you. About to lose grasp within the paradoxical sounds and unknowable shape at the edge of your mind, you stagger backwards in the darkness to find your footing but flail away at nothing for what seems like eternity. Before you know it, you find yourself out in front of the theatre, the rain drowning your ears and beating you awake."
msgstr ""

msgid "Racing mindlessly out into the narrow, steep, and ancient street of steps and tottering houses; clattering down steps and over cobbles to the lower streets and the putrid canyon-walled river; panting across the great dark bridge to the broader, healthier streets and boulevards we know; all these are terrible impressions that linger with you. And you recall that there was no wind, and that the moon was out, and that all the lights of the city twinkled. Despite your most careful searches and investigations, you have never since been able to find the Auseil Theatre and neither the Rue d'Auseil. No one you've asked has ever seen the Rue d'Auseil or even heard about the orchestra. But you are not wholly sorry; either for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses of the closely written sheets which alone could have explained the music of Erich Zann."
