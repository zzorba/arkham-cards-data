"If the O'Bannions have laid their hands on the expedition cargo, then they are surely aware of its worth.  Any loot of high enough value will be stored somewhere secure but accessible, alongside other valuable items that the thieves intend to fence.  Moreover, the amount and variety of the stolen artifacts would make finding a single buyer nigh impossible.  The most likely conclusion is that the O'Bannions will sell the artifacts piecemeal to collectors who know not to ask questions.  The one situation where these threads come together is a black market auction run by the gangsters.  You make the usual trade of dollars for rumors to learn about where such an auction is being held, and head back to your home to prepare.\n"
"Having spent the early evening on the waterfront, you arrive fashionably late to the event.  A few other finely-dressed latecomers file alongside you toward the O'Bannions' cover business, a private art gallery.  Two hulking mobsters stand at the entrance, sizing you up as you approach.  The thought occurs that they likely won't let you inside with any weapons.  The question now is how to proceed."

"You stumble as you escape the auction house, slipping down to the pavement for a brief moment.  The gangsters crowd around the open doors as they watch you recover, but don't make any further attempt to pursue you.  The group leader takes a step forward and points to you vindictively.  \"Now you listen good, pal.  We've seen you all over the building.  And those other spooks too.  And you been fightin' each other, which means that you're after the same thing that they were – all that stone junk.\"\n"
"You freeze at the mention of the stone, but the man only narrows his eyes.  \"Hardly anybody knows about that stone, which means that Wycliffe must have sent you.  You crawl back to that stuffed shirt and tell him that he ain't welchin' on our deal.  He'll pay double what we agreed if he wants to see any o' that cargo.  Nobody crosses the O'Bannions.  Understand?\"  The gangsters turn back toward the auction house, leaving you to your affairs.\n"
"You compose yourself as you process the gangster's words.  Wycliffe hired the O'Bannions to steal the expedition cargo?  Then why did he hire you to find it?  And if he knew that the O'Bannions had it, why didn't he say so?  These questions only lead to other questions, all answers eluding you as you pat down your soggy outer clothes."

"You try to explain to the broker the nature of your investigation with as few details as possible, but she scrutinizes each word until your purpose at the auction is clear.  You begrudgingly tell Ms. Shanley about your brief investigation of the riverfront before arriving at the auction, which causes a puzzling shift in her expression.  She sits in quiet thought for a moment, before casting her steely gaze back up at you.  \"No, your story isn't credible.  Wycliffe wouldn't have sent you to the river in the first place.\"\n"
"You press Ms. Shanley on how she knows what Wycliffe would do, and show her the documents from Wycliffe as proof of your story.  Her confusion deepens as she appraises the papers, and she leans back into her chair for another drag on her cigarette.  The woman scrutinizes your face once more as she exhales before replying.  \"What I'm about to tell you does not leave this room.  Am I understood?\"  You nod curtly, though Ms. Shanley takes her time before responding again.  \"Wycliffe is the man who hired us to take the artifacts in the first place.  Here.\"  The broker opens her desk and pulls out a check for a sizeable sum, with Wycliffe's signature clearly printed at the bottom, a perfect match for the one on your letter.  Ms. Shanley allows you to view the check for a few seconds before she returns it to her desk and stands stiffly.  \"If you want any further information, I suggest you ask Wycliffe directly.  I have enough to worry about without this backward deal adding to it.  And I suggest you leave before you give security any extra reasons to ice you.\""

msgid "As you depart the auction, a second thought keeps worming its way to the front: the shadowy group that you faced at the auction is not with the O'Bannions after all.  This group is well-prepared and subtle, and without your interference in their plans, they most likely seized every last artifact the gangsters had stockpiled.  You only hope that this does not contribute much to whatever plan they pursue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Your visit to the auction may have been in part frustrating, but you managed to lay claim to some hard evidence at last.  You are still learning how best to handle the statuette, as its construction is utterly alien.  You're unsure if any human hand could have carved such a thing, or if it even originates on Earth at all.  The one thing you are sure of is that the world seems to bend slightly around the stone, and something like that is better kept in your hands than the enemy's."
msgstr ""

msgid "Recent events may have brought you closer to the truth, but your enemies still managed to repossess the vast majority of the Mycenaean stone before you even arrived.  They vanished as quickly as they appeared, which would have left you with a cold trail were it not for the revelation about Wycliffe.  The time has come to dispel the air of conspiracy that has saturated your investigation from the very start.  You set off for Wycliffe's estate without delay."
