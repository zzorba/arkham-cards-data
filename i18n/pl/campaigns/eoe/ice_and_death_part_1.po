"After two weeks and many hours of hard work, the expedition is ready to make its first foray into the cold, dead continent of Antarctica. Ms. Takada, along with two other mechanics, have fully assembled three aeroplanes along the flat ice shelf—a perfect place for takeoffs and landings. Your team congregates by the aeroplanes, along with several days' worth of camping equipment. The plan is to fly two of the planes over the vast jagged peaks, taking aerial photographs of the stone city mentioned in Dyer's account… that is, if such a thing really exists.\n"
"\"If we can find a safe landing zone, we will set up a temporary outpost,\" Dr. Kensler explains. \"Dyer, Danforth, Fredericks, and Claypool will stick around while the rest of us head back to base camp. We can use the sledges to ferry supplies to and from the camps. Otherwise, we'll simply scout out the area and head back to base camp.\" The team nods in agreement and begins boarding the planes."

"\"Buckle up,\" you tell the others as you spin the propeller and hop into the pilot's seat. You motion to the pilot of the other plane, and both of you start your engines. One at a time, you take off from the ice shelf and soar into the opaque fog. You have never flown a plane of this size, but but it's no match for your piloting skills. Within moments you have a handle on the beast's clunky controls. The weather is another matter entirely. The rough Antarctic winds and harsh fog make for poor flying conditions. The deeper you head through the beautiful and deceptive polar mirages, the more you struggle to keep a handle on the aeroplane.\n"
"Dr. Kensler peers out a window as you pass a magnificent view of distant mountains like vibrant, enchanted castles floating above the clouds. \"They're beautiful,\" she remarks quietly.\n"
"\"These are nothing,\" Dyer begins, \"Wait until you see-\" And then the storm hits. The winter winds are so sudden and fierce that they almost force you out of your seat. Both planes shunt to and fro in the horrid winds, and you hear several of the passengers shouting behind you.\n"
"\"What in the hell?\" Fredericks grunts.\n"
"\"We have to head back!\" Claypool shouts. \"These winds will force us down if we keep going!\"\n"
"\"We're so close!\" Dr. Kensler growls bitterly.\n"
"\"We don't have a choice!\" he yells back, but it's too late. The plane lurches toward the ground, and you struggle in vain to regain control. All of the passengers notice the dark shape in the sky at the same time you do. It is a massive shadow, like a curtain drawn across the mountains, or perhaps the tattered wings of an antediluvian behemoth. It scowls at you with dreadful, hollow eyes. Then it reaches out, and—"

"As you regain consciousness, intense pain sears through your blistering skin. Through the haze, you can barely hear muffled shouting outside the burning husk of the aeroplane. Somebody grips your arm, pulls you from the wreckage, and hurls you onto the soft snow. More shouts erupt all around you. \"There's another!\" \"Quickly!\" \"Grab my hand!\"\n"
"You rise to your feet with a world of effort. Miraculously, you are only bruised and winded. Most of the other team members are similarly unharmed, except…"

"Danforth drops to his knees as he examines the elderly man's mangled body. \"I… I should have…\" he begins, but the words aren't there.\n"
"Dr. Kensler places a hand on his shoulder. \"This is my fault, not yours,\" she offers. \"I shouldn't have dismissed his concerns. That shape in the sky… it wasn't natural.\" But the horrible look in Danforth's eyes doesn't fade.\n"
"\"C'mon, kid,\" Fredericks motions to Danforth. \"I know it hurts. But we gotta get moving. Gonna be night sooner than yeh think. Then we're all hosed.\"\n"

"\"Dammit,\" Cookie grunts as they pull Ellsworth's lifeless body out of the wreckage. \"Dammit all to hell. Damn this damned expedition and all you damned people!\" Dr. Kensler and Professor Dyer take the brunt of his rage, but they aren't looking at Cookie—their eyes are fixed on Ellsworth 's corpse. You spot Claypool turning away, unable to even look upon his friend 's cold, dead eyes. \"What in the hell was that damned thing in the sky? Do you even know? Of Course yeh don't know. Dammit!\" Cookie continues swearing for some time before marching off to the snow by himself.\n"
"\"Mr. Fredericks, where are you going?\" Dr. Kensler shouts over the raging wind.\n"
"\"Where do you think?\" He yells back. \"We gotta find camp for the night or we'll all end up like Ellsworth, won't we?\"\n"

"Anyu lays by Eliyah's side, nudging him over and over in a vain attempt to get him to stop playing dead. The dog's whines are the only sound that any of you dare to make for some time.\n"
"Finally, Takada sits down beside Anyu and begins to run her gloved fingers through the dog's fur soothingly. \"Come on, girl. We gotta get moving.\"\n"
"\"Oh, just leave the damned dog,\" Cookie says. The glares of the rest of the team quickly shut him up.\n"
"It's several more minutes before Takada is able to coax Anyu from Eliyah's body. Even as you trudge along the snow, the dog glances over her shoulder and whines, hoping that any second he'll stop playing pretend and run to catch up with you. Only once the body has faded into the opaque fog does the realization of his death set in for all of you."

"\"No… No…!\" Professor Dyer tugs at Danforth's lifeless arm with a single shaking hand. \"Why did I allow him to come? Why was I so foolish? Why?\" he berates himself.\n"
"Dr. Kensler places a hand on his shoulder. \"I am the one who let him come, not you. The blame rests with me,\" she offers.\n"
"Professor Dyer lowers his head in resignation. \"Perhaps… perhaps now he will be able to truly rest. His troubles and his daemonic visions are finally at an end.\" He reaches out to touch the student's cold forehead, but is pulled away by Claypool and Fredericks.\n"
"\"Come on,\" Claypool says. \"We don't have long before nightfall. We have to get a move on.\"Dyer nods grimly, but you see dark thoughts swirling behind the veil of his wide, horrified eyes."

"The two stay silent for some time before Dr. Kensler interrupts their mourning. \"I'm sorry, but we have to get moving.\"\n"
"\"Let them grieve, would you?\" Eliyah interjects, but despite the situation, both of the explorers stand and snap to attention.\n"

"Ellsworth places a hand on Cookie's shoulder, but the gruff man only shakes it off. He points an accusatory finger at Takada. \"This is all your fault!\" he shouts, trudging forward and pushing her onto the ground. \"If you hadn't built this damned plane like a deathtrap, Claypool would still be alive!\"\n"
"Takada glares up at him. \"There was nothing wrong with the plane! You saw that thing in the sky, didn't you?\"\n"

"Danforth responds with a quiet mutter, only barely audible over the howling wind. \"The wings. The eyes in darkness. A windowless solid with five dimensions…\" He looks up when he realizes the rest of the team is staring blankly at him.\n"
"\"We have no time to mourn,\" Dr. Kensler declares. \"It will be nightfall soon enough.\"\n"
"Eliyah shakes his head in protest. \"Come on, Kensler. Takada is dead. Give us a half-second, would you?\"\n"
