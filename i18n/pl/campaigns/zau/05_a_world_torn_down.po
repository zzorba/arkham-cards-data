msgid "Several effects refer to standard actions. A standard action is any action that does not have a limitation on its use, regardless of its source. <i>For example, Finn Edwards has a copy of Leo De Luca in play. He has four standard actions on his turns - the default three and an additional action from Leo - as well as an additional, non-standard action from his investigator ability that can only be used to evade.</i>"

msgid "Each investigator is considered to gain their actions for the next round in step 4.2 of the upkeep phase. Effects that grant you additional actions on each of your turns are also considered to grant you actions at this point. This means that effects after aninvestigator's turn cannot make them lose actions for the nextround, unless they happen after the the upkeep phase. <i>For example, Finn Edwards is attacked by a Chronophage in the enemy phase. This would cause him to lose an action, but as his turn has ended he has no actions remaining. During the upkeep phase of the same round, he draws the weakness Overzealous; if an encounter card drawn from this effect would cause him to lose actions, this happens as normal.</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a player card effect (such as the Gold Pocket Watch) causes the investigator phase to repeat, investigators are considered to gain their actions for their turns at the start of the phase. If a player card effect allows an investigator to take an additional turn, they are considered to gain their actions at the start of that turn."
