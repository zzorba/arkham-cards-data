"<i>The Feast of Hemlock Vale</i> campaign features a new gameplay concept: The Codex. During this campaign, some card effects may direct players to read a specific codex entry. While playing, keep the Campaign Guide on hand for easy reference.\n"
"Certain locations, characters, or enemies in <i>The Feast of Hemlock Vale</i> have codex entries, marked with ([codex] X). To read a character or location’s codex entry, you must pay all costs on that ability first, then turn to the current scenario or prelude’s Codex in this Campaign Guide and resolve all text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each codex entry cannot be resolved more than once per scenario or prelude unless otherwise stated."

msgid "When resolving a codex entry, the player who triggered that entry resolves all effects <i>(resolving a test, dealing damage, paying resources, etc.)</i>. If it is unclear who triggered the codex entry, the lead investigator resolves the entry."

"<i>The Feast of Hemlock Vale</i> campaign gives players just three days in-game to play out its story. This campaign also contains playable preludes in which investigators may interact with the residents of Hemlock Vale, learn the secrets of Hemlock Isle, and make preparations for the next scenario.\n"
"Preludes are non-confrontational segments that are set up with locations and a scenario reference, act, and agenda. The end of each prelude provides several choices on which scenario to play next. Depending on the day and time, some scenarios may provide new story options or challenges. Players will not have time to play every scenario or befriend each resident on a single playthrough of this campaign."
