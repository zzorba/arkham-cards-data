msgid "Prelude: The Second Evening"
msgstr ""

msgid "The rain continues through the day. When you arrive at the Commons for dinner, the tables have been pushed to the sides of the room and warm lamps are hung from colorful ribbons. Dozens of new faces peer out from the crowd of cloaked locals: visitors from the mainland. A large sculpture looms in the center of the room, festooned with violet and white blossoms that seem to palpitate in the soft light. The room goes silent as Mother Rachel addresses the assembly. “Friends. Brethren. Each of you is a miracle of time and light. You are the promise of your true self—” The matron stops mid-sentence."

msgid "A shadow passes over the matron’s face as she sways, looking for a moment as though she might faint. The air in the room swirls thickly. Oily patterns dance in the light as you feel a now-familiar light-headedness. Someone steps forward to help Mother Rachel, but she holds up one hand and steadies herself."
msgstr ""

msgid "A sturdy figure cuts through the crowd. “Has anyone seen Simeon?” Leah Atwood asks in a trembling voice. She looks at the assembly with wide, searching eyes. “Please. Simeon. Now’s not the time for pranks,” she addresses her son, but to no response. The air in the room swirls thickly. “Enough,” Mother Rachel shoos her sister away. Oily patterns dance in the light as you feel a now-familiar light-headedness."

msgid "Mother Rachel regains her composure. “Tonight is the shortest night of the year. And tomorrow is the beginning of eternity. So on this night, let us dance.” The assembly bursts into rapturous applause. A ragtag band in the corner starts playing as the dance begins. Several friendly faces beckon you to join."

msgid "The Vale’s matriarch stands apart from the throng, arms crossed. Tears glisten on her cheeks as she watches the room. You approach and ask her to dance. “I’m sorry. I can’t,” she replies. The strain in her voice is evident, and you ask what the matter is. “We are called to give up many things in this life. I only pray that what we gain is worth the cost.”"

msgid "Midway into the evening, the dance reaches a lull. While rain patters outside, the dancing revelers move like smoke in the dim commons. Dr. Marquez signals you to join her at the side of the room. “There’s something very wrong here,” she says in a low voice. “There are maybe a dozen members of the Vale who have disappeared—some even in the last few days. Mother Rachel seems blissfully unconcerned. And then there are these ‘wonders’ everyone talks about. I’m starting to suspect the ‘wondrous’ feeling here isn’t just hypoxia.” You mention your own dizziness and strange euphoria over the past few days."

msgid "The professor hands you Susan Pearl’s diary. “Thank you for recovering this, by the way. It’s a fascinating read. In the last year of her life, Madame Pearl was wracked by hallucinations and a chronic wasting disease. Whatever it is, it incites rapid mutation before breaking down muscles, organs, and cognitive function. Reading between the lines, I get the impression the entire Pearl family was similarly affected prior to the incident that devastated the ridge.”"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You share your own observations of Hemlock Isle. More than just ‘wonders,’ the creatures here are either sickly and malnourished, or aggressively vivacious. Dr. Marquez nods along. “Everything is affected. Sickly. Starving. Mutating. And it’s all highly localized. There are no reports of these strange phenomena elsewhere. It’s only here.” She produces a creased map of the island and points to the north hills. “Pearl Ridge hasn’t recovered in the past twenty years since it was obliterated.”\n"
"Marquez holds up two rings of glassy wood from both Eastwick Bog and Pearl Orchard, then draws a ring around Pearl Ridge on her map. “The bitter eggs this morning reminded me of a report after the Tunguska event. A meteorite obliterated miles of Russian countryside, but the effects on the locals were even more devastating. Stores of food were poisoned. Livestock perished. Nearby villages were slowly deserted as families who lived there for generations died of starvation or worse.” She draws a larger concentric circle around the first.\n"
"“Nobody has said anything about a meteor, but judging by the massive sinkhole in front of the Pearl Estate, something emerged from the rock. My working theory is that the mining operation opened a vein and released whatever poisoned gas or mineral affecting the island.”\n"
"Dr. Marquez’s expression goes grave. “There’s something else. Something we shouldn’t discuss here. Follow me.” As you follow the professor out of the Commons, a stout figure bumps into you."

msgid "“Terribly sorry,” Bertie says. “Professor! And you! I assumed you had retired early.” His eyes go wide. “Are we conspiring? Surveying? I would love to—” Dr. Marquez cuts him off with a sharp glance. “After last night, Bertie, I think it’s best if you stay in your room tonight and rest.” The young assistant looks quite wounded, but doesn’t object. “Very well then,” he mutters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"“Terrible—sorry,” Bertie slurs. A dopey smile spreads across his face. “They told me not to worry about you. The people told me. The people. The people in the—” he gestures to the crowd around. “The place. I had an epiphany but I quite forgot it. Mother Rachel has been taking care of me. They told me there will be more dancing later, in the crossroads, and a large bonfire.”\n"
"“You need to rest. Head back to the boarding house,” Marquez insists. You can’t be sure if Bertie even heard her as he slips away."

"“We didn’t need to involve him. He’s much better in a lab than in the field anyway.” Dr. Marquez leads you outside. “Something followed me down from the ridge today. Something big and hungry. I tried to take shelter at the old Atwood Farm, but it was boarded up. Windows and doors. It smelled something awful. I’m not even sure what I heard coming from inside,” she says soberly. When you ask her to explain, she shakes her head.\n"
"“This place definitely isn’t what it seems. I don’t know what the Vale folks are hiding in that old farmhouse, but I plan to find out.”"
