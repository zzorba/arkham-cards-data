"It's a rare enough event to find any sort of hospitality in the vast expanse of Wonderland, so the sudden appearance of an English country manor gives you definite pause.  You advance quickly to the manor and shout a greeting to the two figures seated outside the main door.  Both are dressed in the fine uniforms of aristocratic servants, albeit one is a frog and one is a fish.  They glance at you lazily but do not rise from their seats, only sighing wistfully.\n"
"An awful commotion sounds dully through the door, although the two footmen seem not to hear it.  \"If you've more messages, you'll simply have to wait,\" the frog footman croaks at you, \"we've been waiting for weeks and we still can't get in.\"  You ask if the door is locked.  \"No,\" the fish footman burbles, \"but it's a footman's job to let people in, and if we're not inside, well...\"  The two footmen sigh a second time and go back to staring up at the sky dumbly.  You give the footmen a nominal thanks and open the door for yourself.\n"
"The inside of the manor is utterly chaotic.  Toppled furniture and display pieces litter the floors, and the wallpaper has been shredded systematically.  Each step brings you closer to the source of the noise, which you can only guess is a monster of some kind by the shrieking, clanging and scrambling you hear emitting from the kitchen.  Determined not to be caught by another of Wonderland's surprises, you ready yourself for a fight before you enter.\n"
"You burst through the kitchen door just in time to dodge a thrown piece of crockery.  A woman in the regal attire of a duchess stands beside her cook, both of them staring down an enormous shadowy boar, but both also looking more annoyed than frightened.  The Duchess scolds the monster severely and hurls pots and pans while her Cook does the bulk of the fighting with any utensils at hand.\n"
"\"You'll catch a beating yet!\" the Duchess shrieks as she grabs for more dishes.  The Cook hurls a butcher's cleaver at the boar, who swats it out of the air with a feral cry.  \"Pepper!  The air must be thick with pepper!\" the brutish noblewoman clangs two ladles together as she calls again and again for pepper.  The Cook staves off the monster with a carving knife as she joins in the calls for pepper.  As you prepare to take action, you spy a lone pepper grinder sitting atop the counter next to you."

"You grab the pepper grinder, half-questioning your own actions and half-assuring yourself that Wonderland has its own bizarre logic, even if you can't make heads or tails of it.  The handle whirls around easily, grinding the peppercorns and sending out a cloud of spice far denser than you expected.  Seconds later, the entire kitchen is blanketed with pepper.  You hold your nose, but the sneezes escape you all the same.  The shadowy boar joins you in wild sneezing while the Duchess and Cook, who are completely unaffected, cheer, still hurling dishes at the beast.  You can't make out a thing, but you can tell that the sneezes of the beast are growing more and more frenzied, until a single mighty expulsion clears the room of pepper, along with a fading shadow creature.\n"
"In the spot where the monster once stood, a baby with pig-like features lies in a bundle of cloth.  It wails loudly, still sneezing as the Duchess prances over to pick him back up.  \"There!  That will teach you to throw a tantrum just to annoy us!\"  You lower your weapons and scratch the back of your head in confusion, but the Duchess is completely delighted and the Cook has returned to preparing some unappealing soup.  \"Come now, sing with us, dear!  Speak roughly to your little boy, and beat him when he sneezes...\""

"Your own means have carried you through the trials of Alice's dreams so far, and you see no reason to doubt your own abilities now.  You advance on the beast and combat it on your terms.  The screams from the Duchess and the Cook reach a deafening pitch, but you continue the fight in spite of them.  For minutes you probe and strike, wearing down the monster's energy gradually.  At last, the shadowy pig shrieks in panic and leaps out the kitchen window to escape your assault.\n"
"You turn back to the Duchess and her Cook, expecting a tiny bit of gratitude only to see them both frothing with fury and eyes wide with malice.  \"Brute!  Callous wretch!\" the Duchess bellows, gritting her teeth, \"you've savaged my boyish pig!  My piggish boy!\"  You can barely form a response as the two pelt you with any dishes and utensils they can reach.  From what little the Duchess and her Cook say coherently, you realize that the boar monster was once the Duchess' son, and was somehow transformed into the frightening creature you just drove away.  No explanation you give placates the crazed duo in the slightest.  You beat a hasty retreat to the relative safety of the manor's hallway as you dodge the debris.  The shouts and wails of the two madwomen echo after you, though neither makes any attempt to follow you out."

"You exit the Duchess' manor to find the two footmen exactly where you left them.  They look to you with the same dull expressions as before.  \"Got what you came for?\" the frog footman asks drearily.  You're not really sure how to respond, but the fish footman doesn't give you a window to speak.  \"I doubt it,\" he bubbles, \"or else this message wouldn't have arrived.\"  He gestures to an enormous letter leaning up against the courtyard stones with your name written across the envelope.  You wonder for a moment who could possibly know that you would be at the Duchess' manor for such a brief span of time, and the answer soon occurs to you: Alice herself!\n"
"You had hoped that getting help in the form of a letter would have been more direct and clear than the other forms of assistance Alice had given you.  Unfortunately, you find the letter to be a jumbled mess of unrelated words.  Is Alice's ability to contact you really this limited?  You study the paper for several minutes wondering just what the message is trying to convey.  Some of the words you recognize based on your recent experiences, while others hint at challenges and dangers you have yet to brave.  You carefully discount the out of place words until the remaining ones begin to make sense as directions.  You double and triple check the letter, doubting your ability to make sense of this weirdness, but ultimately set off again through Wonderland if for no other reason than to leave the chaotic manor behind you."
