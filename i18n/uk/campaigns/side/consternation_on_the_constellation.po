"You stare one more time at the cryptic note that sits on your table alongside a brand new set of first-class tickets offering passage aboard the SS Constellation, a luxury ocean liner sailing from Boston to London in a few days' time. The unmarked envelope had arrived just yesterday, promising a welcome solution to a vexing affair.\n"
"In the past few weeks, several collections of esoteric artifacts in Arkham have been ransacked, culminating in the murder of an employee of the Miskatonic Historical Society. Your contacts have informed you that similar burglaries have taken place in Boston, Innsmouth, and New York. Strangely, nothing has been reported missing as yet except for a few records and books. What could these people be looking for? You have a growing fear that it is something dastardly indeed.\n"
"With leads running dry, hopping aboard an ocean liner in response to a note from an unknown sender seems only one step above a wild goose chase, but it's the best chance you may get. With that in mind, you grab the tickets and head out the door."

Since I've learned of the existence of such things, I've dedicated my retirement to trying to keep dangerous relics out of the hands of people like these cultists, but they will go to seemingly any lengths to grasp at horrible power. I thought I could safely transport these relics in secret across the sea, but I was terribly wrong. Thank you for your help. I'll be in touch.\""

msgid "You come to consciousness draped over a piece of wreckage floating on the endless ocean. There is no sign of the Constellation except the flotsam that surrounds you. You think you feel something massive swimming just below and panic hits as you don't dare to think what it might be. It is then that you see the light of an approaching vessel in the night. Perhaps rescue is at hand, though what has been unleashed that night you cannot say."
msgstr ""

msgid "You work the oars of the lifeboat furiously, pushing yourself beyond endurance in the vain hope that you might escape the clutches of the horrific creatures that have overtaken the Constellation. Whether by fortune, providence, or some mysterious power, no foul monster finds its way aboard to end your flight. The tablet in your possession glows with mysterious colors, reflecting the lights of the northern sky overhead. Astonishingly, you watch as the Deep Ones crawl back into the ocean as the Constellation recedes behind you, the ritual seemingly aborted. A horn sounds ahead through the fog, breaking your reverie. Rescue has come!"

msgid "The tablet lies shattered on the ground, its power broken. Looking over the edge of the ship, you can see no sign of the creatures that so tormented the hull mere moments before. Those crew members and passengers that have survived the ordeal gather on deck and stare in disbelief at each other. Finally, the stern voice of an officer calls everyone to action. With a concerted effort, the ship is saved from a watery grave along with the lives of those aboard. You shudder to think of how many more might have been lost in far-off places if the ritual had not been brought to a violent end as well."

Those crew members and passengers that have survived the ordeal gather on deck and stare in disbelief at each other. Then, all are forced to grab hold of whatever is near as the ship lists suddenly to one side. Some scramble to the lifeboats while others dive into the ocean below, heedless of height. Breathless minutes later, you find yourself aboard a rescue vessel, watching the Constellation sink beneath the waters. Lives were lost this night, but you comfort yourself thinking of how many more might have been lost if the ritual had not been brought to a violent end."
