"Warring Example:\n"
"<i>A Disciple of the Swarm is in Streets of New York, a Hune-Stitched Herald is in Arkham, and a Zealot of Paradise is in Streets of Montréal. Each of them has the warring keyword, and each is ready and unengaged.</i>\n"
"<i>During the \"hunter enemies move\" step of the enemy phase, each of these enemies moves once toward the nearest warring enemy of a different faction. In this case, the green enemy moves first, to Arkham. The Hune-Stitched Herald does not move, since there is already an enemy at its location. Finally, the Disciple of the Swarm moves to Arkham, as well.</i>\n"
"<i>During the \"resolve enemy attacks\" step of the enemy phase, each of these enemies attacks a warring enemy of a different faction. First the Zealot of Paradise attacks the Disciple of the Swarm for 1 damage, since it has fewer remaining health than the Hune-Stitched Herald. Next, the Hune-Stitched Herald also attacks the Disciple of the Swarm, dealing 3 damage. This defeats the Disciple of the Swarm before it gets a chance to attack and causes 1 doom to be placed on the blue agenda.</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wards allow investigators to reduce the amount of doom placed on agendas. When doom would be placed on an agenda, for each ward on that agenda, prevent the amount of doom from being placed. Then remove wards from that agenda equal to the amount of doom prevented."

msgid "If investigators are instructed to place 1 or more clues \"around\" a location, those clues should be placed such that they are physically bordering the location card, but not placed onto the location card itself. Clues that are \"around\" a location are not considered to be \"on\" the location and cannot be discovered by any means."

msgid "An enemy with the swarming X keyword is actually a pack of enemies operating in unison. After you put an enemy with the swarming X keyword into play, place the top X cards of your deck facedown underneath the enemy as swarm cards, without looking at them. The enemy they are underneath is called the “host enemy.” Some scenario card effects may also instruct a player to add swarm cards to an enemy. This is done using the same process."
msgstr ""

msgid "If it is ever unclear which investigator should add swarm cards, the lead investigator does so."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each swarm card underneath the host enemy acts as a separate instance of that enemy for most purposes. Each swarm card has the same values and text as its host card. <i>(For example, if an investigator is engaged with a host enemy with 2 swarm cards underneath it, that investigator is engaged with 3 enemies in total.)</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each swarm card attacks separately when enemies attack during the enemy phase. Once the host enemy and all of its swarm cards have attacked during this step, exhaust all of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each swarm card can be attacked or dealt damage separately, but the host enemy cannot be defeated while it still has swarm cards underneath it. When a swarm card is defeated, any excess damage may be dealt to another swarm card underneath the same host enemy or to the host enemy itself. <i>(For example, Tony Morgan uses a .41 Derringer to attack a Stealthy Zoog with 2 swarm cards. The attack deals 2 damage. The first point of damage defeats 1 of the 2 swarm cards, so the excess point of damage may be dealt to another swarm card, defeating it as well.)</i>"

msgid "Anytime a swarm card leaves play, place it on the bottom of its owner’s deck. If you are unsure of the owner of the swarm card, you may look at it to determine its owner."

msgid "The host enemy and all of its swarm cards move, engage, and exhaust as a single entity. (For example, if a host enemy or any of its swarm cards are evaded, all of them exhaust and become disengaged.)"

"Over a decade after the Great War, another kind of war has come to Earth—a conflict wrought by factions long hidden in the shadows of society.\n"
"It began with the murders in Arkham—over a dozen bodies in half as many days. The police thought the perpetrator to be a serial killer at first, until the sixth victim's corpse turned up as a mangled heap of meat and viscera, like a meal chewed up and spit back out. No human could have performed such a grisly murder.\n"
"When similar killings started to sprout up in other cities across North America, you sought to uncover the truth. A serial killer could not be in Arkham, Providence, Montréal, and New York City all at once. This had to be the work of an organization. But that wasn't all you discovered: there were commonalities between many of the victims, sorting them into three distinct groups.\n"
"In Providence, many victims were older and well-educated. In Montréal, those killed lived in the woods outside the city, or had professions dealings with nature or biology in some capacity. In New York, bodies turned up deep in the sewers and underground subway tunnels, their identities shrouded in mystery.\n"
"You have spent the past few weeks trying to unearth the truth behind these murders and the various factions carrying them out. In this time, the conflict has grown exponentially. Massacres. Bombings. Sightings of strange ceremonies in the streets. Entities blotting out the stars in the night sky. Swarms of locust-like insects devouring people whole. Mutated lizard creatures prowling the sewers. And worse yet, while Arkham seems to be conflict's epicenter, these incidents are spreading all across the world.\n"
"This is no ordinary war, and not one the authorities can deal with. You are the only one who suspects the truth. Somehow, you have to find out what these factions are fighting over, and put a stop to the conflict before it consumes the entire world in its madness."

"The swarm of Ezel is too countless to defeat through normal means. But there is a trick! Otherworldly though they may be, the insects are insects nonetheless, and many hives have among them a queen. Using all of your ingenuity, you devise a plan to crush the queen and thereby scatter the swarm.\n"
"To your surprise, your plan works. With the queen dispatched, the swarm is aimless, its hunger replaced by a sense of desperation and panic. It is not long before the myriad creatures descend once more into the pit whence they came. Perhaps another queen will come to unite them, but you will seal that accursed pit long before that happens. For now, Earth is safe."

"The shape of Silenus is formless, perhaps even devoid of matter altogether, but not without weakness. Using the rituals of its own cult against it, you devise a spell of such incandescent heat that not even the emptiness of space can devour it. When your rite is unleashed, the mists retreat in anguish, letting out no sound but the shrill hiss of air being sucked through a vacuum.\n"
"You observe the sky in fear, hoping that the mist does not return the moment your ritual has ended. Minutes pass. Then hours. Familiar stars once more fill the night sky. Perhaps the entity is gone for good. If the notes of the creature's many observers are true, it will likely return in the future—maybe hundreds or thousands of years from now. You may have saved the Earth this day, but the understanding of the entity's true nature haunts you still."
