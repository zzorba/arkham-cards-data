"You stir under a sheet. You bolt upright, half expecting the telltale bodies of the morgue. Instead, you are lying on a sofa, watched by a square-jawed adolescent. \"West? They're up!\"\n"
"From an adjacent room, Herbert West enters scribbling on a notepad. \"Thank you, Dan. Good to see you up and about. We found you just outside the facility. Very <i>lucky</i> of you to make it out. Apologies for my absence. I became sidetracked - I believe I have found a way to destroy that creature that seems to be pursuing you.\"\n"
"You give West the bad news. His emotions are hard to read, but you could swear he's almost amused. \"Well. The monster will have to wait. We've a city to save.\""

msgid "You feel the rain hitting softly against your legs, as the wet mud starts to seep into your clothes. Pulling yourself up from the mire, you look about the alleyway. You're back in Arkham. Somewhere in Easttown."

"It's a dreary afternoon. The sky is a blanket of grey and every footstep you take sticks in the squelching ground below you. The exhaustion weighing on your mind and body tempts you to give in to the pull - but you don't have that luxury.\n"
"You mull over what you've learned. The Plaguebearer- Baalshandor - infected or created the First, that horrid monster that has chased you throughout the city. All the terrors that have plagued Arkham over the past twenty-four hours are the spawn of this herald. Each twisted killer stalking the streets is a sliver of the Plaguebearer's consciousness, controlled through the microscopic organisms found in the miasma.\n"
"And now the twin forces of the Flame and the King, prepare to descend upon Arkham and destroy every trace of life in hopes of preventing what has already occurred. It strikes you that it would almost be worth it. Arkham would be a small price to pay if all of Earth is threatened. But if the doctor spoke true, then their drastic gesture would barely delay the disease-god's plan.\n"
"Which means it's up to you. If you want to stop Baalshandor, you'll have to live till midnight. And if you want that, you'll have to stop the assault. To thwart whatever destruction the Old Ones plan for Arkham.\n"
"You climb the crest of a hill, and turn to look out over Arkham. It's a dark, dangerous place. A city full of desperate last stands and terrible sacrifices. But there is warmth here, and camaraderie, and even love. So many people live here, and you have come to care for Arkham, despite its faults. And now, for this city - for these people - you are the only hope.\n"
"You steel yourself.\n"
"The sky opens up."
