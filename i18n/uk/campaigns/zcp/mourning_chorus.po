"You make your way across town as quickly as you can. The first rays of morning alight a town huddling in quiet fear. It is eerily silent. No early risers leaving their homes. Not even bird songs disturb the stillness. You focus inward, and relax for a moment.\n"
"Then the first horrible note breaks the air.\n"
"Somewhere, nearby, a voice sings out a dark and compelling melody. A song of hate and sorrow, resounding through the empty streets. A melody quickly joined by a second voice, then a third. In short order, the song is repeated all across the town of Arkham.\n"
"But no matter how you adjust, you can always hear that first voice, above the din. Leading the chorus in its eldritch invocations.\n"
"You feel a sting at the base of your skull, and your head goes momentarily fuzzy.\n"
