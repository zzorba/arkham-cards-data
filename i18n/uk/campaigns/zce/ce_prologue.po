"As your ship nears its destination of Reykjavik, you take a moment to review the astonishing details of the case in your journal. Cult activity has increased in Iceland over the past six months with the rise of the \"Disciples of Egil,\" a group that worships one Egil Skallagrímsson, the violent warrior poet and anti-hero of the Icelandic sagas. This strikes you as odd, that a thousand year-old literary character would be the focal point of a cult, and a poet, no less. The more you read of his exploits, the less you seem to understand who he really was. While he solved most of his problems with his blade, he also escaped trouble through his epic poetry. Despite being an abnormally ugly and monstrous figure with both troll and giant lineage, his extreme emotional outbursts bely a depth of character uncommon in 10th century sagas. Most of the country had accepted Egil as a transitional symbol of the country moving on from their heathen past before conversion to Christianity at the end of the 10th century.\n"
"In any case, his followers have been spreading chaos in Reykjavik in traditional Viking fashion, leaving impaled horse heads on \"scorn poles\" as a warning to the city that Egil will return. Indeed, two weeks ago, one of the cultists loosed an \"arrow of war\" into the Parliament House declaring Egil the \"eternal lawspeaker of Iceland and the world at large.\" This winter, the country is preparing for the upcoming 1000th anniversary of the national parliament, the Althing, celebrating a millennium of independence. While local authorities may be content to chalk up this cultist activity to post-war, nationalist fervor, your contact at Miskatonic University, Dr. Agatha Crane, thinks the provenance could be paranormal. She has entrusted you to lead an expedition into the tundra of Iceland to get to the bottom of this mystery with the aid of her friend and former colleague, Professor Shirley Day Morris.\n"
"You see the idyllic coastline of Reykjavik rise into view along the horizon, and prepare to disembark."
