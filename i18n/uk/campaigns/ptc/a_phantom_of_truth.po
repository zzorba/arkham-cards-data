"Several months have passed since The King in Yellow came to the Ward Theatre. You and your companions have been investigating the strange incidents that followed in its wake. What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail… And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\n"
"You’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."
msgstr ""

msgid "It has been several weeks since the events in the asylum, and you are still no closer to the truth about The King in Yellow and Carcosa. You have scoured the city for signs of the others Daniel had mentioned—the ones who are “opening the path to Carcosa”—but found nothing. Either the trail has gone cold, or they’re no longer in Arkham. Perhaps Daniel truly was insane, and you are only following him deeper down the rabbit hole. Every night, you toss and turn as you are subjected to vivid dreams of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

msgid "You chase the Stranger through dark, chilly passageways composed of hundreds of thousands of skeletal bodies. Skulls watch as you run, their mouths rattling a mocking taunt as you pass. The Stranger reaches a solid wall of bone, and is grabbed by bony hands and pulled into the wall. Their mocking laughs reach an awful crescendo."

msgid "You find yourself inside the Arkham Police Department, desperately trying to explain to the desk sergeant what happened in the Ward Theatre. He scoffs and refuses to believe you. “We know what you’re really up to,” he says, and claps a pair of handcuffs over your wrists. “You’re under arrest for larceny. Boys, take ‘em away.” Several other cops flank you and prevent any escape. Your protests go unheard as you are firmly escorted down a flight of concrete stairs and hurled into a cold jail cell. “Maybe some time in lockup will change your story,” the desk sergeant shouts. He slams the door behind him, leaving you with your spiraling thoughts. How did they find out? How could they possibly know?"

msgid "You chase the Stranger up a steep staircase of broken stone, a torrent of rain crashing upon your back as you run. Lightning flashes in the distance. A vortex of swirling black clouds looms above you, threatening to swallow the world whole. The masked man dashes through a wide set of doors atop the stairs, and you follow close behind. The sound of crashing thunder is muffled as the doors close behind you. Looking up, you see a familiar depiction in stained glass. “Beautiful, is it not?” the Stranger says quietly."

msgid "<i>“How could any of this be beautiful to you?”</i>"

msgid "<i>“What exactly am I looking at?”</i>"

msgid "You avoid looking at the stained glass. If this vile man considers it to be beautiful, it is probably some trap meant to ensnare your mind. You clench your fist until your knuckles are white and step forward to confront the Stranger."

msgid "The lights of the theatre dim and a spotlight shines on the stage. “Welcome, ladies and gentleman!” the creature exclaims. Its many tentacles reach across the stage, up into the rafters, and throughout the aisles. It tears the curtains down, and tattered red cloth falls over its bulbous form."
msgstr ""

msgid "You awaken from your fitful dream, sweating and gagging. This cannot go on any longer. You have only one option if you are to continue your investigation. You must find Nigel Engram, director of The King in Yellow, and architect of this madness. Only he will have the answers you seek. You pack your bags and plan your trip to Paris, the City of Lights."

Jordan had first met with Mr. Engram at a café in Montparnasse, “L’agneau Perdu.” You travel there first, hoping to find Mr. Engram…"

msgid "You lose track of yourself within the city as you flee for your life. Your feet move of their own accord. The beating of sinewy wings and screeching of creatures above you spurs you onward. Soon you find yourself running down a narrow avenue, passing a set of heavy iron gates. You are in a dead end—a court with tall, old houses on either side. You turn back toward the entrance to find the shapes of many winged creatures barring your path. They are perched on the gates and on the balconies above, awaiting your doom. Walking with cold, sinister confidence, the man in black opens the iron gate and enters the court. His face gleams in the darkness. His eyes pierce your soul. For a moment, you recognize him for what he truly is. It is the last you remember of that night."

"You can only assume this house belongs to Nigel Engram, the director of The King in Yellow. At last, you have finally found your quarry…and yet, it is little relief to your straining sanity. You feel like a dog being led by a leash, your fate decided by a cruel master who has long kept you in the dark. You push these gloomy thoughts to the back of your mind and knock on Mr. Engram’s door. There is no response but a flock of magpies that scatter from the rooftop at the sudden noise. You try the doorknob, hoping you won’t have to resort to more forceful measures. To your surprise, you find the door unlocked.\n"
"Inside, Nigel’s home is a mess of notes, old books, and strange diagrams. Covering the coffee table in his living room is an old, faded map, bearing many fold creases and tattered edges. It looks to be an incomplete map of the catacombs beneath Paris, or at least a section of it. The food in his pantry is old and rotten. There is no sign of anyone having lived here for years, and yet the ink upon the living room walls is wet and fresh. Over and over, across nearly every inch of the wallpaper, it reads:\n"

"Across the threshold of the doorway stands a tall man with a thick, brown mustache. A familiar silver-handled cane leans against the wall next to his coat hanger. “So it’s you,” he says. “Come in. I have expected you for some time now.” He turns away and walks toward his kitchen. You can hear a teapot whistling, as though he’d been preparing for your arrival.\n"
"You enter his home, unsure of what to do next. This gentle, unassuming man is not quite what you had expected. Nigel’s home is a mess of notes, old books, and strange diagrams. Covering the coffee table in his living room is an old, faded map, bearing many fold creases and tattered edges. It looks to be an incomplete map of the catacombs beneath Paris, or at least a section of it. Mr. Engram returns moments later with hot tea and a plate of cheese and crackers. “I assume you are here to find the path to Carcosa?” he asks, wearing an excited grin. You shake your head in response, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He paces back and forth around the room as he speaks rapidly. “He told me that you would be arriving soon. That I should… Prepare.” Nigel turns toward you as he reaches the wooden door across from you, his eyes flashing. “Don’t worry. All is ready. The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret his cryptic comments. You wait a few minutes for him to return, but when he does not, you begin to worry. Then you notice that mold has already begun to grow over the cheese he’d brought you. “Mr. Engram?” you call out, and you hesitantly knock on the door to his study. There is no response. When you enter the room, you find him hanging from the ceiling fan, his body rotting from weeks of decomposition."

Frustrated at your failure, you return to your hotel to sleep and recover from the horrors of the past few nights. Your fitful dreams return— dreams of Carcosa, of the King in Tatters, and of the shadowy figure whom you had pursued through the streets of Paris. When you awaken, you are no longer in your hotel room."
