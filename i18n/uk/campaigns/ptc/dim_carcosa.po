msgid "You swim to the edge of the water and throw yourself upon the rocky shore, gasping for air. You lie there for some time, utterly exhausted. Every muscle in your body aches. Before you lies a desolate expanse of plain. In the distance, the alien spires of a warped city rise into the clouds. Behind you, the dark surface of the lake from which you’d emerged reflects the glare of two suns. When you peer back into the murky depths, you see no sign of the chapel where you’d made the leap, or of Mont Saint-Michel, or even of Earth. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."
msgstr ""

msgid "You land on a piece of black obsidian stone winding up a dark spire. You cough blood and feel a searing pain in your gut, as though you’d broken a rib. Before you lies a warped, alien city. Its twisting streets and aberrant architecture have no semblance of order or structure. In the distance, a murky lake reflects the glare of two suns. When you look up, the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel peeks just below the clouds, flipped upside-down. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns supreme."

While an investigator has more horror on them than sanity, their “remaining sanity” is considered to be 0."

msgid "You stand atop the balcony of the abbey tower in Mont Saint-Michel, wet wind coursing through your hair. The Pallid Mask lies in your hands, devoid of warmth. You can scarcely bring yourself to look at it. You remember everything now—how it all began, how it ended, and everything in between. There is only one thing left to do. You hurl the mask into the air with all of your strength and watch as it flies into the tempest-tossed waves below."

"A roar of applause startles you awake. The crowd of the theatre rises to their feet, cheering endlessly. Several patrons in the front row are throwing roses to the actors on stage, who are bowing with wide smiles across their faces. A searing headache crawls through your temples. How did you get back here? Were you in the theatre all along? What about the dinner party? The asylum? The catacombs?… Carcosa? Was it all just a terrible dream?\n"
"You exit the auditorium before the crowd rushes to do the same. Dizziness and exhaustion harries your senses. The weight of your lengthy investigation is crushing your mind. By the time you finally reach the lobby, you are clawing your way across the ground. Just then, a man in an elegant suit reaches down and grabs you by your arm, pulling you to your feet. You are about to thank him when you realize who he is. The sight of him causes you to stagger backward in horror momentarily. The actor who plays the role of the Stranger is still wearing his pale, featureless mask. He gives you a wordless bow, then turns and leaves through the Ward Theatre’s front entrance."

"When you awaken, you are sitting in the choeur gothique of Mont Saint-Michel’s abbey. No rain pelts the glass of the windows above, and you hear no thunder, nor the screeching of winged horrors overhead. Somehow, you have escaped. You creep to the door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block the glare of the sun. You stand overlooking beautiful Mont Saint-Michel. Seagulls fly over the abbey under a backdrop of cloudless sky. The waters around the abbey are calm and azure-blue.\n"
"“I’ve been looking all over for you!” You hear a voice exclaim behind you. You turn with a startle. For a moment you expect to see the Stranger and his Pallid Mask, but instead, the boat captain you’d hired to take you to Mont Saint-Michel stands at the edge of the steps, smiling at you. “Are you ready to head back?”"

You creep to the door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block the glare of two suns. You stand overlooking the Lake of Hali. Black stars hang in the heavens above. Beyond, over leagues of tossing cloud-waves, the towers of Carcosa rise behind the shattered moon."

msgid "The outside world will never know how you tried to save them. They treat you with pity, with scorn and contempt, but you know the truth. They are resigned to their hideous fate, but still you try day after day to bring them your message. You must warn them of The King in Yellow, of Hastur and of Carcosa. “Another lost soul,” they say, but they cannot possibly fathom what you have gone through in your attempt to save them. You warn them that he is coming to claim them, but they never believe you. You write of Aldebaran and of the black stars on the wall of your cell, but the words become faded as the years go by. Your warning is never heeded."
