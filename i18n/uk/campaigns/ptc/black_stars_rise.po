msgid "Scenario VII: Black Stars Rise"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dual Agendas"
msgstr ""

msgid "The island commune of Mont Saint-Michel lies off the northwestern coast of France. It is beautiful, elegant, and enigmatic—a place out of a fairy tale. Only this tale is one of horrors and madness. During low tide, you would be able to reach the island on foot by crossing the tidal causeway that emerges from the sea. However, by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much higher than you’d anticipated. Dark clouds cover the sky, and a distant crash of thunder signals the start of the oncoming storm. You find a boat whose captain is willing to take you to the island, and prepare for the ritual to come."

msgid "You recall the night where this all began, and your thoughts drift to the mesmerizing song Ashleigh sang that night. Somehow you remember the lyrics perfectly after all this time, and its haunting melody is ingrained in your mind. “Above the city the storm clouds rage, and waves crash through the gilded cage… Below the earth the salt water seeps, the shadows fall as the red sun sleeps…” Studying the island that lies before you, illuminated by flashes of lighting and assaulted by tumultuous waves, you can’t help but wonder if Ashleigh was singing about this very moment."

msgid "During this scenario, as a [fast] triggered ability, an investigator may remove 1 doom from an agenda in play. (Group limit once per game.)"

msgid "Be aware that some cards from the <i>Black Stars Rise</i> encounter set have multiple versions, some with <i>The Flood Below</i> encounter set icon on their reverse side, and some with <i>The Vortex Above</i> encounter set icon on their reverse side."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sort each copy of the following cards into two separate piles, based on the encounter set icon on their reverse side: Agenda 2a—Let The Storm Rage, Agenda 2c—The Entity Above, Chapel of St. Aubert, and Abbey Tower."
msgstr ""

msgid "You should have two piles of exactly four cards. Each pile should have one copy of each of the above listed cards. The cards in the first pile should have The Flood Below encounter set icon on their reverse side, and the cards in the second pile should have The Vortex Above encounter set icon on their reverse side."
msgstr ""

msgid "Flip each pile over so that only the Black Stars Rise encounter set icon is showing. Randomize the two piles so you cannot tell which is which."
msgstr ""

msgid "Choose one pile at random to remove from the game and one pile at random to use throughout this scenario’s setup. <b>Do not look at the reverse sides of any of the cards in either pile</b>."
msgstr ""

msgid "This scenario does not have an act deck. Instead, it has two agenda decks. One agenda deck is built using agendas 1a, 2a, and 3a. The other agenda deck is built using agendas 1c, 2c, and 3c <i>(remember to use the versions of agendas 2a and 2c that were randomly chosen earlier)</i>."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Both act cards (Act 3a and Act 3c), Beast of Aldebaran, each copy of Tidal Terror, each copy of Rift Seeker, Cloister, Knight’s Hall, Abbey Tower, and Chapel of St. Aubert <i>(remember to use the versions of Abbey Tower and Chapel of St. Aubert that were randomly chosen earlier)</i>."

msgid "Choose one of the two Choeur Gothique locations, at random, and set it aside. Remove the other version of Choeur Gothique from the game."

msgid "Choose one of the two North Tower locations, one of the two Outer Wall locations, and one of the two Broken Steps locations, at random. Put the chosen locations into play. Remove the other versions of those locations from the game. Then, put the remaining locations (Porte de l’Avancée, Grand Rue, and Abbey Church) into play. Each investigator begins play at Porte de l’Avancée."

"During this scenario, there are two agenda decks. One represents a means for you and your allies to open the path to Carcosa, and leads to one of the two set‐aside act cards. The other represents a means for Hastur to escape into our world, and spells demise for Earth.\n"
"When playing this scenario, while there are two agenda decks in play, players must observe the following additional rules:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Whenever 1 or more doom is placed on “the current agenda,” the players may decide which of the two agendas to place this doom on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Doom on cards other than the two agendas (such as enemies, locations, or assets) count towards the doom threshold of <b>both</b> agendas."
msgstr ""

msgid "When one agenda advances, <b>doom on the other agenda is not removed</b>. All other doom in play is removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the doom thresholds of both agendas are satisfied during the “Check doom threshold” step of the Mythos phase, choose only one agenda to advance. Then, once you have completed advancing that agenda, check the doom threshold of the other agenda and advance it if its doom threshold is still satisfied."

msgid "You hold your breath as you swim through freezing water toward the spires below. As you get closer, you see ripples throughout the water, as though you are peering into a reflection upon the sea’s surface. You break through the surface and gasp as air fills your lungs."
msgstr ""

msgid "You marvel at the cloud-waves encircling you and fly toward the spires above. The desolate and inscrutable city of Carcosa towers before you. You suddenly realize you are falling—not floating—and a pulling force takes hold of your body."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you awaken, you are sitting in the choeur gothique of Mont Saint-Michel’s abbey. No rain pelts the glass of the windows above, and you hear no thunder, nor the screeching of winged horrors overhead. Somehow, you had escaped the island’s certain doom. You creep to the door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to block the glare of two suns. You stand overlooking the Lake of Hali. Black stars hang in the heavens above. Beyond, over leagues of tossing cloud- waves, the towers of Carcosa rise behind the shattered moon."
