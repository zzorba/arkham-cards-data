msgid "Upon entering the doorway, you find yourself in a web of icy tunnels, swathed in miasma and dripping with prismatic ichor. Your reflection peers back at you in myriad peculiar angles. Your voice echoes throughout this infinite hall of mirrors. You turn around to discover that your entryway has vanished behind you. Then, in the corner of your eye, you spot a familiar figure traversing the same mists—but, no, that can't be possible. Can it?"

"Professor Dyer is dead. There is no way that can be him. And yet…\n"
"You see him pacing back and forth across one of the reflections, muttering to himself. \"It must be stopped. They cannot do this.\" He pauses, as if in conversation with another, who goes unheard. \"I do not care. It must end at once!\" Poor Dyer. He did try to warn you, you recall. And yet, here you are.\n"

"The student sits at a table in the Orne Library, muttering to himself as he reads: \"I saw it. I know I did. I saw it.\" He begins to doze off, only to quickly shudder awake. The dark rings under his eyes tell you that he has not slept for many days. \"I saw it… it was real…\"\n"

"He is braced against one of the crystalline mirrors, hands shaking as he reloads his rifle. Dirt and soot cover his face and stain his uniform. He looks younger, but no less haggard. \"Sergeant Fredericks,\" another voice snaps him out of his trance. \"Germans broke the line last night. They're circling around. We have to get out of here!\"\n"

"You watch as he studies a map of Antarctica, the regions inside its borders only partially documented. \"It would have to be here,\" he says, pointing to a spot inside a ring sketched hastily in pencil. \"Inside these mountain ranges. But…\" he falters, peering over his shoulder at someone you cannot see. \"That cannot be the case, can it?\"\n"

"The physician examines what you can only assume to be a corpse, the body limp and lifeless. \"Time of death: 14:23. Record it,\" she says, her voice steady and calm. But within the misty reflection, you spot her lip quiver ever so slightly as her task takes its toll on her.\n"

msgid "Mirage"

msgid "The mirage keyword represents locations that are manifestations of your memories and the memories of your companions. These locations have no unrevealed side and therefore enter play with their revealed side faceup. Instead of an unrevealed side, these locations have story cards on their reverse sides. These story cards allow investigators to travel deeper into the strange mirage and unlock new memories in the form of locations or encounter cards. The number indicated by the mirage keyword represents how many clues are required to flip it over, while the card titles in parentheses indicate what memories might appear as a result."

msgid "<i>For example: Prison of Memories has a clue value of 3[per_investigator] and has the following text: \"Mirage 1 [per_investigator] (Base Camp, Deck of Theodosia, University Halls).\" When Prison of Memories enters play, the investigators check which of the three cards indicated by its mirage keyword are already in play or in the victory display. Both University Halls and Deck of Theodosia are already in play, but Base Camp is still set aside. Therefore, the clue value of Prison of Memories is reduced by 2 [per_investigator], meaning only 1 [per_investigator] clues are placed on it when it enters play."
