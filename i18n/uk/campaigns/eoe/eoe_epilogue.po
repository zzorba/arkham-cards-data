msgid "If Roald Ellsworth and Avery Claypool both survived:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You find Ellsworth and Claypool on the aft deck of the Theodosia, enjoying a majestic view of the Atlantic. It has been several days since your escape, and the mood is one of relief, mixed with sorrow and guilt. The two men greet you as you approach, shifting aside to offer you a place to enjoy the view, as well. After a moment of contemplation, you ask what is in store for the explorers. The two of them share a knowing glance. \"A vacation, I think,\" Ellsworth says. \"A very, very long vacation.\"\n"
"\"Nothing but blue skies and warm air,\" Claypool suggests.\n"
"\"Sure. Somewhere that is on a map, preferably,\" Ellsworth adds with a gentle smile.\n"
"\"Really? I was thinking somewhere nice and remote. Just the two of us,\" Claypool hints.\n"
"You chuckle and leave the two of them to their vacation plans. Perhaps there is hope for the lot of you, after all."

msgid "If Dr. Amy Kensler and Dr. Mala Sinha both survived:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You have seen Dr. Kensler face down impossible creatures and nightmarish environs, but it is this final trial that seems to rattle her most. She paces and fidgets and quietly recites sentences until finally, Dr. Sinha arrives. You'd leave her to her privacy, but she requested you stay. \"Mala,\" she says dryly, despite all of the practice. \"I was wondering—that is, I was—I would like to—\" she clears her throat and tries again. \"Would you like to have dinner again, sometime? And perhaps another show?\" she finally manages to say.\n"
"Dr. Sinha rolls her eyes, hiding a smile. \"Yes, you idiot.\"\n"
"Dr. Kensler blinks in surprise. You get the feeling she has never been called such a thing before.\n"
"\"Amy, you are highly astute, incredibly well read, and a true prodigy in your field. But when it comes to this—\" Dr. Sinha motions to and fro, indicating something in the air between them, \"you are somewhat of a dimwit.\"\n"
"To your surprise, Amy chuckles and grins. \"Yes. Yes, I suppose I am.\""

msgid "If Professor William Dyer and Danforth both survived:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Weeks later, you step into Professor Dyer's office, where he and Danforth study an array of old, musty tomes. Some kind of esoteric diagram, filled to the brim with bizarre symbols, adorns the professor's chalkboard. \"It could be this one,\" Dyer says quietly, pointing to a different diagram in one of the tomes. You recognize the book from Dr. Kensler's possessions, and several of the others from the restricted collection of the Orne Library.\n"
"Danforth closes his eyes. \"No, no, no…\" He moves to the chalkboard and begins to erase. \"It is different. Different, different…\" Only then do the two of them spot you in the entrance. You ask them what they're studying this time.\n"
"\"'In a future existence, we shall look upon what we think our present existence, as a dream,'\" Danforth recites from Poe once more, as if in explanation."

msgid "If Takada Hiroko and James \"Cookie\" Fredericks both survived:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To your surprise, you spot both Takada and Cookie in the workshop below deck. Cookie has taken apart his revolver and is cleaning each piece individually, while Takada goes through the aeroplane parts the crew managed to break down during your hasty escape. You watch in secret for a short while as the two banter.\n"
"\"Hand me that cloth, will yeh?\"\n"
"\"I am not your employee, Cookie.\"\n"
"\"C'mon, Roko, it's right there. Jus' grab it and fling it over here.\"\n"
"\"Yes sir, do you wish for me to fetch you a spot of tea as well?\"\n"
"\"Very funny—why the hell'd you throw it all the way over there?\"\n"
"\"You told me to fling it.\"\n"
"\"To me, ya blasted—to me!\"\n"
"You smile to yourself as the back-and-forth continues. The unlikely duo seem more comfortable with one another than anybody else on the crew. Finally, a lull in the conversation gives you the opportunity to reveal yourself. They acknowledge your entrance with curt nods before going back to their work. You ask the pair what they intend to do when they get back to Arkham.\n"
"\"Roko wants to—you tell 'em,\" Cookie says.\n"
"Takada sighs and sits up, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand. \"I… I want to try to look for my father. I have asked Mr. Fredericks to join me.\" The two of them share a knowing glance. \"It is a long shot, I know. He likely crashed into the ocean many years ago. Even so, I want—I need to know. I have his logs. We should be able to find evidence. Something.\"\n"
"\"An' if not,\" Cookie adds, \"still better than sittin' around, waiting to be sent on another fool's errand like this one.\"\n"
"You nod and excuse yourself. As long as they have each other, you think the two of them will be all right."

msgid "If Eliyah Ashevak and the investigators are the only survivors:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Eliyah sits next to the railing near the bow of the ship, his stare distant and troubled. Anyu lays on the deck with him, her head resting on his lap. She is the first to spot your approach, but neither one of them greets you. You say nothing and sit nearby, staring off into the horizon in silence.\n"
"\"It happened again, Anyu,\" he mutters at last, his voice gravelly. \"Everyone is gone. Everyone but us. Why? Why is it always us?\"\n"
"You tell Eliyah it's because the two of them are survivors, like you. Too stubborn to die. He shakes his head.\n"
"\"No. It is a curse. A burden.\" He pets Anyu softly. The dog lifts her head and gazes at you pleadingly. \"I should be dead. Twice over, now.\"\n"
"But that isn't true, you insist. And besides, he has kept Anyu safe this whole time—is that not reason enough to live?\n"
"\"No, it's the other way around,\" he says, a smile threatening to tug on his lips. \"She's the one who saved me that day. She's the one who saves me every day.\""
