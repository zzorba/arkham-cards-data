"Remove any cards of your class from this deck, as well as any cards you have at least one copy of in your deck. If you do not own any of the cards on this list, make appropriate replacements from your collection. <i>(Each class has 2 assets, 2 events and 1 skill, representing the core of that class. Avoid must-have or always-useful cards such as Lone Wolf.)</i>\n"
" Whenever you are instructed to interact with another investigator's deck, instead interact with the dummy deck. When a card from the dummy deck would leave play, instead shuffle it back into the dummy deck."

"The night's chill has reached your bones, soaking through your layers of warm clothing and settling on your soul. Your eyes, by now accustomed to the dim moonlight, spot no movement on the abandoned street. It's long past midnight. It must be past 1 am by now. \n"
"The call had been rather questionable - a muffled, distorted voice, entreating you to meet it at midnight, that the fate of the world depended on it. Outlandish, yes, but the caller knew things, things that almost no-one knows about you. It wasn't quite blackmail, but rather a promise of trustworthiness. A promise that everything would be explained soon. \n"
"You feel a little foolish as you trudge home. Like some cruel trick has been played upon you. Probably you shouldn't have gone, but something made you want to believe the voice on the other end of the phone. Foolish. \n"
"Bright, flickering light almost blinds you. You blink rapidly, and as your eyes adjust the blinding hues resolve into an image of fire and fury. Your home is ablaze, an inferno so fierce and hot that it couldn't not be deliberate. Somebody trying to kill you? But why? \n"
"And if this is an attempt on your life, what does that make the peculiar call you received earlier this evening?"
