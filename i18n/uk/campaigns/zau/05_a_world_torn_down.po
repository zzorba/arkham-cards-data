"Lacking other leads to pursue, you stay awhile to observe the Myriad Gentleman's home. You spend a long time waiting, watching the property's exits for any sign of movement. Sure enough, as the sun sets, a convoy of vehicles sets out from the manor. You follow as best you can, careful not to be spotted. \n"
"Before too long, the Myriad Gentleman reaches their destination. A school, by the look of it. You go to follow them, but before you're able to make it inside, the school is suffused with a dim green glow, rebuffing you, as a muffled chanting flows from the building..."

msgid "Mount Hollyoke Elementary was condemned by Arkham's town council several years ago, but for unknown reasons was never demolished.

msgid "Gaining and Losing Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid "As time becomes increasingly unstable, the number of actions you may take on a turn may also change."
msgstr ""

msgid "Several effects refer to standard actions. A standard action is any action that does not have a limitation on its use, regardless of its source. <i>For example, Finn Edwards has a copy of Leo De Luca in play. He has four standard actions on his turns - the default three and an additional action from Leo - as well as an additional, non-standard action from his investigator ability that can only be used to evade.</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each investigator is considered to gain their actions for the next round in step 4.2 of the upkeep phase. Effects that grant you additional actions on each of your turns are also considered to grant you actions at this point. This means that effects after aninvestigator's turn cannot make them lose actions for the nextround, unless they happen after the the upkeep phase. <i>For example, Finn Edwards is attacked by a Chronophage in the enemy phase. This would cause him to lose an action, but as his turn has ended he has no actions remaining. During the upkeep phase of the same round, he draws the weakness Overzealous; if an encounter card drawn from this effect would cause him to lose actions, this happens as normal.</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a player card effect (such as the Gold Pocket Watch) causes the investigator phase to repeat, investigators are considered to gain their actions for their turns at the start of the phase. If a player card effect allows an investigator to take an additional turn, they are considered to gain their actions at the start of that turn."

msgid "Recording the Time"
msgstr ""

msgid "At various points during this scenario, you will be asked to <i>record the time</i> next to entries in your Campaign Log. To do this, simply record, in brackets, the current agenda number and the number of doom on the current agenda. <i>For example: If there is 4 doom on agenda 1a, you would record the time as (1,4).</i>"

"Tearing apart the first ritual circle, you turn your attention to the other two. The cultists surrounding them advance on you; they don't look like particularly capable fighters, but they outnumber you ten to one. Taking a few cautious steps backwards, you find yourself on the precipice of a swirling, many-hued rift in reality, the untamed schism that was once contained by the arcane circle you broke. It's a way out, maybe, but an unfathomable one...\n"
