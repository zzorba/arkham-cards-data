"A violent tremor knocks you prone. As you clamber to your feet, Ruby suppresses a gasp. A heavy shadow appears, veiled in the sepulchral darkness within the gates. A steady pulse—like a heartbeat—ripples through the city's nightmarish skyline. The ancient monstrosity drags himself on his belly through the gate.\n"
"The gargantuan beast sways unsteadily. He is easily the size of a small mountain, with sickly green skin, an octopoid head and face, and a set of limp, tattered wings. Your vision doubles as you look at him, as if the creature were both here and elsewhere, both metaphysical and physical. The stench of his ancient rotten flesh is almost enough to make you retch.\n"
"The thing's red eyes glow as he gazes down on you. A steady, insistent weight presses down on your shoulders, forcing you to kneel. You hear yourself speaking in a voice not quite your own: \"[tdc_rune_u][tdc_rune_c][tdc_rune_b][tdc_rune_n][tdc_rune_p][tdc_rune_b][tdc_rune_n] [tdc_rune_a][tdc_rune_b][tdc_rune_c][tdc_rune_d][tdc_rune_e][tdc_rune_f]!\""

"\"Look away!\" shouts Ruby. You turn to see your companions also kneeling before the awful dead dreaming god. A warmth spreads through your body as he delves deep into your mind, your memories. The warm feeling gives way to something cold, hateful. Looking up, you see him staring back at you, his fifth eye open.\n"
"You feel his rage. You have taken part of his domain. You must perish."

"\"Look away!\" shouts Ruby. You turn to see your companions also kneeling before the awful dead dreaming god. A warmth spreads through your body as he delves deep into your mind, your memories. Great Cthulhu turns his gaze away from you, northward. In your mind, you see the image of the small green idol on Randall's desk in Arkham. The warm feeling gives way to something cold, hateful. Looking up, you see Great Cthulhu staring back at you, his fifth dreaming eye open.\n"
"You feel his rage at the one who stole part of his domain. They must perish."

"Struggling against the ancient one's terrible will, you rise and help the others to their feet. Great Cthulhu grasps at you with sinewy tentacles as you flee to the water's edge and paddle furiously toward the <i>Cassandra.</i> Once aboard, the ship threads a narrow strait through a gauntlet of risen spires and deadly shoals to reach the open ocean.\n"
"An ear splitting roar echoes across the water. You turn to see the colossal abomination slip greasily into the black water and out of view. You stare down into the fathomless deep, waiting to see five angry red eyes emerge to capsize the ship. The nightmarish skyline of R'lyeh glimmers with pale green fire as it fades into the distance. A minute passes, then ten, then thirty. There is no movement, no stirring in the depths. The abomination may have lost interest, or perhaps gotten tangled in the shoals. Or, at least, so you hope."
