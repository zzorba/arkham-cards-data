"From the moment you step off the train in Alexandria, your hackles are raised. Dark clouds gather over the city, and waves crash ominously against the Mediterranean coastline. But the brewing storm is not what worries you—it’s your tail.\n"
"It started with just a few of them. Local authorities, you suspect. Or at least, that seems to be their cover. They could be Foundation agents keeping tabs on you to ensure you remain on task, or Coterie operatives looking to take out a potential threat. You navigate your way through the streets toward the Windsor Hotel, where you have a room booked for the night, but everywhere you turn, you spot more of them. You begin to formulate a plan just in case. Perhaps you can confront one by surprise, interrogate them, learn what they are after… but your thoughts are interrupted when a group of them beat you to the punch.\n"
"“Welcome to Alexandria, agents. Yes, we know who you are,” one of them says, but to your surprise, he raises his hands and shows that he bears no weapons. Now that you are closer, you can easily spot the telltale scarlet trappings among their persons—ties, cufflinks, and the like. “Don’t worry, we come in peace. One of our number wishes to speak with you. We have a problem in Alexandria that perhaps you can help us with.”\n"
"You scoff, incredulous at the audacity of such a request. You have no intention of walking into the Beast’s trap. “I understand why you’re wary,” the agent says, “but I think you will find this agreement to your liking. If you come seeking the Beast, believe it or not, our goals are aligned. This invitation comes from one much wiser and far less dangerous, I assure you. Come. We have much to discuss.”\n"
"You consider your options, but trap or no trap, you can’t pass up an opportunity to speak with a high-ranking member of the Coterie. Information is your best weapon right now, and no matter what, this can only help to inform you. You agree to follow, but keep an eye on your escorts, just in case.\n"
"To your surprise, the agents lead you by way of a horse-drawn carriage to the Bourse—the stock exchange building in the heart of the city. You follow your escorts through a bustling crowd wearing the finest clothes, up several flights of stairs, and through a locked office door on the top floor of the exchange. Immediately, you realize this must be no ordinary stock exchange, but a Coterie hideout of some kind. The office on the other side is an enormous suite, adorned with a surprising number of ancient relics and Euro-centric art, including a rather large portrait of a knight wearing a suit of scarlet-plated armor."

You’re surprised to find the man to be clearly of European descent, perhaps English or French. Though his hair is graying and thin, and his face wrinkled with long lines of worry, he seems surprisingly spry and large in stature. He rests his hand on a polished silver cane, but doesn’t seem to need it to walk. If you didn’t know any better, you would think him to be much younger than he lets on."

"“I suppose you have many questions. First, introductions are in order. I have gone by several names in my long tenure, but you may simply call me the Claret Knight, as others do. I know why you are here. You come seeking this, do you not?” He unlocks a nearby armoire, and as its door opens, a flash of light illuminates the room. Inside is a crystal vial containing a shimmering sapphire substance. It is, without a doubt, the Key you have come here to find. Immediately, your mind races, brimming with possibility. But with many of the knight’s agents standing right behind you, you decide to stay on your best behavior… for now.\n"
"“We have guarded this implement—the Light of Pharos—for many years. Protected it from those who would use it to harm, rather than guide, humanity. Only we have the capacity to do so. To keep such powers out of the hands of knaves and troublemakers. Now, here is the issue: there is another who desires the Light of Pharos, one who is far less benevolent.”\n"
"The Beast, you suspect aloud. “Indeed,” the knight confirms. “And before you ask—yes, that creature is counted among the members of our esteemed organization.” You wonder aloud why two members of the Coterie might be squabbling instead of working together. “Yes, well, membership requirements have been lax in recent years,” he jokes with a chuckle. “The truth is, I bear no particular fondness for this Beast. Its methods are unsavory. It draws too much unwanted attention.” His eyes, deep and blue as a dark ocean, meet with yours to emphasize his point.\n"
"You remind your host that time is of the essence, and ask where this is leading. “Of course,” he obliges. “As I said, we have guarded this implement for countless generations. It would be a shame for it to fall into the hands of the unworthy or uncouth, would it not? But the Beast draws nigh. It spills the blood of friend, foe, and bystander in its path here. Its path to us. It is after the Light, and as the Light’s protector, I must do everything in my power to stop it. As such, I have summoned you here to strike a bargain.” He nods to one of his agents, who closes the armoire and seals it shut. There is a rush of air, and a sensation of building pressure throughout the room as the door shuts tight. Your ears pop with a painful change of pressure.\n"
"“This is a place of power, one of several throughout the city which we have established to prevent uninvited guests from entering. Had you not been escorted, you might have turned to ash. But any such locus can be destroyed, and then the Beast would descend upon us like a starving wolf. We cannot be everywhere at once. Help us defend the locuses, so that we may retain guardianship of the Light of Pharos. In return, I’ll tell you what you wish to know about our organization. And you will have prevented catastrophe from befalling this fair city, which has seen more than enough calamity already. What do you say? Can we rely upon you to make the right choice?”"

"Upon entering, you are greeted by your host—an elderly man of English or perhaps French descent, wearing a elegant brown coat over an outfit of outdated red formal wear. “Finally, you’re here.” He motions for you to sit. Though his hair is graying and thin, and his face wrinkled with long lines of worry, he seems surprisingly spry and large in stature. He rests his hand on a polished silver cane, but doesn’t seem to need it to walk. If you didn’t know any better, you would think him to be much younger than he lets on.\n"
"“I suppose you have many questions. First, introductions are in order. I have gone by several names in my long tenure, but you may simply call me the Claret Knight, as others do. I know why you are here. You come seeking that which we have guarded for many centuries. But even were I inclined to hand it over—which I am not—you are too late.” He gestures toward a nearby armoire, which has been torn nearly to shreds. Its door dangles from its hinges, and inside it is empty and dark.\n"
"“The Light of Pharos has been our charge in Alexandria for countless years. We have protected it from those who would use it to harm, rather than guide, humanity. But, I am afraid it has been stolen. And as such, until we can recover it, we are at war.”\n"
"The Beast, you suspect aloud. “Indeed,” the knight confirms. “And before you ask—yes, that creature is counted among the members of our esteemed organization.” You wonder aloud why two members of the Coterie might be in conflict instead of working together. “Yes, well, I fought tooth and nail to prevent it from joining our ranks, if you’ll pardon the pun,” he says grimly. “The truth is, I despise this Beast. Its methods are unsavory. It draws too much unwanted attention.” His eyes, deep and blue as a dark ocean, meet with yours as he emphasizes his point.\n"
"You remind your host that time is of the essence, and ask where this is leading. “Of course,” he obliges. “Surely we agree that we cannot let this implement remain in the hands of such a monster. It would be safer here, under lock and key, where it has been for countless generations. As its protector, I must do everything in my power to recover it. As such, I have summoned you here to strike a bargain.” He nods to one of his agents, who shows you a map of the city. Marked in several spots are buildings circled in red.\n"
"“These are locuses—places of power that were established throughout the city to prevent uninvited guests from entering a particular stronghold. They were once linked to this place, but now, this power has been usurped by the Beast. The Light of Pharos is somewhere in the city, protected by our very own magic. If we can destroy each locus and enter the Beast’s lair, we can take back the artifact and retain it here, where it belongs. In return, I’ll tell you what you wish to know about our organization. And you will have prevented catastrophe from befalling this fair city, which has seen more than enough calamity already. What do you say? Can we rely upon you to make the right choice?”"

"“A shame,” the knight intones, his tenor changing almost immediately. “Very well. We shall have to deal with this threat ourselves, and I am afraid I must ask you to leave the city at once.” You protest, but the knight’s agents close in around you. He rises to a stature you did not expect from such an elderly man, his voice commanding the kind of authority mentioned only in myth. “You are no longer guests in my city. We will not suffer a war on two fronts. Depart from Alexandria immediately or suffer the consequences.”\n"
"Although it pains you to leave when your goal lies so close, if what the knight said is true, you would have to break the various locuses around the city in order to claim your prize, and you are surrounded and outnumbered, besides. You decide it is best to exit the Coterie’s stronghold and regroup before making a run at the Key.\n"
"But, as is often the case, fate has other plans. The moment you leave the Bourse, you are accosted by a man in a pinstripe suit and a red fez. Bewilderingly, he flashes a Foundation badge and makes a motion to follow him into a nearby alley. You make sure you aren’t still being watched, then abscond into the alleyway, where the man greets you in English. “Hossam Sirry, at your service. Commissioner Taylor told me you’d be coming. That dossier you got? I put that intel together myself.” You study the man’s face for a moment. Unlike the so-called Claret Knight and his Coterie entourage up in the Bourse, he looks native to the area, with brown skin, dark brown eyes and a chiseled, stubbled jawline. Still, your eyes cannot help but dance warily to the one article of red he wears upon his head. He rolls his eyes and gives a slight chuckle. “Do not worry. I am not with them. You would be hard pressed to find this kind of headwear in any other color.” You let out a sigh of relief. “I take it from the way you were escorted out of there that you didn’t take their offer?”\n"
"You tell Agent Sirry what happened inside the Bourse. “You made the right call,” he says. “Those Coterie dogs have been entrenched in Alexandria for as long as anyone can remember. They think this city is theirs, but it’s not. It belongs to the people. It belongs to us.” His disdain is unmistakable. It’s not just for the Coterie—it’s for the people who aim to wrest control of the city away from those who call it home. “They come here from afar and act like their governance, their occupation, is some kind of gift.”\n"
"Agent Sirry puts a hand on your shoulder. “Let us help one another. Your objective is to claim the knight’s Key for your own, yes? This will also weaken the Coterie’s control over this city. That is a result I can get behind.” You nod in agreement. This conflict may not be as personal for you as it is for Sirry, but you’ll stop at nothing to help."

"Given your refusal to help, it is hard to hold the man’s response against him. Still, you did manage to acquire some information regarding the Key’s whereabouts. You decide it is best to exit the Coterie’s stronghold and make a plan to take down the Beast before he and his people do.\n"

"Agent Sirry puts a hand on your shoulder. “Let us help one another. Your objective is to claim the Beast’s Key before the Coterie does, yes? We can’t let either of them retain the Light of Pharos. It is too important. Come with me. I have resources that can help you.” You nod in agreement. This conflict may not be as personal for you as it is for Sirry, but you’ll stop at nothing to help."

That other creature seems to have fled as well. Still…” His eyes dance to the vessel containing the Key, its light trapped within. “I doubt you’ve seen the last of them. In fact, I’d wager a guess that one or both are hot on your tail. Be careful.”\n"

You hate to leave such a volatile situation behind, but you don’t seem to have a choice. You find it ironic that the Coterie, who claim to only want to protect humanity, would put the people of Alexandria in such danger. It seems there is a wide range of personalities within the organization. Perhaps some may even be swayed to your side. But for now, those in Alexandria seem to be a lost cause. You leave the city in a dour mood, hoping your next assignment goes more smoothly."

msgid "You ask the knight what the Red Coterie is truly about. So far, you have seen its members be both brutal and reasonable. And why all the secrecy? “I have not lied to you. We seek only to protect humanity.” He points to the vault wherein the Light of Pharos is still safely sealed away. “These objects, they are too powerful to be wielded by just anyone, and too precious to be kept unaccounted. I’m sure by now you have noticed the influence of other entities upon our world. Outsiders, we call them. These relics are the only line of defense against such entities. The Coterie keeps them safe, to be used only to do battle with the Outsiders. That is why I could not suffer this artifact to fall into the hands of that beast. Aliki is the one who does most of our research regarding the Outsiders—if you wish to know more, perhaps find her. Last anyone heard from her was around Kathmandu, I believe. But you will need to find a translator if you wish to speak with her. She is cryptic and difficult to understand.” He glances at the portrait of the knight clad in crimson armor that looms behind him. “As for all the red… handling relics of an otherworldly nature is both dangerous and conspicuous. So, we have bound them to one or more articles of clothing, to better blend in with society. The process, for whatever reason, turns them red. Of course, there are other benefits too. Think of it as a… secret handshake, if you will.” He raises an eyebrow as he appraises you. “We have, in the past, inducted new members into our ranks, should they prove themselves both trustworthy and capable, as you have. Perhaps one day you shall bear red upon your person, as well. Now, I believe I have fulfilled my end of this bargain. I once again thank you for your aid. My people will compensate your travel expenses.” With that, the conversation comes to a friendly, if abrupt end."
