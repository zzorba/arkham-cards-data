"You awaken in darkness. A sack is removed from your head and cast aside, and your cheek is squeezed and struck once or twice for good measure. “Wake up,” a sinister voice commands. You blink unconsciousness away and realize, with some panic, that you and your partners are bound to chairs. A gag prevents you from making any noise louder than a muffled cry.\n"
"As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you realize you must be underground. The large, windowless chamber is made of clean, worked stone, lit faintly by mercury vapor lamps. Scarlet tapestries line the walls, along with several glass cases and shelves containing old relics and historical artifacts. Dominating the room is an enormous central table, an elaborate pattern of lines and rings carved meticulously along its surface. Standing around this central table are a host of figures, some familiar to you, others unrecognizable. All of them bear red. Your heart surges in your throat. “You have been brought here to account for your crimes against the Coterie,” the voice states, “or to be commended, if that is the will of the Congress. We will now entertain any who wish to speak on your behalf, or against you.”"

"You would never have found the secret hideout of the Red Coterie without the intel Commissioner Taylor sent you. The compound lies deep underground in the heart of Siberia, not far from the mysterious crater that marks the site of the notorious Tunguska event—a blast, or perhaps impact, the true nature of which has been shrouded in mystery for over a decade. Maybe there is a connection between this strange event and the Coterie’s presence—no, knowing the kind of dangerous artifacts the Coterie possesses, there is no doubt in your mind. The question is: which came first?\n"
"The compound’s entrance is masked by heavy snow and remote wilderness, but eventually, you find it—an unmarked steel door embedded in the side of a snowy hilltop, almost impossible to see from afar. You are surprised to find the door unlocked… but the moment you enter, you are set upon by Coterie guards with suspicious eyes and familiar red clothing. “We’ve been expecting you,” one of them says with a wicked grin. “Come. The Congress is about to begin.”\n"
"You have little choice but to follow. The guards lead you deeper and deeper into the complex, down steep, narrow stairways of worked stone and through dark, drab corridors, until finally you reach a large, windowless chamber lit faintly by mercury vapor lamps. Scarlet tapestries line the walls, along with several glass cases and shelves containing old relics and historical artifacts. Dominating the room is an enormous central table, an elaborate pattern of lines and rings carved meticulously along its surface. Standing around this central table are a host of figures, some familiar to you, others unrecognizable. All of them bear red. The door leading into the chamber slams shut behind you, and your heart surges in your throat. “Your timing is impeccable,” a voice among the gathered Coterie states. “We were just about to begin the vote.”\n"
"You inquire as to the nature of this vote, your mouth suddenly dry. You cannot shake the feeling that you have come here merely to look your own doom in the eyes. “A meeting has been called. To account for your crimes against the Coterie, or to be commended, if that is the will of the Congress. We will now entertain any who wish to speak on your behalf, or against you.” From behind, you are suddenly restrained and a gag is placed over your mouth. “Just a formality, I promise you,” the guard drawls with a grin."

Behind them, his eye sockets are gruesomely hollow. “Foolish girl,” he utters, his words dripping with venom. “A last play for attention?” She scowls at him, gripping the crown of her hat so hard, it crumples beneath her fingers. “Do any of you have any idea what kinds of things this sick bastardo has been up to?

Wrong.” She tips the brim of her hat up so everyone can see her dark brown eyes narrowing directly at the bespectacled man. “Just you.

A cold blade is placed at the edge of your neck. “You who seek to harm our noble cause have been accused and charged with numerous crimes against the Coterie,” a voice states with dreadful gravity. The blade bites against your skin. A trail of blood trickles down your neck. “The punishment is death. May the crimson stain of your legacy be washed away.” You close your eyes and brace yourself.\n"
"Just then: a crash. Shouting and sounds of battle erupt throughout the room, a storm of clashing steel and gunfire. You are sent reeling as your would-be executioner is attacked by an unseen foe. You struggle again to free yourself, but are unable… until moments later, when you are dragged out of the chamber. Your bonds are cut, and you are brought to your feet by none other than the woman in the vermillion veil herself. Ece ushers you down the hall, whispering over the chaos of the battle. “We have to get out of here.” Several of the others who wear red follow in your wake, looking over their shoulders the entire time.\n"

"You ask her to start again, slower. “He attacked us,” she says, meeting your gaze as you duck into a quiet hall filled with scarlet tapestries. “The others fought him off, but… there was something strange about him. He was not human. It was something else entirely. It stole as many implements as it could and escaped, like…” she shudders. “…just like one of the creatures we seek to destroy.”\n"

With some reluctance, you are brought before the ceremonial table and given the chance to speak on your behalf. Your eyes seek out the members of the Coterie you know to be genuinely good, and as soon as the room is silent, you appeal to their sense of justice. For too long, the Red Coterie has allowed its members to wreak havoc and spread misery among the people simply to further their own ends. For too long, they have used their collected power not to guard humanity, but to plague it. As you speak, several of the people you have met nod amongst themselves. “They’re right,” the girl in the red coat announces, gesturing at several of the others who look on with sneers. “You all say you are motivated by a duty to humanity, yet you tolerate the presence of those who only do others harm. If this is the kind of organization you really are, I no longer wish to be a part of it.”\n"

For a moment, you fear that the ensuing chaos will be impossible to survive.\n"

Seeing the wisdom in flight, your foes carefully filter out of the room, whispering, mumbling and hissing with vitriol. “You may wear red,” one of them spits, “but you will never be strong enough to stop what is coming without us. You are weak. You will be the doom of us all.”\n"

"“If you no longer wish to be a part of this organization,” Professor Masai states, “You know where the door is.” Your detractors sit in hateful silence as the proceedings continue. The knight beckons you forward and inducts you into their order in a lengthy, solemn ritual. “With red we are bound,” he recites with gravitas, “through red we are one. Thus in red do we embrace our kin and our ken.” You are told to forsake your old life to take up a new one, for the betterment and guidance of all humanity. You think on your life, on the events that led you to this place, on those you hold dear and the many things you will leave behind. Then, you acquiesce."

With some reluctance, you are brought before the ceremonial table and addressed by the Congress, who tell you that you will be spared so long as you declare your intent to aid and never again interfere in their mission. Given the alternative, you have no choice but to agree. The members of the Coterie you have wronged exclaim in protest, but it is clear they are outnumbered."

"Before the next member is even given the chance to speak, a figure emerges from behind the man with the red gloves, and something small and dark is placed against the base of his skull. There is a thunder in your ears as the gunshot rings out across the chamber. The man’s face explodes not in grotesquerie, but in a flood of distorted mist that crests outward and reforms above the man’s hollowed body. It takes the vague shape of a many-armed spiral, like a galaxy of stars pinching all of reality around its otherworldly form. The clothes the Red-Gloved Man previously wore crumple to the ground, empty.\n"
"The rest of the assembled Coterie draw their weapons and attack the entity, but it quickly escapes the chamber, reassembling its ectoplasmic form before your very eyes on its way out. Several more of the things follow suit, the attire of their previous forms falling, limp and hollow, to the floor. From the shadows emerges the true figure of the Red-Gloved Man. “They are here,” he states with surprising nonchalance, reloading his sidearm. “Among us. Perhaps the rest of you might have noticed, had you kept your gaze on our mission.” He shares with you a knowing glance and the barest hint of an impish grin. “These ‘accused’ are to thank for my return to this realm. Without them, you might all be dead. This trial is over.” There is no debate whatsoever.\n"
"The gag is taken out of your mouth, and your bindings are cut. You are brought before the ceremonial table, standing by the man’s side. “What are they after? Where have you been?” one of the Coterie asks.\n"
"“They are after our world. Perhaps every world,” he replies, pulling his scarlet gloves taut around his hands. “But now is our chance to strike back. To follow them to their home and end this threat, once and for all.” Nods and murmurs of consent ripple throughout the assembly."

"Before the next member is even given the chance to speak, the Red-Gloved Man reaches out to grip their skull with uncanny strength, his arms lengthening into spindly wires of ectomatter. He crushes their skull inside the palm of his hands, staining his gloves a deeper crimson than ever before. The body slumps to the ground, and chaos ensues.\n"
"You watch in horror as more of the assembly begin to contort and reshape themselves, ambushing everyone around them in a macabre display. A storm of shouting, clashing steel, and gunfire erupts throughout the room. Each slain member of the Congress is erased in their entirety. You are sent reeling as your captors, too, are expunged from reality. You crawl along the ground as the fray rages on, eventually finding a shard of glass upon which to cut your bonds. By the time you free your companions and rise to your feet, the entities have fled. The last thing you see is the shapeless elongated remnants of the Red-Gloved Man escaping out the door you came from.\n"
"You survey the damage, but surprisingly, there isn’t much to look at. Save for you and a few articles of discarded and forgotten red attire, the chamber is completely empty.\n"
"To your horror, you recall none of their names or monikers. Not a single one."

"With the trial proceedings over, the Congress finally reaches other affairs. “There is still the matter of the Outsiders,” one among them states. “We have assembled our strength in order to prepare for the inevitable, but how can we be certain our dimension is of any interest to them? We cannot seek to understand such abstruse entities.”\n"
"You chime in, telling the Congress of everything you have seen during your travels and your operations with the Foundation: the strange happenings across the globe have only grown in frequency, and you have reason to believe they are intelligent and malicious—not mindless and incomprehensible. What’s worse, they appear to be after the very same keys as everyone else.\n"
"“If they are stirring, preparing for war,” another member declares, “then we must do the same. We have among our assembly bearers of the most powerful artifacts this order has uncovered. Let us put them to good use and exterminate this threat once and for all.” Nods and murmurs of consent ripple throughout the assembly.\n"
"“But if they are intelligent entities as our new friends claim they are, how could they possibly know so much of our inner workings?” Your detractor argues. A dreadful hunch stirs in your mind. You scan the room and remark that one among the Congress is missing. The rest of the assembly follows your gaze, with several of them standing to search the chamber more thoroughly. One of them confirms your suspicions by raising a single red glove, discarded and forgotten as though mundane, immaterial.\n"
"The woman in the vermillion veil is the first to understand your thread of logic. “Spread out,” she shouts, her voice warbling. “Find him. Learn where he is headed. And be ready for anything.”\n"
"It doesn’t take long before the doorway is found—a shimmering portal of extradimensional energy, ebbing with eldritch power. “It’s closing,” one of the others observes. Indeed, the doorway seems to be shrinking as it steadily swirls, and soon enough there will be nothing left of it. “We don’t have much time.”"
