msgid "You turn your attention to your surroundings. Though the creatures that ambushed you are nowhere to be found, Alejandro lies on the ground nearby, stirring into consciousness. To your surprise, he appears just as confused as you are. At first, it seems as though he recalls nothing of the previous expedition or the Eztli relic, but then his eyes suddenly spark with recognition. He grips your shoulder tightly and gazes at you as though for the first time in years. “I do remember! We shared one mind for some time, the creature and I. It wished to find the Eztli relic, though for what purpose, I do not know.” He slumps backward against the stone wall, recovering from the sudden influx of memories. “You believed me at every turn, even when the creature had control. You saved me from that abysmal place and brought me back to humanity. For this, I cannot begin to repay you.” He shakes your hand vigorously, filled with a sudden and intense resolve. “We will right all of this, you and I. Then, we will tell the world what we have seen.”"

msgid "The narrow steps on the other side of the stone doorway seem almost endless. Though a dim red glow emanates from deeper within the cavern, no matter how many steps you traverse, the glow does not brighten. It almost seems to grow more distant with each step, mocking your tenacity. After a short while, you come to a small ledge where a stone gate bars your passage deeper into the cavern. The gate bears a familiar carved pattern, faded from age and disrepair, and seeping with an oddly discolored purulence."

msgid "The situation sparks your memory, and you consult the expedition journal. The pattern is similar to one found in the Eztli ruins. Using your chalk and the drawings in your journal as a reference, you restore the glyph in its entirety, and the grooves glow brightly once more. The stone gate lifts on its own, and you are able to continue onward."

msgid "You are unsure how to proceed. After debating the merits of each of your options, you decide that brute force may be the only solution. It takes all of your strength to lift the stone, and you open the way forward for each of you one at a time. It is no simple task, and your body aches tremendously from the effort."

msgid "Hours later, you are almost too weary to go on. Every inch of your body aches with intense pain. There is nothing in this desolate cavern to eat but the occasional wild mushroom, and although temptation gnaws at your insides, you cannot tell which are toxic and which are healthy…"

msgid "The poison has spread to nearly every part of your body. Your skin pales, and you are covered in cold feverish sweat. Simply rising to your feet requires a tremendous effort, and you get no rest at night despite your exhaustion. It won’t be long now before the poison claims your life."
msgstr ""

msgid "After descending hundreds and hundreds of steps, you decide to stop and rest. Though your watch tells you that night has fallen, the lack of natural sky is starting to affect your internal clock. With no flat ledge in sight, each member of your party claims one of the many narrow steps to sleep on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sleep does not come easily for you. Barely any layers protect you from the bitter cold of the underground cavern, and you lie shivering for hours before exhaustion finally claims you. You awaken every hour or so as the shifting of your body almost causes you to tumble off your stone perch. When “morning” comes, you are even more weary than you were the previous night."
msgstr ""

msgid "Though you long for a proper bed, at least your blanket protects you from the frigid chill that permeates the cavern. When “morning” arrives, your body longs for more sleep, but you know you must press onward and reach the Nexus as fast as you can…"
