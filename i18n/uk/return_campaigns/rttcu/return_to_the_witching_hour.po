"You watch as Anette—the leader of the coven—assembles her priestesses once more around the fire. Together, they complete the last rites of their spell. The chill wind becomes a flurry, and their chanting echoes throughout the woods.\n"
"With their spell complete, a dark gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing. Shadows from behind the treeline suddenly twist and coil around the witches, tugging at the edges of their cloaks. One by one, the shadows twist and pull each of them into the darkness beyond… all except one.\n"
"The witch named Erynn lingers for a moment, peering into your eyes as though to discern your intent. \"If you are true, meet me where our ancestors lie buried. There we can talk.\" Then, she is gone. You are left with only the soft glow of moonlight to guide you home."
