"You scour the newspapers in the days you are confined to the hospital bed for recovery.  Throughout all of them, you can't find any mention of the catastrophic events that nearly consumed Arkham.  You had hoped to preserve the city as much as possible, but it's almost insulting how little remains to prove your mission's success.  The possibility of it all being an invention of your own mind occurs, but you have no time to consider before the nurse returns to your bedside.  \"Excuse me, but if you're feeling well enough, a visitor is here to see you.\"  You sit up in bed with a surge of excitement as Alice enters your room with a small smile.  You both wait for the nurse to give you some privacy before she clasps your hand tightly.\n"
"\"You've done it!\" Alice breathes, trying not to shout with joy.  The relief on her face is plain to see, and she looks far better than she did when you first saw her on the train and in the aslyum.  \"I truly can't thank you enough, especially as the evidence of all your struggles has all been returned to Wonderland.  You've done me - and the world at large - an incredible service.\"  You assure Alice that most of your adventures seem to escape the public's eye, but you would have done it all again in spite of the risks.  Alice settles down onto your bedside, and for a brief moment, her smile dips with sadness.  You ask Alice how she's been holding up amid all this, as the key piece of Gurathnaka's plot.\n"
"\"I don't quite know yet,\" she replies with a far-off look in her eye, \"I may never be the same again after all that happened, and this may not yet be the end.  I know that the shadows aren't gone for good.  I can still feel them grasping at the edges of my dreams.\"  Alice looks back to you gratefully and her smile returns.  \"But for the first time in over a decade, I can sleep without fear.  Both for myself and for the world around me.\"  You think back on your journey through Wonderland, and you ask Alice about what has befallen her strange dreams."

msgid "\"But please, tell me of what happened while you were in Wonderland,\" Alice pries gently, \"even if nobody else in the world believes the sacrifices you made for them, I know them to be true.\"  You begin to weave the tale of your journey, and Alice listens intently, as if hearing of Wonderland for the first time again.  You soon discover that your audience has doubled, as the ethereal grin of the Cheshire Cat appears above Alice's shoulder, and its head materializes from time to time, listening as eagerly as Alice herself.  The minutes pass until finally, the nurse intrudes once more.  \"I'm afraid that visiting hours have ended,\" she says cheerfully before ducking out to pass the same message onto other rooms.  Alice rises with a final clasp of your hands, resolution clear on her face.  \"I've decided,\" she states plainly, \"I'm going to remain here in Arkham.\"  You raise your eyebrow in surprise.  Few people who know the mysteries and horrors of this town live to recount them, and fewer still willingly face more.  \"I've learned from several others in the city here that Arkham has many mysteries of its own.  If I can help to solve even one of them, then perhaps I can begin to repay you for your kindness and bravery.\""

"Hope you're all still sane!  And even if you're not, I hope you enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland campaign.  It's always been one of those stories that mixes whimsy and unease in just the right amounts, and it makes no secrets about madness.  The Alice stories have had darker interpretations in the past, from American McGee to Tim Burton, but each had their own stories that they wanted to tell.  My goal for this campaign was to stay as true to the books as I could while making it an adventure worthy of the Arkham Horror investigators.  I didn't want to just change Wonderland's madness; I wanted to add it to Lovecraftian madness instead.\n"
"I created the bulk of this campaign while the official Dream-Eaters campaign was still being released, and I intentionally avoided reading into it until I had the basics for the Wonderland gameplay set.  If there were going to be two campaigns about dream journeys and irritating cats, then I wanted to make sure that this one wasn't being a copycat.\n"
"There were three main challenges in creating the campaign.  First, I wanted to include everything from the Alice books that I possibly could, and to stay as true to those characters as I could.  The stories have an expansive cast, and everyone has their favorites, and I hopefully succeeded in doing each of them justice.  Some unrelated characters and stories had to be combined for the sake of individual scenarios, but in a sense, it was the only way to fit everything in.  In another sense, it helped with the second challenge: making the middle six scenarios scale properly from either side.  The interludes allowed me to give a spotlight to some characters that didn't fit into the scenarios while ramping up the difficulty both ways.\n"
"The third challenge was making Alice herself both relevant and central to the story without making her more important than the investigators, in a sense.  In my mind, she was important enough to be more than just an ally, so she became a full investigator, but only for the final scenario.  By including her fragments in each scenario and her indirect assistance in the interludes, it gave the players that she was accompanying them in spirit, and made her involvement in the final scenario a little more personal.\n"
"As a side note for the mythos involvement, I chose Gurathnaka specifically because there was little information other than that it was a shadowy eater of dreams.  This gave me plenty of room to improvise with the story.  Gurathnaka was created by Matthew Grau for the futuristic CthulhuTech setting, but future mythos must have been past mythos as well.  An ancient one's ambition to eat more than just dreams made the perfect catalyst for the campaign.\n"
"Thanks again for playing!"
