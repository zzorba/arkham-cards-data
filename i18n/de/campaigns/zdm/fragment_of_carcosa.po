"There is no time to waste. As if it were muscle-memory, you adorn the makeshift shrine by installing one of the quantum shards in the center. Several of the golden discs obtained from the Mi-Go must be placed in front — aligned to form a syzygy. With the components in order, you pronounce the unspeakable message from Earth:\n"
"<center>\"Let the red dawn surmise</center>\n"
"<center>What we shall do,</center>\n"
"<center>When this blue starlight dies</center>\n"
"<center>And all is through.\"</center>\n"
"The golden discs begin trembling, building momentum until they all turn upright and begin to roll around the shrine in one direction. The quantum artifact's hue shifts into a yellow glare before glowing an intense and dense red. The discs spin around and around the surface at different, but consistent speeds, until they finally slow down to a crawl and fall over simultaneously. Then, as suddenly as it began, the red shard erupts in a fog of nebulous gas, blinding you in its flurry.\n"
"When your eyesight returns, all that remains are the golden discs resting at various locations across the floor. You instinctively recognize this as a schematic of the solar system. Upon closer examination, a single remnant of the purple shard remains between what you believe is Jupiter and Saturn's orbits. K2-PS187 confirms that the depiction is accurate to the current star-time — and begins plotting a course towards the asteroid.\n"
"On the way there, you think of the different worlds you have visited and many adventures you have experienced, both in this world and in your own. Throughout every interaction, every quest, is the underlying sense of hope and optimism for the future. This future does not deserve to become another pawn to the mad king, and you intend to stop that from happening.\n"
"When you arrive, the asteroid does not resemble what you had expected. The egg-shaped asteroid is about 4 km at its widest, and looks awfully… normal. The yellow color is closer to a murky brown than gold. It is littered with craters and cavities, battered by the harshness of space. Without delay, you suit on and descend onto the surface of Fragment, ready to face the Royal Princess of Carcosa…"

"In this scenario, you may be instructed to flip a location to its other side. When this occurs, simply flip the location, keeping all tokens, attachments, investigators, enemies, and other cards on that same location (which will have a different name). Then, add clues on that location up to its clue value.\n"
"Locations with \"Cannot be flipped.\" will simply ignore the instructions to flip it, and will not prevent abilities from triggering."

msgid "When you finally awaken, in the distance, the alien spires of a warped city rise into the clouds. Behind you, the dark surface of a lake reflects the glare of two suns. You call out to K2-PS187 for help, but there is no response this time. This isn't another simulation, you are imprisoned in the realm of Carcosa, with no way out to save the solar system."

msgid "You wake up in cold sweat back in the cryo-chamber. While you are confused and disoriented, K2-PS187 explains that you have been in a coma for over 2 months after you have decided to enter your own mind. Your experience on that asteroid, the true nature of Hastur — it was too real to be imagined, it must have been forged from fragments of the cultist's memories. Regardless of the circumstances, you now know of the impending doom of the solar system, and understand what you must do: Save as many as you can before the inevitable."

msgid "When you finally regroup back on the Tatterdemalion, all you can think of is all the time you could have saved if only you remembered the real threat you face. The sun only has a few years left to shine, and most of humanity is oblivious to its imminent demise. In the face of this impending doom, you know what you must do: Save as many as you can before the inevitable."
