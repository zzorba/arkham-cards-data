msgid "The expedition's reunion on the beach is decidedly dour, underscored by the rolling fog. One of the crew members you left behind to tend the boat is dead, according to the others, she was murdered when the remaining rations were stolen by starving pilgrims. Thankfully, the <i>Cassandra</i> is intact. You have barely enough food remaining to make it to the mainland. Andy and Ruby discuss their findings as the rest of the expedition bandage wounds and begin loading the <i>Cassandra</i> for the voyage home. Once the ship is loaded, you join Andy and Ruby on the shore."

"\"Just how much of that ugly chicken scratch did you decode?\" Ruby asks. Andy is hunched over the obsidian slate, making notes in a leatherbound notebook. In the evening half-light, the glyphs on the slate glow like pale fire. Andy leafs through several waterlogged pages and places a bloody slip of paper on the stone. \"Enough to decode this. I found it on the body of one of the pilgrims. It roughly translates to this,\" he hastily scribbles the translation on a fresh page and holds it out to you. It reads:\n"
"<center><fancy>\"That is not dead which can eternal lie</fancy></center>\n"

"With your own account, Ruby and Andy help you slowly piece together a narrative across the various friezes and artifacts found in the ancient city. A common theme emerges: an alien civilization from far beyond the stars, an ancient war before history itself, the sinking of R'lyeh, the \"death\" and prophesied return of an ancient god named <b><i>Cthulhu</i></b>.\n"
"Andy points to the central spire. The obsidian gates in the base are swung wide open. A faint but sharp smell of decay wafts out of them. \"The crew members who stayed behind say those doors opened a week ago. Someone went inside, but they never returned,\" Andy says. He shares a few translations he made of rubbings from the gate. \"This one describes a glorious rebirth, a risen sleeper, and the return of the great old ones. It claims he will take back what is his: every part of R'lyeh that was stolen, every corner of his domain.\"\n"
"\"This thing—Cthulhu—is dead. Or asleep. I'm not sure; the details are hazy at best. But with the city and everything else in it awakening, I imagine it's only a matter of time until he awakens as well. He's called followers here from their dreams. And judging by the smell, he's in <i>there</i>,\" the reporter points to the obsidian gates.\n"
"After a long pause, Ruby stands up.\n"
"\"It wouldn't be much of a heist if we left the doors open,\" she winks. I say we lock this thing up before we sail off into the sunset. Who's with me?\""

"The gargantuan form of Cthulhu falls backwards into the central pool His flabby clawed hands grasp at the edges of the pool, failing to find purchase, as his form sinks below the black water. The five glowing red eyes, distorted by the water's surface, slowly fade from view. And, just as suddenly as it started, all is quiet and still.\n"
"You emerge from the obsidian gates and walk to the edge of the shoreline. At long last, you're ready to leave this city behind, bring these artifacts back to Arkham, and move on with your life. As you climb aboard the <i>Cassandra</i>, you look back at the blasphemous skyline, outlined against the setting sun like the spine of an ancient beast. The turbid waters churn as the ancient city begins to descend, almost imperceptibly, to be reclaimed by the ocean. Both the dreamer and his house in R'lyeh have been laid to rest.\n"
"\"I wonder what Mr Tillinghast planned to do with those artifacts,\" Andy muses. \"Probably sell 'em\" Ruby says, a cigarette clenched between her teeth. Closing your eyes, you turn back to the cabin. Perhaps tonight, for the first time in months, you'll enjoy a deep, dreamless sleep."
