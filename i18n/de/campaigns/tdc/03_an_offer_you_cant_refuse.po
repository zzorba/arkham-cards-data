msgstr ""

msgid "\"What you have recovered is no mere curio. It was bought at great expense from a dealer in Egypt, who inherited it from a relative who bought it in Peking, you know how it goes,\" Randall smirks as you admire the ancient artifact. It is a vaguely humanoid figure, sitting in a stooped position, with a heavy, octopoid head and squid-like features. There is something malevolent in its expression, something unwholesome in the very way it was sculpted. You find it difficult to look away."

"\"This is a singular relic of prehistoric, dare I say, pre-human origins,\" Randall's voice breaks the spell. The rest of the eccentric antiquarian's story boggles the mind. He describes a record of some ancient cosmic struggle, and how he believes that all of earth is on the cusp of an apocalypse, much like the one that destroyed the statue's creator.\n"
"In all of human history—in every separate mythology—there exists a story of a great flood. A cataclysm. There are legends of a great city-state: a bastion of knowledge and might, that sank beneath the waves. Humankind has named it many things. Atlantis. Mu. Lemuria. But its true name, a name that predates history, is <i><b>R’lyeh</b></i>.\n"
"\"Through much painstaking research, and the assistance of a mad sailor named Gustaf, I have pinpointed the relative coordinates of the ancient city. A stretch of ocean in the South Pacific where many sailing vessels have shipwrecked or disappeared with no explanation. Which brings me to my offer. I need someone bold and resourceful to lead an expedition to the ancient city. Someone to bring back evidence of its ancient knowledge, study its secrets, record its wonders. I need that person to be you\" Randall says, looking to you, then to Ruby and Andy.\n"
"\"Should you accept, I shall absolve you of any remaining debt and provide you enough money to retire comfortably. <i>Very</i> comfortably. And, of course, lend my assistance for your <i>other</i> concerns.\"\n"
"Your mind wanders back to those other \"concerns.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "You narrow your eyes at Randall. There's something he's not telling you. Some catch. There's always a catch with Tillinghast. Just as there's always one more job to be done. You ask him what it is and he sighs. \"I thought it was obvious, but this expedition is likely to be rather perilous. Which is why I thought to entrust it to you. You've proven yourself to be quite resourceful. And as I said, I intend to reward you handsomely\""

"There has to be a catch. Tillinghast wouldn't offer such tempting bait otherwise. You're through with him. You shake your head no.\n"
"\"Then get out,\" Tilhnghast says icily, pointing to the door. \"I have no further use for you. Rest assured, however, that if you speak a word of this to anyone, you will regret it.\" Without a word, you walk out of the shop, leaving behind whatever wonders—and dangers—Tillinghast had in store for you."

"Whatever his reasons for burying the lede, the offer is too tempting to refuse. Ruby and Andy nod along with you in agreement. Tillinghast's face breaks into a familiar smirk. \"How lovely. I'd hoped you would say yes. Truly, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. I assure you this will change <i>everything.</i>\"\n"
"After Andy negotiates for a comprehensive supply of film, and Ruby ups her commission,Tillinghast outlines the plan for the expedition. Tomorrow, a train will take you to San Francisco, where the <i>Cassandra</i> will sail you down to the provided coordinates in the South Pacific. There is an excited, almost childlike glee as the antiquarian outlines the details. \"I've sent supplies enough to last the entire expedition several months if needed. That said, be prepared for anything.\""

The money he's promised for this job will finally get you back on your feet. You know he's good for it."

Months ago, you recognized the unblinking eye set in the stained glass of Tillinghast's shop from your dreams. It was a sign. Whatever guides your hand led you here. And so when Tillinghast asked for the first \"favor,\" you acquiesced easily, and when he asked for the second, you dutifully responded. There have been so many favors. But something feels different about Tillinghast's latest request. You can't help but feel that this is the reason you were led here. You have no choice but to say yes."
