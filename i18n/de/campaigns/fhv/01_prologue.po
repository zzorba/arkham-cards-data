"<blockquote><fancy>June 1926</fancy>\n"
"Miskatonic Survey, June 1926. Members Marquez, Musgrave, et alii.\n"
"After three separate reviews by Miskatonic University’s board and grant commitee, we have reached Hemlock Isle. Our driver took us across a natural land-bridge they call the “causeway”—only traversible at low tide—to a small fishing village called Akwan. Bertie showed the locals several sketches and photographs of the alkaline blossom, but the locals would have none of it. Or maybe none of him. Bertie is exceedingly chipper.\n"
"The survey consists of myself, my assistant Bertie Musgrave, and some contacts of Dr. Armitage. He insisted they accompany me as part of the terms of the grant. I just hope they don’t get in the way. The island is private property and has been off-limits to visitors for some time—until now. The locals are advertising some kind of festival throughout New England, even as far south as Boston and Arkham.\n"
"There were no lodgings in Akwan, and according to local rumors, camping on the island is a risky affair. The locals were unresponsive when I pressed further, but I was at least able to procure a map of the island as well as some basic supplies. We were all but resigned to pitching a tent west of Akwan, but then we met a young man named Theo who offered us lodging in a village called ‘Hemlock Vale’.\n"
"<right><fancy>Dr. Rosa Marquez</fancy></right>\n"
"</blockquote>\n"
"“But really, I think you’re gonna love it here,” Theo shouts from the truck window. Dr. Marquez—athletic and well-tanned at 40—closes her survey journal and looks up at the sky. “I don’t know anyone who doesn’t love Hemlock Isle,” Theo continues. “And I don’t know why we haven’t invited folks sooner! I assume you’re here for the Feast.”\n"
"“Is this feast some sort of local tradition?” Bertie says in a crisp British accent. The breeze stirs the round man’s shock of thick hair as he leans forward eagerly.\n"
"“This is the first one ever! Everyone in the Vale’s pulled out all the stops so everyone feels welcome. We’re just so excited to have visitors!” The young man laughs as your truck crests the hilltop. Hemlock Isle stretches away in every direction.\n"
"To the south, glistening black lakes dot a tangled marsh all the way to the coast. Up north, whitecapped hills gather around jutting obsidian rocks, resembling an exposed spine. Past a huddle of hills, the dense western forest grows up the rocky hillside, bisected by a wide river. And even further north, past the white hills, is a bleak rocky coastline at the edge of the slatey Atlantic waters.\n"
"The road takes you past lush farmland into a village nestled in the hills. Gaudy floral arrangments and brilliant ribbons hang from rooftops and fenceposts. A prismatic rainbow shimmers in a cloudless sky, lending the scene an idyllic air. As the truck rolls to a stop in the crossroads, locals and children in white-gold cloaks and wooden animal masks gather around you, grinning from ear to ear.\n"
"“Willkommen!” An imposing woman with steel-gray hair and a white-gold cloak cuts through the crowd. “Welcome to Hemlock Vale. I am Mother Rachel, and these are my people. What brings you here?”"

"The matron smiles benevolently. “And we are overjoyed to have you. Our food and shelter are yours. The Feast is in three days’ time; we ask only that you open your heart and mind to experience our way of life.”\n"

"Mother Rachel’s friendly mask breaks for just a moment as she registers your response. “Surveyers. I see. You are quite welcome here as well. But mind your place. We have rules. Do not harm anyone in the Vale and we will not harm you. Keep to the village at night, and take care out in the wilderness. Nature is crueller here.”\n"
"Down the road, a small doe walks alongside a pair of children, almost as if to contradict the matron’s words. Before you can ask her more, a gaggle of locals descend on the truck, eager for news from the mainland. After fielding multiple questions about sports outcomes and elections, Dr. Marquez suggests you split up to acquaint yourselves with the locals. “Ask around about the island and meet back here in an hour.”"

msgid "Hemlock Vale is generally a safe place. During these preludes, there is no encounter deck.

msgid "“What are the Children of the Stars?” Mother Rachel echoes your question, bemused. Dust swirls in the harsh light through the intricate stained glass. “I suppose if I had to put it simply: We all are. ‘Begotten by light,’ I often say. Like heavenly bodies, we each have a place in this life, a purpose. There are some whose place is to understand. And others whose place is to watch.” The older woman smiles faintly as a line of children file into the chapel to sit cross- legged near the altar. “And now, it is my place to begin storytime.”"

"“You barely need to leave the Vale before you see something odd,” she puts one hand on her hip. “I’m planning to go up to Pearl Ridge today. Something up there turned the trees to glass. I’m not sure if that’s what you’re looking for, but it is definitely unique.”"

"“Ah, marbles. I thought you were Theo. Lay off, Digby!” he tells the dog, then drops to one knee to gather the debris. “Sorry about that. I’m Simeon. My ma’s always busy cooking for Auntie Rachel,” he scratches a red, raised swirl of hardened skin on his neck. “Auntie Rachel said we’d get 5 lashes if we litter in the Vale.” You ask him about any points of interest on the island. “You’re not allowed to go to the mines up in Pearl Ridge. I claimed them for my secret society,” the young man says."

You note the worn copy of Walden under his arm, and ask about any local points of interest. “I know it’s rather unconventional, but my family’s old house has a...peculiar infestation,” he seems to chew his own words. “If you could exterminate whatever it is rather than study it, I think we’d all be in your debt.”"

That is, if sweet William actually listens,” they say sourly. Bertie fields several more questions about current goings-on in New York’s high society—of which he knows nothing—before asking River about points of interest. “I hear North Point Mines has some fascinating crystals,” they answer."

Judith Park. I’m the muscle around here. Which mostly means shooting rowdy animals. They look all nice and friendly during the day, but they get weird at night. Some of ‘em have started to look a little strange, too. Occasionally, one’ll wander into the village and I have to introduce ‘em to Ol’ Jomo.” She brandishes a hunting rifle almost as long as she is tall. Impressed, you ask if she’s available for hire. The young woman sizes you up. “Your friend Marquez hired me to escort her to Eastwick Bog today. Be prepared if you come along.”"

"“Hold on, hold on,” Theo says to the worker, pressing a cold cloth to her forehead. After another pained laugh, she passes out. You ask Theo what happened. “It’s kind of like heatstroke, except more like uh—you sort of work yourself into a good mood, and then it’s, well.” He sighs. “I don’t really know what it is. Sometimes, people just get sick.”\n"
"Several locals carry the worker away to a nearby shed. After some banter, you ask Theo about any good areas to survey local wildlife on Hemlock Isle. He smiles broadly. “My sisters and I saw the biggest horseshoe crab on Akwan Shoreline. I don’t know if it’s still there, but I swear it was the size of a buggy. I have some family business in Akwan if you wanna tag along today.”"

"Blossoming garlands hang from every eave of the Boarding House. A succulent smell wafts out of the front door: meat pies and beer brewing. The proprietor introduces herself as Ms. Olmstead and offers you a room. “I keep my eye on happenings around town. If you wanna know what folks get up to in the Vale, I’m happy to help.” When you ask about the beer, she waves one hand dismissively. “Don’t bother reporting me to the prohibitionists. We keep our own rules on Hemlock Isle,” she tells you, then gives a sidelong look to the porch. “That is, unless someone gets their way.”\n"
"You look in on the porch to see a gorgeous figure with skin the color of umber. They wear a trendy dress with the white-gold Vale cloak tossed casually over their shoulders as they embroider a floral pattern on a round frame. Bertie sheepishly questions them, holding up a few photographs and sketches of the sample that drew you here."

"Dozens of workers bustle around the base of a large tree in the center of the Crossroads. The many faces of the tree leer down at you with myriad expressions: some laughing, others pinched in grief, or terror. Each expression is grotesquely exaggerated. When you ask one of the nearby carpenters about the tree, they pause to consider their words. “This tree is the effigy. A likeness of—well, maybe it’s best to think of it as a heavenly spirit. The same spirit that lives on in each of us.”\n"

"The small chapel atop the Vale’s northern hill has a hushed, stately air. Small buds have been grafted in such a way as to suggest the planks themselves are blooming. While you admire the strange phenomenon, two women in white-gold cloaks approach. You ask them more about the chapel and their faith, and they usher you inside. A stylized quilt at the back portrays a warped, many-armed mythological being with numerous eyes and wings. “We built this chapel some twenty years ago, but it didn’t see much use until our revival. Mother Rachel has always called us ‘Children of the Stars.’ I suppose this is one such star.”\n"

"Dr. Marquez leans precariously on her cane as she takes samples of various wildflowers around the mill. “Take a look at this.” The professor holds out a sample that looks like a blend of brilliant violet, trillium, and lupine flowers, spliced at the stem. “It’s similar to the strange blossom that prompted the survey. Monopodial with dozens of different expressions. But no evidence of grafting. It grew naturally.” You ask how this is possible, and the professor grins. “It isn’t. Which is exactly why this survey is going to make my career.”\n"

We’re so happy you’re here.” As he pushes Sylvia inside, you hear rustling branches around the side of the house."

"The bell atop the schoolhouse rings three times as you approach, summoning children in animal masks. A young red-haired girl in a rabbit mask trips and falls on her way in, and you help her up. The thin, severe teacher invites you inside and gestures at the two bookshelves against the back wall: the Vale’s meager community library. A stately, middle-aged man with hickory-brown skin and a gray beard peruses the other shelf as you look at the library’s offerings: a few battered issues of Tales from Nevermore, a survival handbook, and a handwritten stack of old recipes.\n"
"“But where’s Edie?” one of the children asks the teacher. She replies in a sing-song voice: “Mother Rachel told me that Edie has found her place and that we shouldn’t worry about her. Now what do we say?”\n"

"“Hey! Gideon. No smoking inside!” the woman barks at an old man in a long blue sailor’s coat in the corner. He stands up and hobbles outside, grumbling. You notice the corkboard on the back wall is pinned with children’s drawings of plants and birds with extra teeth, eyes, and limbs. The woman breaks your focus. “If you ever wanna call for anyone back on the mainland or, y’know, send a gift to a special someone in the village, I’m your girl. You can call me Martha Jean.”"

"You meet Dr. Marquez and Bertie back at the Crossroads. After you each share some possible leads for the survey, the professor lays out the map of Hemlock Isle. “I didn’t expect the village to be so religious,” says Dr. Marquez. Bertie lights up in response. “They almost seem to be living in some transcendentalist ideal. I have no idea what they actually believe, mind you, but they seem friendly enough.”\n"
"“Friendly’s a word for it,” Dr. Marquez smiles grimly. “We have a good three days before the island is overrun with tourists. I hate tourists.”\n"
"“That sounds rather ill-natured given the celebration!” Bertie ventures. Dr. Marquez gives him a withering look. “What I mean is that they’ll disrupt the local habitats, so our time is limited. We can split up to cover more ground, or we can stick together. Theo has volunteered to drive us anywhere we need to go, and even said we could take his truck at night—though we aren’t to tell Mother Rachel.
