"You stand in front of the main temple of the Eztli, sweat pouring down your skin due to the hot, damp jungle air. Stunned, you examine your surroundings. José and Maria stand next to you, gaping in wonder at the temple’s sophisticated architecture. Their packs are bulging with the extra supplies they were able to acquire from Alejandro’s contacts in Mexico City. Alejandro himself stands at the rear of the group, grinning.\n"
"Your consciousness has been snapped so far back that your mind aches from the force of it. Your body shudders, and you struggle to resist collapsing out of exhaustion. Though you have altered fate, your true task still remains ahead of you. As the rest of the expedition sets up camp and prepares to explore the ruins, you sneak off to fulfill your purpose, leaving Alejandro and the rest of your group behind. They wouldn’t understand. They haven’t seen what you have seen."

"You stand near the main temple of the Eztli, sweat pouring down your skin due to the hot, damp jungle air. Stunned, you examine your surroundings. Several tents are set up in the clearing in front of the temple. José stands guard along the border of your camp, and you can see Maria packing equipment and provisions into her backpack, getting ready for her journey to the northern edge of the jungle, as you had instructed. Alejandro sits on a log in the center of the camp, decrypting the inscription he found near the temple’s entryway.\n"

"With your failure, the paradox of clashing timelines catches up to you. Despite all you have done, the events of the future cannot be unmade. You will always find the relic. You will always fail to preserve it. And the Nexus will always falter.\n"
"Reality as you know it will never be the same, but perhaps this is not the end of the world. After all, time is just one dimension: a dimension humanity barely understands. We experience time, but we cannot see it. We can measure it, but we cannot alter it. So what if the fourth dimension has split into hundreds of thousands of planes of existence? Our feeble human minds cannot comprehend the outcome, but the universe still survives, its ever-expanding boundaries no longer limited by the confines of time."

"No one else has ever learned of the events that truly occurred during the summer of 1925, and no one ever will, for I intend to keep this journal locked in my safe-deposit box once I have finished writing in it. I seek only to preserve my own record of these events, for I do not wish the passage of time to erase them completely. After all, these are not my memories, but the memories of my other self: the self who ventured through time and space to save humanity.\n"
"It is difficult to explain how we did what we did. After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember. Somehow, I remember everything."
