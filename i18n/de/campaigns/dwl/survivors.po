msgid "Inside the chamber that contained the terrible beast, you find the missing townsfolk and the others from Arkham; they are bound and shackled. You also find several documents that suggest the creature you found isn’t the only one of its kind in Dunwich. You free the creature’s victims from their bonds, and they offer you their thanks. You begin to plan your next move."

msgid "“It is far worse than we had thought,” Dr. Armitage says, pale and trembling. “Wilbur Whateley was only the beginning. There were more, many more in Dunwich, who knew of the ‘Great Old Ones’ and who desired power and knowledge above all else, the Earth be damned. I knew I should have burned that wretch’s journal. But thanks to its contents, I know how we can stop them. We are the only ones who can! Now quickly, help me with this solution—the powder is the key, yes, the powder is the only way...”"

msgid "“Dunwich’s had its fair share of oddities,” Zebulon explains to you with a quavering voice, “but I ain’t ever seen anything as sick and twisted as this...this...<b>thing</b>.” He gives the creature’s remains one last sickened glance before closing the door to the chamber behind him, shuddering. He locks eyes with you, his expression grim. “Whoever dun this gotta pay. I’ll do all I can to help.”"
