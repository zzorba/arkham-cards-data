"You awaken to the sound of screeching. Fearing the worst, you grab your equipment and head out into the streets of Dunwich. As soon as you step outside, you sense a foulness in the cold night air: an awful, pungent smell that can scarcely be described and a heaviness to the atmosphere that makes it difficult to breathe. The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below.\n"
"Flocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you, watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck. As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature — <b>Yog‐Sothoth</b>. Failing to stop this ritual may spell doom...not only Dunwich, but for the entire world."

"The path leading up Sentinel Hill is narrow and too torn up for Zebulon’s truck, so you park at the base of the hill and prepare to make the rest of the trip on foot. Just then, you notice that you are not alone. Several men and women emerge from the woods behind you, brandishing firearms and lining you up in their sights. You raise your hands and brace for the worst. “Wait,” one of them says, raising his hand to the others. “I recognize you from the Clover Club.” He grins toothily and lowers his weapon. “Naomi sends her regards.”\n"
"Curious, you ask what the gangsters are doing here. “Ms. O’Bannion had us investigate the attack on her fiancé’s club,” he explains. “Turns out there were some men in Arkham behind the whole thing. Some Bishop fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before he can explain further, the all-too-familiar ratta‐tat of a tommy gun echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny. Come on, boys!” He beckons to the others to follow and runs up the hill. Shaking your head, you do the same. These mobsters don’t know what they’re getting into."
