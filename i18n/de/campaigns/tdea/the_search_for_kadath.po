msgid "You stay the night at Einar’s Place. Your rest is anything but peaceful. Even if one could sleep within a dream, you certainly do not. Your mind teems with anxiety over the quest looming ahead. You reflect on the black cat’s warning about danger in the waking world, and you wonder about the others who have followed Virgil Gray down the steps of slumber and through the Enchanted Woods. Are they here now, too? Perhaps if you find this castle and return with proof of the Dreamlands, you can save everyone: yourself, your friends, and the other dreamers as well."

"When day breaks and light peeks through the curtains of your room, you notice a cat-shaped silhouette sitting in front of the window. As your vision adjusts, you are transfixed by its piercing yellow eyes, bright as the dawn light. You recognize the shape as Virgil’s talking cat. You ask the black cat how long it has been sitting there.\n"
"“Long enough to know you are neither waking nor asleep,” it replies paradoxically.\n"
"The nature of this world still confounds you. Can one even sleep in the Dreamlands? If so, where would their minds go? Curious, you pose this question to the cat.\n"
"“Those here in their physical bodies can, but you are something else entirely. Now, never mind all that. On to business.” The black cat leaps onto your bed. “I gave your friends the warning you wanted me to pass along. They are preparing to enter the Dreamlands as well, it seems. In the meantime, I will stay with you. Somebody has to watch over you and my pet human, anyway.”"

"In the morning, you find Virgil and Randolph talking in the town square outside of Einar’s Place. You still aren’t quite sure what to think of either of them, but you have a good sense of where you should go next. After all, this is not your first excursion into the fabled land of dreams. Addressing Randolph, you suggest talking to the high priest Atal in the nearby Temple of the Elder Ones. It is a name you heard the last time you visited the city of Ulthar in your sleep, though until now you had no reason to seek the priest’s advice. Randolph gives you a startled glance that transforms quickly into a smirk.\n"
"“How curious,” he says, “I was about to suggest the same. Atal is wise beyond all our measure. He may know where to find the place we seek.”\n"
"Virgil, eager to embark on this adventure, claps his hands. “Well, what are we waiting for? This way, my friends!”\n"
"You nod and head for the temple, a circular tower of ivoried stone crowning the highest hill in town. A small army of cats patrols its walls. The cat at the head of the formation is none other than the old cat with the scar you encountered in the woods earlier. He steps forward to bar your entry and regards your party with great acrimony.\n"
"“Hello again,” the old cat says with a sharp tone. “I suppose yeh want me to step aside.”"

"The next morning, you find Virgil and Randolph talking in the town square outside of Einar’s Place. Though you aren’t quite sure what to think of either of them just yet, you know that both of them are well versed in the lay of this strange land. You ask them about your next move. “We should speak to the high priest Atal in the Temple of the Elder Ones,” Randolph suggests. “He is wise beyond all our measure and may know where to find the place we seek.” You wonder aloud how far the temple is from here.\n"
"“Not far at all,” Randolph replies. “It stands atop the highest hill within Ulthar. Come, I will lead the way.” With Randolph taking the lead, you make your way to the Temple of the Elder Ones, a circular tower of ivoried stone protected by a small army of cats. The cat at the head of the formation is none other than the old cat with the scar you encountered in the woods earlier. He steps forward to bar your entry and regards your party with great acrimony.\n"

"“Well, too bad,” the cat says, tail stiff and straight. More cats flank you from the sides, several hissing loudly. Their fur puffs up, and their eyes flare with anger. “It’s our duty to guard this place from impetuous outsiders like yerself. Yeh ain’t wanted here.”\n"
"“Be reasonable,” Randolph implores. “We are only trying to speak with Atal. We mean no harm.”\n"
"“Yeh can mean one thing and do another.” The scarred cat paces. “Now get outta here and don’t come back.”"

msgid "You tell the cat that you are merely here to speak with Atal, and that you mean no harm. “Ah, no worries, human,” the cat says with a gaping yawn—the kind only a cat can perform and still look regal in the act. “You don’t seem the type to make trouble. ’Sides, I ain’t goin’ nowhere.” You see a small lump in front of the cat: a bloodied, half-eaten pheasant. You resist the urge to turn up your nose and count yourself lucky you are on this cat’s good side. “Go on in,” he says, then licks his chops as he prepares to finish his meal."

msgid "Resigned, you leave the temple on the hilltop behind. “I suppose we shall have to make do without Atal’s wisdom,” Randolph says with a sigh. “In any event, it is likely our destination is far from here—perhaps on another continent altogether. We will need to secure passage by sea. I suggest we travel south, to the port city of Dylath-Leen. We can figure out our next step from there.” You nod and take one last look at the stone temple, wondering at the knowledge you may have left behind."
msgstr ""

msgid "You inform the cat you are entering the temple one way or another, and that a simple cat will not stand in your way. “Wanna bet?” he growls, lowering his body and preparing to pounce. Noticing the commotion, several cats guarding the temple surround you. You don’t wish to harm these cats, but you won’t let them block you from your objective, either. Nodding to your companions, you make a mad dash for the temple gates. A storm of hisses and angry screeches erupts all around you as the cats mount a desperate defense. A wall of tiny claws and teeth meets you, but you push through, defiant. You slam the stone door shut behind you and hear the old cat yelling from the other side: “Fine then, human! See your priest! But do not think this transgression will be forgiven!”"

"At the top of the temple, seated on an ivory dais, the high priest Atal awaits you. He is a frail, wiry man with a long, wispy black beard, caved-in cheeks, and the pale, milky eyes of one afflicted by blindness. “Do not let your eyes deceive you,” Randolph whispers as you seat yourselves in front of the dais. “Atal is over three centuries old, but his memory is sharp as a tack.”\n"
"You ask the priest about your quest and about your destination: the castle Randolph described from his dreams. “You speak of the resting place of the Great Ones, high above unknown Kadath. Even I know not its true location. And that is all well and good, for the fruits of attempting to ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard from again. The gods of Kadath may seem powerless, but they are protected by the Other Gods from the Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. It would be wiser to let all the gods alone and leave this folly behind.”\n"
"Atal’s use of the word “gods” has you curious. You wonder aloud what kind of god might exist in a place like this.\n"
"The priest shakes his head. “They are not our gods, but the gods of Earth, for this land is but a reflection of yours.”\n"
"You attempt to pry deeper into Atal’s wisdom with your questioning, but his advice does not budge. “I have already said more than I should,” he insists. “Please, for your sake, pursue this madness no further.”"

msgid "A flash of inspiration strikes you, and you remember the moon-wine given to you by the Zoogs in the Enchanted Woods. You offer some to Atal, and he accepts graciously. You pretend to partake of the wine yourself while offering draught after draught to the priest. Eventually, Atal’s lips loosen, and he speaks of forbidden things he would never discuss were it not for the wine. He tells of an image carved into the face of the mountain Ngranek on the isle of Oriab—the likeness of the gods, or so he claims. He tells of the pillars of Kadatheron wherein the history of Earth’s Dreamlands is recorded. He tells of those slain by the hordes of Night itself and interred in the crypts of Zulan-Thek, the city of the dead. He tells of a baleful star above a forgotten city that appears on no map. “If you absolutely must seek Kadath in the Cold Wastes,” he says drowsily, “there is a city along the coast to the south: Dylath-Leen. You may secure passage there.”"

"You have ventured far and wide, from the quaint cobbled villages of the kingdom of the Skai to wondrous lands you could have never in a hundred years imagined.

In the meantime, your quest grows deadlier with each passing day. No matter where you go, foul, nightmarish creatures pursue you across land and sea. Winged beasts with no faces, horned Corsairs wielding razor-sharp cutlasses and commanding great black galleys—the agents of your demise bear many shapes. You decide to return to your ship, safe from the many dangers of the Dreamlands…or so you thought. Unfortunately, your ship is no safe haven. When you return, the crew and captain are nowhere to be found. There are no signs of struggle, but Virgil, who returned to the ship earlier to prepare for your next departure, is also missing.\n"
"“I fear the worst,” Randolph mourns. “If those fiendish Corsairs captured them, they are in dire trouble.
