Sometimes it looks just like an ordinary coin, albeit an incredibly ancient one from some long forgotten civilization. At other times, however, the air around it distorts and warps. You also know now from experience the ways in which it can make the seemingly impossible all too real. For the first time, you see a genuine smile on Isamara's face. \"I have to thank you for this. For getting it out of Abarran's hands. And getting it away from this place. I don't know what would have happened if you didn't. Tonight was bad enough, but nothing would have stopped Abarran from holding tight to his prize, no matter how many died along the way.\" You begin to gather your things, as Isamara does the same. You know that you will need to leave Monte Carlo immediately, as any of the Fortune's Chosen who have survived, including Abarran himself, will hunt for you and the Wellspring. \"I saw him one last time, before we escaped,\" Isamara explains, \"The look of rage in his eyes... Without his precious artifact he'll be even more unstable.\" You tell her that maybe he is the one that should be scared instead. After all, she successfully orchestrated his downfall from within. At your words, that same smile crosses her face once more. \"I could get used to that idea.\" With everything ready to go and the Wellspring in hand, you leave Monte Carlo behind, hoping your luck will hold."

msgid "By all accounts, escaping from the clutches of those horrible creatures and an army of casino staff and security could be called a successful night. Yet the Wellspring, the whole purpose for this ill-fated heist, has eluded your grasp. In the days that follow, you wonder if you are courageous or mad enough to try again, but the casino never reopens its doors and there is no further sign of Abarran or the Fortune's Chosen. The newspapers are strangely muted regarding the night's events, making no mention of the fantastical monsters that terrorized casino patrons. More than ever, it seems that some person or group helped Abarran set up his operation here and is protecting him after the fact as well. More importantly, after your attempted heist and the strange dimensional incursion, Abarran has taken the Wellspring somewhere far from here. It is possible that you could track him down and find some other way to obtain the relic, but for now, there are no leads and no sign of where he may have gone. You leave Monte Carlo, licking your wounds and wondering if you will have the fortune, or misfortune, of running into Abarran and the Wellspring again one day."

You stumble out into the daylight to find the city going about its business, as if nothing untoward had taken place. In the days that follow, the casino closes its doors for good. There is no further sign of Abarran or the Fortune's Chosen. You leave Monte Carlo, nursing your wounds and wondering if you will have the fortune, or misfortune, of running into Abarran and the Wellspring again one day."
