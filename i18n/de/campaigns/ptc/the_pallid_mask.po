msgid "You are stirred awake by dirty, stale air and dust in your throat. You are lying on a slab of cold stone inside a lightless underground passageway. How did you get here? And where is “here” exactly? A shiver courses up your body, and your hair stands on end. Rising to your feet, you take stock of your surroundings. Bones decorate the walls and ceiling around you, open-mouthed skulls peering back at you everywhere you look."

msgid "The contents of Nigel Engram’s home answer none of your questions about The King in Yellow, but do hint at where you should head next. The old, tattered map you found on his coffee table depicts a section of the infamous Catacombs of Paris. One particular room on the map has been circled with pen, and next to it is written: “The key to opening the Path lies here!” You swallow your fear and head immediately for the entrance to the catacombs underneath Rue de la Tombe-Issoire."

msgid "Just past the archway closest to you, you see a familiar symbol etched into the skull of a sheep: rows of concentric semicircles, lined with exotic runes. Two wavy lines descend from the design, leading into the skull’s lower jawbone. You recognize it as the pattern Haruko had shown you. Wondering why it would appear here, you examine the skull in greater detail. As soon as you touch the underside of the skull’s jawbone, its mouth suddenly opens. Bones collapse to the ground as the wall slides to reveal a new path."

"You are shaken awake by a police officer and lifted to your feet. You feel as though the weight of a train has slammed into your head. The pain is unbearable. The man shines a flashlight in your eyes and asks you several questions in French. Dazed as you are, you find it difficult to answer. He points toward the staircase nearby and pushes you away from the catacombs. You stumble onto the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire and slowly make your way to a hotel where you can stay the night.\n"
"Several days of research later, the meaning of the strange diagrams you saw within the catacombs still escapes you. You feel as though you have been led on a wild goose chase. Just as you are about to give up, you see a faded yellow book on the table nearest to you. You are stunned to discover that it is the unabridged script of The King in Yellow. Drawn on the cover in black ink is the very same diagram whose meaning you have been struggling to interpret for several sleepless nights. Who had placed it here? How had it come to your hotel room? Regardless, you know what you must do. The play holds the secrets—it has all along—and yet like a fool you have avoided reading Act II out of superstition. Its words cannot harm you any more than the creatures and fanatics you have already encountered. Trembling, you open to the second part, and begin to read."

"The burned skull holds the key to everything. You are sure of it. You have tried every method available to you in studying the diagram it bears, but the answer eludes you still. You have brought the skull to experts, occultists, and professors. You have even tried speaking with the skull on more than one occasion. Exasperated, you place the skull on your night table and try to get some sleep for the first time since escaping the catacombs. As you fall asleep, you cannot shake the sight of the diagram etched in the skull’s forehead.\n"
"You awaken with a spark of inspiration and rush to the Musée du Louvre, a famous Parisian museum housing tens of thousands of paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. You spend days exploring the museum—every display, every collection, every single object of art that might hold a clue to the diagram’s meaning. Finally, you see it: a painting depicting a beautiful island town weathering a torrential storm. Waves crash against the stone of the outer wall, the tide threatening to swallow the island whole. Lightning flashes around the tower of the abbey above the village. A whirlwind of black clouds churns in the sky above. The diagram from the burned skull you hold in your hands is recreated perfectly in the stained glass of the abbey. The title of the piece is “The Path Is Open.”"

"You fall ceaselessly through the empty abyss. No air slows your descent or courses through your hair. It is a passageway devoid of reality. Finally, you pass through an invisible gateway and enter another realm. Looming above and below you are two skylines, one a warped reflection of the other. A vortex of swirling black clouds and crashing waves lies in between them. You study both sides—the familiar city and its strange mirror. Could this be the path to Carcosa? A passageway between realities, where realms converge? If so, all that is left is to find where this gate appears on Earth. You fall into the vortex below.\n"
"You are shaken awake by a police officer and lifted to your feet. You feel as though the weight of a train has slammed into your head. The pain is unbearable. The man shines a flashlight in your eyes and asks you several questions in French. Your eyes widen with realization and you wrest your arm free from the confused man’s grip. “I have to go at once!”"
